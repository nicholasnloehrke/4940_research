1,I purchased this product not even a year ago and it already broke. I reached out to black + decker who was no help and referred me to the manufacture. I reached out to them and never heard back. I don’t recommend this product or black + decker since they don’t seem to care about their customers.
1,"We bought a cheaper Toshiba microwave, returned it because the top got REALLY hot and it sounded like it was going to explode.  Bought this one (more expensive) and HATED it from the start.  It is LOUD!  We put a piece of gorilla tape the entire way around it, which helped a little.  When you touch the “buttons”, if you’re not exactly in the middle it doesn’t work.  Cooking is definitely not even. Half the time you change the power level it doesn’t do anything.  There were times we had to unplug it to stop it.  If you make a mistake trying to program it, the screen goes blank. Do NOT waste your money!"
4,Pleased with the micro-wave. Good product.
2,I purchased this microwave a month ago and my impression is much different now. It is very cheaply made and already the number symbols are worn off. It seems to work for heating water and that is about it. Popcorn comes out very inconsistent. It has destroyed vegetable and potatoes when I tried to cook them. I would recommend against this purchase.
3,"The microwave oven works, but I find the buttons aren’t very responsive. I often have to hit buttons multiple times to register a finger touch. Aside from that it’s fine."
3,We’ve loved this microwave but less than a year into having it the bottom of the microwave paint has started chipping off. We’ve been very good about cleaning it and I don’t see any reason why this would be happening so soon after we bought it. Once the metals start showing it is more likely to have issues with radiation in the food and that’s scary so I’ll be having to buy a whole new microwave less than a year later.Also the 7/8/9 numbers never worked but that wasn’t a huge deal cause we worked around it.
5,"Love this microwave, easy to use, cooks well."
5,So far it still works
1,"Problems on arrival.  The oven shut itself off whenever it wanted, regardless of how much time left on timer.  The display fickered very badly.  Sent it back. Will update review if replacement is any better."
1,Well I only used it once.  Just now.. to heat up a frozen dinner.. followed directions and heated it for 3 mins..  well...dinner still frozen solid.  so i hit the 30 second button 3 times... still frozen.... tried again.. little bit cooked.. but come on!!!  This is suppose to be a 1100 watt oven!  Worked like a 110 watt oven.  Needless to say i believe I will be returning it!!!  Plus hard as hell to read.
1,broke after 3 years of light use dont bother
1,"bought this a few days ago, set it up and started using it.  First time, steam/condensation formed inside the door between the two glass panels.  So we're sending it back but in the meantime while we wait for the Panasonic unit we ordered to arrive we continued using this one.  6 minutes to boil a coffee mug of water, didn't think that was so good, then this morning I placed a Costco chocolate muffin on a paper towel and put in the microwave and set it for 30 seconds.  At around 18 seconds I noticed smoke forming inside the microwave (luckily this would be one of the times I stood there to watch it).  I shut it off, opened the door and the paper towel was on fire.  Didn't need the fire extinguisher, the flame died about a second after I opened the door.  Now the house smells of smoke and I decided not to eat my muffin.  Too bad, those Costco muffins are SO GOOD."
5,"Read a ton of reviews for microwaves and this one kept getting high ratings from various sites however several comments on Amazon were not positive. Decided to take my chances and so far I love this microwave. It is larger than my last one but of course I had read dimensions listed and expected this. The microwave when running is so quiet I have to keep looking that it is on. The settings are super easy and intuitive- mine arrived without a printed manual and while I did download one, it really is quiet easy to operate. The door handle is nice and sturdy and easier to deal with than the normal ""push"" kind on most microwaves and overall it also looks quite nice on my counter. Glad I decided to take a 'risk"" on this one!"
4,"Really like the price for this very strong microwave.  Defrost and other options work great.  It is a 1200 watt microwave so we did have to adjust from our 1100 watt microwave.  It cooks much faster.I would've given it 5 stars but the popcorn setting is way off.  We had to learn a trick of how long it takes to cook popcorn.  It took us 3 burnt bags of popcorn to find the sweet spot.  It's a small thing but just a warning.  Follow directions on popcorn packages and stay near them.  Other than that, it is a great microwave for the price."
3,The item showed up two days early. Everything seemed Okay. Noticed a large speck or dirt inside the glass door. Poor quality control.
1,Did not work door would not open
2,"After only 5-month use, the microwave started to make this high-pitched screeching sound... According to the research I did, it is very likely due to faulty magnetron. I checked the price of a new magnetrons, it costs around $100 which is about the same price as a 0.9 Cu Ft microwave LOL So I decided to replace it with a new microwave, of a different brand of course."
5,"This is a great little micro,Very quite, easy to use.Fits on my counter."
5,Really like this microwave especially for the price! Easy to use and easy to clean. Small size so great sitting on the counter and looks really good as well. Great purchase! Thanks
4,"The smaller footprint is nice, and it is fairly easy to operate. The controls are a little different from those I have used in the past, but not bad if you take the time to read the operating manual.The power level is less than I expected, most items take about 25% longer to heat than I am used to .Overall, not bad for the price."
5,"This red microwave works great and looks pretty. It's the perfect size for a couple or a small family. The red is more of a gloss cinnamon than red. The size for this red model: 18 3/4"" wide, 12 3/4"" deep and 10"" high. The measurements listed in the description must be for a different model."
4,"We doubt the power rating on this microwave. Frozen vegetables that previously cooked in 4.5 minutes take 6 minutes in this microwave.On the Plus+ side of things it is quiet, much quieter than the Frigidaire model this one replaced in our home kitchen.The light inside ours is always ON when the oven is cooking. The door is very easy to open.Good cooking to you!"
3,Not as well built and user friendly as past Panasonics
4,I like that it has a door handle rather than a button release for the door. I also like that pushing 1-6 on the keypad will automatically start the microwave with that number of minutes on it--makes it easy for my elderly mom to use! It's a good size for her current needs.
3,"It seemed to work just fine. The door opening is small for 1.6 cf. (more like 1.2cf) Once you get past the door, the sides and back are recessed a bit, but is still seems like a 1.4 cf at max. I returned for a larger size."
5,"We've had this for barely a year and it randomly started sparking up and making really loud noises. There was nothing unsafe inside while it was running. I've seen multiple other videos in the reviews showing the exact same thing happening. DO NOT buy this. It was okay in the beginning but with how unpredictable the time line for ""possible explosion"" is based on these reviews, it's completely unsafe."
4,"The product works great but man are the buttons very hard to see. The markings for minutes, temperature, and functions are gray and do not contrast against the black as well as it shows in the picture. Making it a little more difficult to use..."
4,Smaller than expected but does the job. Good value for the price.
3,"I replaced my old 1300 watt Panasonic microwave oven with this one.  I use a silicone popcorn popper with quality popcorn.  My old Panasonic popped corn vigorously and when popping slowed, you knew it was time to stop the microwave to prevent burning.  This new Panasonic pops sporadically, never giving any clue as to when it is finishing up  -- resulting in either too many unpopped kernels, or burnt popcorn.  Very disappointed in Panasonic."
5,"After years of tossing out mechanically fine microwaves when the pain inside began to peel I opted for a stainless interior.  I found those were hard to find.  So I purchased this microwave with the air fryer option as it was the least expensive stainless steel interior microwave I could find.  It has a large footprint on the counter, but after taking a deep breath I realized it did not take much more space than the large microwave I had there for years.  It just takes all the depth of the counter rather than being pushed back towards the wall.I haven't used the air fryer function and likely will not.  So I cannot speak to that."
5,Heats quickly. Mom is elderly stroke victim and it’s easy for her to use with the buttons and enough room on inside for her to comfortably put food in and out
2,"The microware by itself is quite sturdy and elegant looking. Give you the feel of having one of the commercial ones we see in busy cafeterias. But that is what you expect in this price range. I primarily got this model only for the sake of its air fryer capability because we don't have enough counter space to have a separate appliance in our kitchen.  To the air fryer capability I must say this is an absolute disappointment. The convection oven metallic inserts that come with this model cannot even balance food properly, let alone holding enough quantity. One would expect Toshiba to provide some kind of air fryer basket that can be used to hold food items like potato frying or chicken wings at certain height within the microwave. To me it is some what dumb on Toshiba’s part to design and produce an air fryer capable microwave and then let it down for not have an appropriate inserts like a basket"
4,It works fine. The door is a bit dificult to open
5,"There is only a small space in my kitchen to put the microwave , and its size is just right to put it in.  In addition to being smaller, its other functions can meet daily needs.  very good"
5,I saved up for this microwave and glad I did. It’s exactly what we needed here at home. Can’t go wrong with this product. Definitely recommend.
5,"Great product!!  Wanted an M-Wave that worked on low power setting without the on-off pulsing which can cause liquids to boil and then settle the foam before repeating the on-off cycle.  This unit delivers steady heating power so smoothly.  The user interface is not as intuitive as I would like but it works ok once you get used to it.  The turntable is a little clumsy to use if taking the glass plate in and out of the unit as the plastic turntable guide tends to slip off center which takes extra work to put the turntable back in to resume cooking.  Minor problem.  Large interior, fairly well lit for peeks during cooking.  Good power at full setting.Best M-Wave I have ever had with experience of 4 units over the years."
1,"It cooks OK.  However the glass tray rattles very loudly when it is rotating.  I have tried all sorts of remedies.  Nothing wrong with the roller ring either.  What works the best is a few layers of paper between the rotor and plate. Still rattles but not as loudly.I shouldn't have to do this.TOTALLY INEXCUSABLE.And when I say loud - I mean LOUD !It's like, when they were designing this thing, they went to the existing parts bin and chose parts that don't quite fit.  The spindle used to turn the tray has so much free play between it and the tray that it WILL cause it to rattle.  I'm having to ""pad"" the spindle with folded up paper and the dang thing STILL RATTLES!!Do people who design these things ever USE these things?Toshiba really disappointed on the design of this unit.Addendum - After much experimentation, I finally got the glass tray out of the old unit that it was replacing.  I put that tray into the Toshiba and the sound went away.  The older tray is an inch or so less in diameter but that is OK.  Comparing the two trays side by side, it is quite evident that the casting on the newer tray is too large for the spindle drive.  The older tray fits tighter and luckily is noise-free.My advice is to NOT get rid of your old microwave.  It came in handy for me.Still inexcusable.Addendum 2 - now eight months later the door glass is fogging up. Not on the outside. Not on the inside. But between the layers of glass where it cannot be be reached to be wiped off.WHAT A TOTAL HUNK OF WORTHLESS JUNK!!BUYER BEWARE!!"
5,"Best microwave I have ever used.  Went for a larger and higher powered microwave, definitely not disappointed."
2,I bought this for its features and size and power. very disappointed . loud buzzing  on right side. I believe the power rating is less than advertised as it generally takes much longer to get food at recommended temp of 165f than the food packages says .a frozen diinner package says cook on high for 6 minutes actually takes 9-`10 minutes to cook to 165fwould not recommend. had mine now for 5 months.
3,"Cons:Most of the reviews are correct, this machine is very loud, like twice or more louder than normal microwaves. Not as loud as lawn mover but very close to sit in a car.The button is not easy to press but still ok.It does heat the dishes a lot more than other model.Pros:The size is decent.Seem to heat things a bit more evenly.Overall:If i know it is such loud, I would probably defer for other brand. Sacrifice a bit of heating evenness to save my ear."
1,"I would not recommend this microwave.I bought the microwave less than a year ago and it recently broke. Specifically, it sparked while baking a simple potato on a plate. Luckily, I was next to the device as a small fire was starting and immediately stopped it. I’ve never experienced a product malfunction in this manner.Furthermore, what’s almost more disappointing is that my experience with customer service was awful. After the incident occurred, I called the company to explain the situation. I was told someone would contact me to rectify the situation, but it’s been weeks. I’ll update this review accordingly if I hear back from customer service and the matter is resolved."
5,I was concerned mainly with dimensions which were accurate and fit the small space I have in a pantry. Unit performs nicely although it is not as hot as the previous other brand I had. But it does its job and looks good.
1,"Listen, I'm not the kind of person to write angry product reviews. I try to be an informed consumer, I research products before buying them, and I try not to assign blame where it isn't deserved. But my experience with this microwave was ridiculous.Setup of the microwave out of the box was painless, pop the rotating tray inside, plug it in, you're good to go. The sensor heating worked well, operation was reasonably quiet, no complaints! ...for four days. On day five when attempting to defrost some hamburger, the microwave stopped working 30 seconds into a cycle and the display said ""H97."" A quick look in the user manual said of this error simply: Contact Panasonic Support. And here my troubles began.Panasonic's support website is labyrinthine, and does not list a support phone number. The first point of contact I could find was a live support chat. Clicking on the support chat link gave me a DNS error saying that the server could not be reached. I eventually figured out that the support chat line is only operated from Monday to Friday during Eastern Seaboard business hours, and outside of those hours they just... turn off the web server? Keep in mind that this is an international consumer electronics giant.Attempt #2 was when I found a separate page on the Panasonic website for making a service/repair request. Emailing the repair request email generated an automated email saying that I would get a reply within 48 hours. 48 hours later, I received an email telling me to call their support phone number, the one that was not listed anywhere on their website. But whatevs, I passed their first temple guard and now I had the magic number. I called the number, an automated voice told me that I could expect  a 30 minute wait before hearing a human voice, and that I might be charged a $9.95 service fee just for calling them(!?). Ok, I'll fight that battle when I get there. I follow through a nesting doll of ""Press 1 for X, Press 2 for Y,"" until I get to a menu for ""Consumer Microwaves that display an H97 error."" Jackpot! I Press 1. The automated response is, ""Visit the service request webpage to submit a repair request ticket. Have a nice day.""Listen, I'm not a luddite who is scared of phone robots. I know they serve a useful function by funneling calls to the appropriate channels of large corporations with millions of customers. But this particular phone robot made me want to travel back in time to 1995 and kill Dr. Myles Dyson before he can invent Skynet.I return to the computer the next day and try the support chat once more, making sure that I'm doing it during ""banker's hours."" The website does work this time, and I'm connected with what I'm fairly convinced was a human being. After asking the basic support questions, ""model number, when did you buy it, did you try turning it off and on again,"" I was given this stupendous piece of advice. By a paid human employee. Of the Panasonic Corporation, formerly Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd., established 1918.""I suggest you just return it to Amazon for a refund and buy another one.""Listen, I believe in science. I feel I know enough about electronics manufacturing to understand that sometimes, every once in a while, an appliance or device can be shipped with a defect, a bad inverter or a weak fuse. I know that my experience with Panasonic microwaves is not going to be a universal experience. Someone else's Panasonic microwave might last for twenty years without a lick of trouble. But know that if you ever do experience a problem with your Panasonic microwave, and if you attempt to seek support from the Panasonic Corporation, you will be drawn into a Kafkaesque customer service nightmare that will make you want to brick yourself up in the wall of a Catholic Church and become an anchorite.I did return it to Amazon. I did receive a refund. I'm not buying another one."
3,"I was replacing my 0.7 cu. ft. 700W microwave (RIP) with this one.  What a pleasant surprise.  It weighs half as much as the old one (which I had to lug to the Goodwill) and is more compact overall (dimensions-wise).  Yet it has the exact same inside dimensions and power.  It does everything I used to be able to do with my old microwave, and has additional handy features.  I tried out my usual plates, etc., inside, and everything I usually use fits, easily.  I like the option for timed- or weight-based defrost, and the instant 30 second mode is great!  It's attractive, too.  (I got it in black.)  Unless this thing croaks within a year or two, it'll be my best microwave ever!  Highly recommended.  An excellent buy on Amazon at only $65.One minor complaint:  The labels on the buttons for the most important functions are impossible to read unless there's very good lighting.  That's an inconvenience in low light, such as when heating up a late night snack.  The only way around this is to use the instant 30 second button at the lower right corner of the controls.Another minor issue:  The control  buttons have to be pressed very hard.  I use a thumb, whereas with my old mu-wave, I could use a gentle touch with any finger.  And since it's so light, when you press those buttons hard enough for them to work, sometimes the entire right side of the microwave (the side where the buttons are located) slides backwards! I've had to learn to hold onto the thing when I push the buttons.  Or re-adjust the position of the microwave if I forget."
5,Nice little microwave
1,"It spontaneously burst into flames one morning... fire stayed in the cavity, but it was scary, and filled the kitchen with smoke... I unplugged it immediately but would hate to think what would have happened had I not been there.Customer service is horrific. Can't get through to anyone without waiting at least 45 to 60 minutes, because it was past warranty they offered me a next to nothing discount on another GE microwave.In 2009 there was a class suit alleging that GE microwaves were prone to activate, and go on fire spontaneously due to a defect. Clearly, the issue is ongoing."
3,"Instruction manual included was for a microwave oven,  not this product.  I have no idea how to broil, bake air fry.  WTF?  This is a major company.  They should know how to include the correct paperwor.k.  I tried  to bake - and burned everything."
3,"I have mixed feelings about this microwave.  The microwave functions fine for microwave cooking.  However I found that the convection, broil, and air-fry all are lacking.  They are all much slower than using other appliances.  I am also concerned that there appears to be no way to clean the splatters from the broil feature off the roof of the microwave.  The manual only talks about cleaning the walls and the floor --- no mention of how to clean the roof.My other complaint is the manual is terrible.  Hard to understand and does not have any recipe suggestions or examples.  I have always found my other GE appliance manuals to be very helpful and well done.  GE should be ashamed of this manual especially because I know they can do better.If you are buying this for the convection, broil, or air fry feature you might look elsewhere."
5,"My behemoth of a microwave stopped working after 12 years. It was a 1.6 cubic foot microwave that was a ""mount under cabinet"" model. So replacements for it would have been between $300 and $500 (huh?). It's just me and my son and we use the microwave for heating hot water, frozen veggies/meals and popcorn! Why do I need a 1.6 cubic foot monster?!?! I tore out the old one, replaced it with a nice built-in shelf and placed the new black & decker microwave in its place. We love this thing. It is a bargain and it looks very nice works well. Yes, it will take a little longer to cook things since the wattage is less than some of the bigger ones but its no big deal once you adjust your times. I like living the simple life and downsizing when necessary.  This little microwave is perfect for us."
4,only complaint is that the glass turntable sips off very easily.It takes getting used to it.Nice little oven for 2 people
3,"Black on black, try to read the numbers in anything other than really bright light. Good luck even with my kitchen lights on. They are hard to read. And they’re the kind of buttons that car reviewers despise, completely flat with no contour at all so you can’t feel them either. So good work to Toshiba, very chic, looks before function . Otherwise, it works well despite the previously mentioned faults. I also thought I'd be getting more for the price, aprox. $130 compared to my previous one about $70 but not really.  The buzzer does shut off by holding the 8 key for a few seconds but with no backup battery, the power goes out and the buzzer's back until reset.  I wouldn’t buy it again, knowing what I know now."
1,This is the second Toshiba convection microwave that broke after 2 years or less. I had the extended warranty with Asurion and they returned the purchase price in 2 weeks because neither could be repaired . So prices have gone up and now I have so spend more for the same produce. If you buy Toshiba I would buy an extended  warranty. The microwave worked great. I had to add 50% to most convection cooking times. The last 3 days the plate would turn by itself when the door opened and then it died. Looking at Galanz
1,Avoid. Unit died the first day of use.
3,"Well, it works. And even bigger-sized plates. I like it, but always have to remind myself to increase the time to cook since it's low wattage. Also, smoke comes out if you leave something in there for more than 2 or so minutes cooking. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing or if my place will ultimately burn down.."
1,"Stopped working in under 3 months!! Went to use it and the buttons quit! Some worked but the next wouldn’t. I tried using the cook time to put .48 seconds in and the 8,9,7 won’t work and Amazon won’t help! Left it to the 3rd party seller! DONT BUYI HAVE NO MICROWAVE!"
5,Our old microwave went out.  We found this one with almost the same dimensions. Fits in wall just like older one.  Works great.  First one w/ Air Fryer built in.  We've used both functions multiple times. Works great. Would recommend.
2,"Purchased April 2nd, 2018 ..... died a smoking death on January 27th, 2020.  Lived a short life of 1 year and 10 months roughly. Kinda expected more than that. Got 20 years out of a Goldstar purchased in the 80s and 6 years out of our recent Kenmore. We purchased this unit for my wife's 78 year old mother who used it infrequently. It sat in free space on a counter top with plenty of ventilation space on all sides. So much for ""off-brands""."
5,Good compact microwave. Has a more modern look which is nice.
4,"It is actually a good unit. It has that tinny sound when closing the door (like an old Ford). I am using it as a replacement for an over the stove unit and it does the job well I may not bother fixing the bigger, more expensive POS. (Samsung)"
5,"Good quality, works well and is exactly what you world expect for a small microwave."
5,Working well … no issuesI like the size
3,Top had a dent when we took out if the box
1,"The microwave worked great for about 9 months then suddenly quit with an error code that required returning to the manufacturer for repair. Sounds simple enough until trying to communicate with customer service which literally took 2 months just to receive the required box and label to return. Still waiting for microwave!  Updated: However did this company get even 1 star?  Recieved back 3 months later. Used less then 3 days and it's dead.  Not only is the product crap, customer service is horrible.  Need to stop selling this  product!  DON'T BUY THIS YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!"
5,"We bought our first Alexa microwave in 2020 and loved it.  For a visually impaired person this was a wonderful addition to our kitchen!  Due to a power outage the old one stopped connecting to Alexa ~ still worked but the connectivity was what we needed.  Enter the new Toshiba!  It has a slightly smaller footprint than our old one so fit right in.  Set up was a breeze.  The inside is a bright white color.  When defrosting it actually says ""defrosting"" so there is no uncertainty.  So grateful for this tech!"
5,Love it. Been using for a few months and it’s been wonderful.
2,"It's easy to set up and use.  I'll give it that.  But it's way more noisy than any other microwave I've used.  Also, if I cook something on ""High"" say, for 10 minutes, it simply shuts off at roughly the 9 minute mark.  After a couple minutes, it'll kick back on again.  And then you have to reset the clock, etc.  The first time this happened, I thought it was broke; then it came back on and I hoped it was a fluke.  It wasn't, as it did the same thing a week later.  It seems to be fine (although noisy) if you cook something for less than 9 minutes.  Anyway, that's been my experience.  Maybe I got a lemon."
4,"Size just right and wanted 1000W or more. It does create more steam inside than any of previous ovens, have to wipe down interior 90% of time."
5,I'm very happy with this mainly because it's quiet (unlike the Panasonic oven) and doesn't smell bad like the Toshiba oven did even after cleaning it 8 times!
1,"This product was ordered on the 15th of May...arrived within 2 days and was set up for use. After less than a week of very light use, there was a loud buzzing sound coming from inside by the light...think of a how a bug zapper sounds. Even when it wasn't running it was still buzzing. Today, the 30th of May, after a 4.5 minute cycle to cook a potato, upon opening the door at the end of the cooking time, the entire microwave made a popping sound and died. After trying several different outlets (after assuring they were in proper working order) I'm sending the thing back. The outside of this oven gets extremely hot to the touch as well after running for very short periods of time. This is not the quality I've come to expect from Farberware and doubt I'll be purchasing any of their small appliances again in the future. Save yourself some time and money and get a Westinghouse or Black and Decker...stay far far away from this microwave."
2,"i bought this microwave in the end of 2022, just a few months and i starts having problem. i warmed  up my food for 1 minutes. i opened the door r.to remove food, suddenly the light turned of and humming sounds started, it was a continuous sound until i unplug it. i left it out, did not want to take a chance to hear this humming sounds again."
5,"My grandma really wanted a white microwave. I could only find one on Amazon, all the stores I went I only saw black or silver ones. The microwave is compact and fits perfectly in the small kitchen or small spaces. My grandma was very very happy with it. It is easy to use and doesn’t have too many buttons. Funniest thing though, all my grandmas friends at her senior home are obsessed with her white microwave!"
4,Really good quality microwave..... great when you have limited counter space.
3,"This is a solid, heavy, countertop model. Set-up is simple, and the instruction manual is clear. It's easy to use, not too loud, and when I open or close the door, the whole appliance doesn't skid across the counter the way my last microwave did. BUT...it cooks unevenly. Something homogeneous and simple, like spaghetti which was simply being reheated, was hot in some places, lukewarm in others, and even cool in a few spots. That negates all the good features of this machine. I'd rather have a noisy, skidding, complex microwave that delivers an evenly cooked meal. But it's too much trouble to pack this for a return, so I'll just have to add time to whatever I'm heating and hope for the best."
3,Heats food evenly but seems to be louder then most microwaves. Looks nice and I like the white light not the typical yellow light that’s inside.
1,"Critique: Poor cooking program options, small digital display, interior light not sufficiently bright to be useful, and after a couple months use the microwave started knocking during rotation and continually increased in severity.  When I activated the 1 year warranty the microwave was sent to a non-Panasonic TV and Sales organization for repair.  I later contacted the facility regarding status and was told repair parts was ordered from Panasonic in China with no  idea when they will be sent to the US.  Amazon Customer Service, upon my request, credited my account for the purchase price of the Panasonic unit and I then purchased a Toshiba microwave for less that turned out to be a far superior performing unit.  With respect to the promptness of Panasonic's response to honoring their warranty I filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and plan on avoiding any future purchases of Panasonic products."
5,I ordered this to replace a Sunbeam microwave purchased at Walmart and this was definitely a step up. The microwave heats quickly and evenly and has many pre-programmed buttons that make it convenient to cook common items easily. It looks great and is small enough to not take up too much counter space. I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone in need of a new microwave.
2,It broke didn’t last a year
5,Great Microwave
2,"Bought this micro wave back in April of 2021, today, May 12, 2022,  it decided to spark and die.  Not sure of the life span of microwaves these days, had one before this pruchase that lasted for several years, I thought this item would have lasted longer too.This had a lot of good reviews when I bought it, not sure if this is a ""one off situation""."
3,"It’s very loud, annoying loud!! But it seems to work fine. Looks nice, but it seems to be cheaply made. I’m keeping it as a backup, to much hassle to return it. Some Amazon suppliers make return process so difficult, especially if your located in a Rural area. Drive to the nearest ups hub is 250 miles round trip. No thanks."
4,It's lasted me awhile now. The only thing I don't like is that you have to push stop every time you use it to enable the power saving feature.
2,"Very disappointing.  The buttons are very hard to press/engage, taking at least 2 or 3 hard pushes before function selected will work.  That in itself I'd not worth the price charged"
1,I purchased this microwave in Dec 2020.  I live alone and it is not heavily used.  Within a year it started to develop rust inside along the seams even though I was always careful to allow it to dry thoroughly after use.  Now the paint inside the microwave has actually bubbled and will be peeling off.  I don't even know if it is safe to use.  I have had many microwaves in my long life and I have never seen anything like this.  Nor has anyone that I show it too.  I do not recommend that anyone buy this microwave.
3,Easy to use and looks great. Heats well but cheese melts a bit uneven getting hotter on the edges of the plate and melting less at the center. Not the quietest when in use. Still all in all a good value for the price.
1,"I like the air fryer and convection oven but the microwave side of it is horrible. It's very inconsistent on cook times. Popcorn for example. My last microwave always used the same time on the bag. This one, it either doesn't pop half the bag, or it burns it. I will be replacing this with just a microwave that doesn't have all the other features."
4,So far really like this microwave. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is when things are done it beeps 5 times and then goes back to the clock. If you are outside or didn't hear the beeper being elderly you might forget that you put something in the microwave. My old one would say ended until you took the food out.
3,This thing is REALLY noisy.  works ok.  If you press your hand against the right side of it while it's running you can cut the noise way down.  Clearly the manufacturer needed to install a 10 cent piece of insulation inside the cabinet to cure this.
3,It seems okay just no instructions on how to use all the functions.
4,We like the performance just like the old magic chef we had same company.//:::Don’t like the door very loud when closes okay for the price
1,"This microwave is awful! It will not run more than a few minutes before it stops running, like it short out or something. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MICROWAVE!"
5,Easy to use easy to clean cooks fast worth the money
2,Started sparking on the inside had my mom really scared. Was hoping to get more the 2 yrs out it. Had older ones last way longer smh
3,"The microwave is so light and the feet are not sticky.  Pushing any button had it sliding around.  I stuck a huge mousepad under it to fix it.  Um, did anyone test this device?"
3,COOK TIME key needs to be easier go see and more prominent. Its the key most often used. Badly needs s CANCEL key so when errors are made it's easier to redo an input from cramped keypad.
4,"I bought the built in kit to replace my kitchen aid microwave oven, which broke after 10 years service. This one is a lot higher quality and feels more high end and expensive. But the total price is cheaper than the lower quality predecessor.Usability is not that high as all other classic microwaves, still the last century technology, no blue tooth, no control from cell phone. But ver smooth to feel and operate.I believe this is the same oven as the dirt cheap Panasonic one offered at Costco, only this one has the real key/buttons compared to a flat keypad. Real key is harder to clean though, only feels more expensive, and can be more reliable than a flat control pad."
5,Worth it❤️
2,i am disappointed in this purchase. i feel i put a lot of time and effort into making the best choice for a new microwave. i made the wrong choice. and the price i paid - it should have been wonderful.
2,"A lot smaller than I thought, it barely fits a normal sized plate. The clock didn’t work when I tried to set it so it just says 0:00 all the time. The buttons are really hard to push too and the quick time cooking didn’t work. I have to push cook time and do it manually. Rather than just push 1 for a one minute cook time. The beeper when it’s done is SO loud especially if you live in a small studio apt. and it beeps like 10 times when it’s done. As if the fact that it stops cooking isn’t enough to know it’s done. I spent 80 bucks on this and I feel like that was too much. It’s just a little cheap feeling."
1,"The microwave is defective in that the controls behind the key pad do not match up.  So, you have to feelaround the named pad until you find the right area to press for the microwave to work.  I contactedToshiba and asked to have a repair person come out and fix it as my husband had just had surgery andwasn't allowed to drive while I don't drive at all and there's no way we could box it up and get it to thePost Office.  Toshiba said they had no repair people and asked me to send them the receipts, which ofcourse, is totally reasonable.  After sending the various information they asked for, they said they wouldturn it over to another department and that's the last I've heard about this matter."
4,So far so good but I have noticed a couple of problems.  The black finish shows finger prints.  I can see a lot of time wiping coming up.  The other issue is the electrical plug is a straight in type plug.  I am installing this microwave in a cabinet enclosure which forces me to buy a 90 degree plug adapter in order to have enough room. Oh well......
3,Noisy sounds like weed eater
2,Was better off buying a more expensive one considering how long it lasted
3,Alexa can turn the microwave on and off ans set the power level but other functions are inconvenient.  The clock does not recognize dst and the time is continuously an hour off no matter how many times we reset it. There are several sensor settings that are only available with the app on the phone. I don't think it is convenient to have to get the phone to cook fresh vegetables or oatmeal. Alexa does not recognize these sensor settings.
3,On the larger size if your counter space is limited.  The buttons aren’t as easy to use as my last microwave.  I tried to defrost some meat and ended up partially cooking it.  I haven’t figured out how to pop corn well yet.  I have a reusable microwave popcorn maker that worked great with the preset popcorn feature on my last microwave.  This one burnt the first two times I’ve used it.  My last attempt I managed not to burn the popcorn but a lot of I popped kernels were left.  I might try microwave popcorn packets and see how the do in it.  Works great for reheating leftovers.  That’s what I mainly use it for.
5,This microwave is small by roomy on the inside. I bought the microwave and the toaster oven as one. I would do it again because they are both very nice. Excellent deal if you need both get the deal online.
4,"For the most part everything works fine, my only issue is that panel buttons are not every responsive. Usually have to hit the stop/clear a few times to get it to take."
4,For some reason or other my first two units were painted white inside and this one is matte black that makes it very difficult to see the food cooking other than that same unit as before good power easy open door I wish it would last a couple years longer but they all seem to die in about three or four years
5,"Needed to replace my Panasonic microwave when the interior, after only 2 years of use, the interior started to crack and rust (?!). And everybody complained that they don't like the twist-set-time controls, so I picked this one, a slightly smaller microwave with push-button controls. Not that there's a big difference between 1000W vs 1100W. The interior is slightly smaller, not that I ever put a large item in there to heat.I have a feeling the previous microwave interior was not properly coated, and I cook a lot of instant noodles with regular water, and that does generate a lot of steam, and if you don't vent the interior, you do get a bit of condensation inside. So extra tip for microwave maintenance: when you boil water in microwave, vent it, then wipe down the interior once a day. If there's an exhaust fan that blows out the stuff after your cooking's done this is would be perfect, but one can dream.The controls are easy enough, and there's a bunch of 'quick set time"" buttons... Press 1 will directly give you 1 minute of full power, 2 for 2 minutes, and so on. Who really uses all the settings in their microwave anyway? It's full power, or defrost.  :DNoise is about normal for a microwave,Anyway, so far, so good. the exterior is ""stainless steel"" kinda finish, and it does look a bit weird with some dirt on. So we'll see how that goes. if something changes I'll be back to report the results, but so far, it's good."
4,"Quite powerful for the 700w rating. Most microwaves pull 30+%  more wattage than their label, mainly due to losses, and the outside label ""power"" is actually providing the consumer with the heating power input into the food. In this case, I believe the the ratings are inaccurate. This little unit sure does pull a lot more juice than its advertised heating input. 1280w/700w=1.68 or 68% more than the heating input power! It does heat food well however, and i would expect it to witht hat much power draw. It isn't a full sized beast-mode microwave, but will do the job with ~ 15 to 30 seconds longer operation. I would love to find a microwave that can lower its heating power (lower wattage to say half, 600w) on lower power settings, this one and most other I know of, just turn off the heating element for brief periods to let the heat even out in the food you are heating, then they turn back on and resume heating. This is observable on the killa-watt as well."
4,"Everyday heating up food, easy to use"
1,"I purchased this for my mother because it was small and would fit in the space she has for a microwave.  It just doesn't cook food well.  I'm not sure why - it has a smaller compartment than many other microwaves, so you would think that it would cook the food that is actually in it faster since it has less to heat up.  But, it doesn't.  Oatmeal that takes two minutes to cook in my microwave takes 5 minutes to cook in this one.  I'm going to replace it with a different one, but it really is a pain to try a product and have it work so poorly."
3,It’s an ok micro. Good for small spaces and a regular size dinner plate fits inside. The control panel is difficult to see without light and a little confusing.
5,"You definitely have to read the book and learn some commands, but it is great. I’m blind, so I use bump dots and thankfully I only needed to put them on a few buttons. That’s a big plus for me. It’s quiet it has so many functions. We haven’t even had a chance to try many of them but you can usually tell right away if you’re going to love some thing or not I definitely give this five stars."
1,Bought it in Jan 2022. Today is November 2023. The microwave was burnt while being used!!!! Terrible. Will not buy this brand again
2,It seemed okay when I first brought it. We are looking for another one. We got this one in February 2020. A little over a year later and we need a new one.
5,We primarily bought this model because we are looking to upgrade our boat I'm the next year and most boats have a combo style microwave as the only oven so we wanted to practice using air fry and convection in a microwave.  What we didn't understand is that convection and air fry are basically the same function.  The instructions were basic but fine.  We do like that this is a fast version vs our full convection oven.  Overall a good microwave and easy to use
4,WISH THE SETTINGS WERE EASIER TO SEE~!
4,"I'm sorry I did not see the ""alexa integration"" which is useless to me--I hope not too much of the price was for this feature.The microwave works great (easy to use, etc.). My only problem is that opening the door requires me to hold the microwave with one hand before I open the door to prevent pulling the microwave to the edge of the counter (or beyond, but I have always stopped it). The door is very hard for me to open. My spouse, however, does not have a problem."
1,Its huge and  SUPER loud.  I hate it.
1,"I received the microwave only 2 1/2 months ago.  From the beginning it was pretty loud.  The grill took twice as long as it should have to cook the hamburgers when I tried that feature.  Last week it started making a really loud 'growling' sound and cooked/reheated even slower than previously.  Following the warranty in the users guide I contacted the manufacturer who informed me that since I had purchased it from a third party through Amazon, the warranty didn't apply to me; it applied to the original purchaser, i.e. the third party seller.  So I contacted the third party seller who basically said thanks for buying our product but our warranty is only for 30 days.  SO VERY DISAPPOINTING.  The third party seller is SmirStore.  I will avoid all their products in the future."
1,"Barely lasted three years. Turned into a fire hazard. Started overheating and smoking when plugged in and not turned on. It was only a stroke of luck that someone was home when it started happening. Also, settings and operations command are non intuitive and confusing for older people. Strongly suggest you avoid."
2,"We already have one of these microwaves, a great small microwave. But this one came in original packaging, but not in original box. All that was in an Amazon box. When we opened the box, it was not well secured nor prptected and the glass door arrived shattered. We've returned it, and this is entirely a shipping problem, not a Toshiba microwave problem."
5,I roasted a whole 5lb chicken. I was great. Just like a rotiss
5,Brand new. 1st class product for the American family.
4,"I got the regular microwave not the one with the crispy function. I already have an air fryer and a toaster oven so I really didn't need that function.But as far as a microwave goes it does the job. It's not quite as good as the old 80s Panasonic it replaced, but as people say ""they don't make em like they used to"". And it kinda applies here.This one doesn't cook as fast and slightly uneven but I've used much worse.So I'd place this in the middle, not bad but not exceptional, just a decent microwave.Only time will tell on how long it lasts."
1,"I am very disapointed with this microwave.  About the only good thing on it is the stainless steel finish.  This microwave is TINY.  Tiny as in you can't even pop a bag of popcorn in it! Once the bag inflates, it's too big for the plate to spin without getting stuck on walls.  Also, you can't dial in specific times! You have to select the number of minutes you want and add :30, terrible if you need something to heat for a specific time.  Again, really disappointed."
4,"We needed a small microwave for the basement to do simple tasks like frozen microwave meals, appetizers, popcorn, and hot beverages. This is perfect for that!This unit actually makes better popcorn than our large kitchen unit.our biggest requirement was the size. The small fingerprint of this unit is just perfect for our limited counter space.The only slight downside is it takes slightly longer than what we were used to but after all, It's a microwave. It's still fast!! Instead of 3-4 minutes for popcorn it's 4-5. No big deal.Love it!"
1,Everything was fine till it overheated and quit working.  However Amazon backs it for only a few months and it lasted only 8 months.  I could have gotten a better deal at the local Walmart and they would have exchanged this obviously defective product.  You live and you learn.
2,Works fine but dented after a month when closing it.Edit: 2 stars as it is getting harder to open and shut after 1.5 months with it.
1,"Had to return, defective/ didn’t work"
5,"Bought a used one for 1/2 price and love it.  I would never use the warranty on these things.  If they are DOA we just use Amazon to process the return and we have never had one that broke after lasting a few weeks.  What I like about this is the size.  The next smaller is shorter but has the same footprint.  This one is tall enough to defrost most anything you might be serving.  It is quiet too.  I also like the 30 second timer rather than a 1 minute timer.  The defrost cycle is magic.  Our old one would hit or miss, usually toasting the edges of whatever while leaving other parts icy.  This seems to know how much power and what cycle time to use.  Burger comes out red, not brown or white.  Neat.  Sensor reheat brings stuff to about 160 degrees,  Also nice.  A decal on the door might be a nice idea for sensor cook.  Remembering the settings is not something I will spend my mind on.  I'd even pay a couple bucks for a nice decal that related 1-20 to the application.  Sure it is in the book but who keeps the book handy?"
3,The microwave seems to work fine.  Just be warned there were no paper instructions in the one we purchased.  Found everything online  but still nothing in the box on integrating it with Alexa or even how to operate.
3,"I think this is a little too compact and too weak for regular use. Bought this because my standard one went out of commission.I stilll have it because I use it lol and it works, but ideally something slightly larger and more powerful would be better."
3,nothing fancy but it does the job and is easy to use
1,"After six months purchase, and fairly light use, the unit has failed.  The manufacturer acknowledged that the unit is at this time within the warranty period.  The product support is a labyrinth of bureaucratic obfuscation and shifting between recorded responses that alternate.  After a thirty minute wait and several attempts, I spoke with a ""technician"" whose only support was ro suggest my transporting the unit to a service center approximately 60 miles away.  As I write this, I've been on hold on the telephone a second time for more than 20 minutes waiting for an answer to a question about shipping.  Not only would I not purchase this product again, I can see no reason to purchase any Panasonic product given the apparent poor quality of their products and no reasonable policy to address their product failures.  My wait time is now over 25 minutes.  In addition, the ""technician"" has what I perceive as an adversarial attitude throughout.Update, the final wait time for the second call was over 32 minutes.Second update, February 9, 2017After lengthy, very, and not particularly cordial discussion,  Panasonic tech rep agreed to send a container to ship the microwave to be repaired.  I delivered the container with microwave to a Fedex office across town and it was shipped prepaid to its destination.  About 10 days later it was returned and now appears to be functioning as expected.  I'm relieved that the purchase was not a complete loss, but, I'm fairly sure I'd like to avoid the very adversarial process by which the outcome was achieved.  I believe that my sincere outrage at having a complete equipment failure after six months  use may have helped this resolution, but I would have very much preferred encountering a sympathetic and helpful attitude, given that I feel that the failure was Panasonic's responsibility.Third update October 12, 2017Repair made under warranty in January has failed, so that for the second time since the purchase in July, 2016, this microwave is not useable.  Panasonic refused to take any responsibility for correcting the failed warranty repair. The only communication available was a chat line exchange with an unsatisfactory outcome.  Amazon has indicated that I may receive a refund - possibly partial - upon their receipt of the microwave under an authorized return.  Amazon's customer service was a huge improvement on Panasonic's. which was effectively non-existent.  Panasonic's customer service telephone number plays a recording stating that there is a $9.95 charge to speak with a technician if the product involved is no longer in warranty, directs the customer to their online site, and terminates the call.  It was very difficult to find a Panasonic customer support telephone number, which is kind of academic in any case, given their response.  I  continue to wonder how Panasonic's marketing group regards their customer support."
4,"I love the way this microwave looks, cooks, and the size! It is so loud though, it's unreal the buzzing noise it makes while on, I have to leave the room.  Granted I am sensitive to certain sounds.  I'm still keeping it, and may try to safely soundproof it."
2,"I used to love Panasonic.  I was biased to look at Panasonic first because of good past experiences, and it generally gets very good reviews.I DON'T LIKE THIS MICROWAVE.  I'd return it, except that it isn't legitimately non-functional.1. The first one we got WAS legitimately messed up; it was maybe 3/4 as powerful as the unit it replaced which was rated at a lower power.  I had to exchange for a refund.  Boo.2. It interferes with WiFi.  Running this microwave oven kills existing connections and prevents new ones.  That all clears up as soon as the oven stops. 100% correlation. Boo.3. It's loud.  This thing sounds like a wind machine when it's operating. Boo.4. This of course is purely subjective, but I don't like the way the keypad is laid out, and it's hard for us to operate in low light.I would not buy it again and I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Kind of underpowered but it looks cool with the the RCA label
3,"It's confusing to use, The door is very hard to pull open & you need both handsYou have to hold it with one hand because it slides when you pull the doorI'm very frustrated over this purchase"
1,"Bought on 7/23/2023, noisy, has overheated & stopped working several times, basic junk, but too late to return now per the 30-day return limit of Amazon."
3,"Inverter is great. A bit noisy. I prefer the dial model. New model (this one) has a slighty mirrored door which is absolutely stupid idea because it's hard to see inside. Otherwise 5 stars.EDIT:After 5 months of light-moderate use, as compared to a very similar yet older model (still Inverter tech) I'm reducing my rating to 3 stars.Why?Because the damned thing heats evenly EXCEPT IN THE CENTER."
5,I love this microwave so far heats up the food fast and the food comes hot with just a minute it's 1000 watts. The microwave is also quiet it's not loud at all. It looks modern and digital. Plus it has air fryer setting as well.
5,First time I bought an appliance on line and very happy with it. Outside is small and inside it big. Works well.
5,"Love the black & silver trim. Very powerful. Arrived on time, undamaged"
4,Excellent microwave
1,"Avoid. Purchased one on 02/25/2017, and it died on 10/11/2017. Unit was always used within proper parameters. Severely disappointed at having to buy another one so soon..."
1,"This is a case of you get what you pay for, this microwave is so light, that when you open the door you risk pulling it off your counter top, also the glass plate on the one I purchased seemed ill fitted, so did not work smoothly. I did read reviews before I purchased and am wondering how people gave it more than a one star!"
3,It will hold a dinner plate but smaller and not as powerful as I thought it would be. Wouldn't order again.
5,"It is hard to find microwaves small enough for our space, and they don’t seem to last. We have had many different brands and so far this is the best. The button to open the door works with light pressure, so you don’t end up shoving the oven around like our last one. It seems quieter overall, and if you can’t get to it soon enough once it is done, it offers a single, polite beep to remind you. (Our prior one insisted on making 5 loud beeps no matter when you got there and opening the door didn’t stop it.) My only complaint is the darkness of the menu pad. It sits above our under-counter lights and it is nearly impossible to see the menu aine the evening."
2,"Im very disappointed in this unit. I bought it to replace an existing farberware microwave that finally failed and couldnt be more in shock about how lousy this model is. It looks nice, but when its running it sounds absolutely horrible, almost as if its going to explode. Even the light makes a huming noise when the door is open and the unit isnt running.Id return it, but stupid me threw out the box before actually using it. Its complete junk and I cant believe I wasted my money on it"
4,"This microwave looks very nice in my kitchen. It's a bit loud, so that's the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. I've never had a microwave that could heat up food automatically without even having to set a time or a weight or size or anything. It does it with sensors and it does a really good job of getting it right. If you use a food cover to keep your microwave clean, it messes with the sensor reheat, and it doesn't work as well."
5,"As a senior , reading the numbers on the keypad was very difficult because of the fine font printed on the black background. Having the keypad in reverse colors would be much better.  The size and performance of this microwave are excellent for my needs ."
4,Works perfectly fine but requires a light to read the keypad.  I keep a magnetic portable light above the keypad in order to read it and punch the right keys.  Too bad there isn't battery backup for the clock.  In the country our power flickers often and messes up the clock time.  My wife wanted a small microwave so the glass plate could go in the dishwasher.
1,I bought this microwave as we’ve had good experience and long life with our previous Panasonic microwave.  This one caught fire on the side internally.  Thankfully I was standing next to it when it made a low pitch growl and caught fire.  All I was cooking was two peppers wrapped in a paper towel.  Unfortunately I didn’t buy the warranty since the previous one lasted for five years.  This one made it seven months.
2,"It seems to me they should make the top higher. The inside space is small. It is low power, but that's okay because the benefit is that it draws less current. I don't like bigger ones because of that.Update: After using this 700W model for a while, I find that pressing the buttons is annoying. They are black and hard to see, and finding the right spot to press is pretty difficult. Plus, the door is hard to open as others have said."
3,"I wanted a bigger convection/microwave which this is but with it came much difficulty to use. I kept it and plan to continue to study directions because it is a nice size. I do believe that the instructions could be written better and more simpler. The instruction book should have not included both directions for both the microwave and the convection together which became very confusing plus the auto bake directions. I guess to be expected when the oven is able to do so much, but be prepared to sit down and study as this oven is not a just touch a couple of buttons and go."
5,"This was a replacement for another Japanese microwave.  A deeper model that still fits the counter space and works well.  It arrived very quickly, too."
5,"The media could not be loaded.This microwave is a perfect size. Fits well over my mini fridge in the office. It’s really quiet and cooks well. It has quick start numbers and an add on 30 secs. It also pre-programmed setting for popcorn, potatoes, pizzas and more. The stainless steel color is very nice and easy to clean. I’m very happy with this microwave and I would highly recommend it."
1,The control panel was broken off the front of the microwave...and there was a dent in the bottom of it that caused it to wobble...I couldn't return it because I tried to glue the control panel on and it never would adhere to the microwave... so I'm out some money...☹️
3,It works ok but it's extremely hard to see the numbers/options to set the cook time and I have really good eye sight.
3,"The microwave is very small which is nice for fitting on the counter.I just got my microwave today so I can't really give an accurate review of how well it works or how easy it is to clean but I wanted to share a review showing that the internal dimensions listed are off by quite a bit.I should have known based on the tray measurements that it's really basically ten inches deep and ten inches wide, but the height is the real issue...it is only six inches high, not 8.11"" high as listed.This is disappointing because I was trying to make sure my microwave popcorn popper would fit and it juuuust barely does NOT fit. Which is sad.Anyway to avoid this heartbreak for anyone else I'm sharing these photos to make the measurements more clear."
3,I believe I'm going to like all the functions of this microwave except the one that the control panel isn't back lit.  WTH!  I'm still not sure if I am going to return this unit or not.  Having to use a flashlight to operate it is a real pain in the a$$.  I will never understand a manufacturer not realizing what an issue this would turn out to be.  I can't even see to operate this unit in bright daylight.  It's hard to believe that more customers aren't upset about this.  Who is making the engineering decisions at this company.  Not a fan!
5,This Microwave is Huge inside … Exactly what I needed and wanted …. It’s Got All The Bells And Whistles … Would Highly recommend
5,Love my new microwave was in my price range and easy to operate love how settings were easy to use not complicated at all
3,Instructional sheet omits explanations of codes the screen puts up. Clearing and starting over requires patience until user figures out bypasses.
4,"We ordered this for use in our [very small] kitchen at our office. It's a nice microwave. Besides being pretty sleek, it seems to work well. The only reason I'm deducting a star is for the size. I understand the dimensions are laid out clearly, however, the cooking area seems to be significantly smaller than other microwaves of this size. We find ourselves regularly coming up with creative ways to microwave larger meals.Otherwise, we've been happy with the purchase."
4,"Great size and value with an Air Fryer.The panel though is difficult to see and read especially at night, a lighted panel for controls would make this an excellent product."
2,"3 popcorn quick buttons and none of them cook the popcorn as well as my Panasonic 1100W did. In fact, there are NO one touch/easy buttons on this thing. 1-minute items now take about 30 seconds longer to cook than my 1100W did. I guess it has one neat feature on it though. It has an auto reheat feature that actually works pretty well. I guess that is the inverter technology.Overall, I wish I could just buy my old Panasonic unit again. This Panasonic NN-SN936 works well enough that I won't be returning it, so I guess that is a plus. Thanks for your timeUpdate less than 45 days later. This unit now smells like it is catching on fire every time it is in use. I saved the box just in case I needed to return it and to my surprise I found there were 3 spots on the box where the shipping label had been removed before. Buyer beware! If you receive anything that has another shipping label on it. I recommend sending it back immediately!"
4,"The microwave has a habit of turning its self off if it overheats. Which was concerning??? I'm not sure if it's supposed to do that, but other than that, no issues!"
5,Good buy
2,"I would not buy this microwave again. it is heavy, loud when in use, and quit heating in the 10 month of ownership.I have receipt but would be cumbersome for me to carry, in order to return to store."
2,"Micro, convection eh. It does neither very well. It takes WAY too long for the convection to heat up and the microwave is middle of the pack. I do not recommend this and would not buy again."
5,"I like the ability to have a microwave and air fryer all in one. Less space I have to give up on my counter. I actually found out about this microwave at a place I was renting, prior to I was using a whole separate unit. This combo does what it’s supposed to do, easy to read buttons between air fry and regular microwave use, works great, easy to clean if need be. I recommend it"
5,I like this microwave it has many different settings settings I didn’t even know existed
4,"I really like this microwave. it's very powerful and fit well with my other appliances. The inverter tech is very different from a standard microwave and requires that you adjust time/power on almost everything you're used to using the microwave to do. Things that used to be a minute at full power are a minute at power level 2, and things that used to take 5 min to cook, I often start with 3 and see if it's done. It takes some getting used to, which they state in the user guide that comes with the device, but if you experiment a bit, you will get the hang of it quickly."
1,"Have to choose 1 star because it worked at first and then after 1 mo. it began quitting in the middle of the time set. If I set it for 30 sec., it would just stop at 10. Not sure whats wrong with it, but we wasted our money because we can't continue to use something that seems to have an electrical issue."
4,"My other brand microwave finally burned out - literally!  It was an early sleepy Sunday morning and making my breakfast before the mad dash out.  Get the food, open the microwave door, close the door, put in the time, hit start, run up stairs to wash and brush, come back down for breakfast to come down to the smell of burning electronics.  Dope!  I forgot to put in the breakfast, cooked nothing and terminated the microwave.Quickly scrambled to check the internet and reporting magazine to see what is the current recommended microwave?  The reporting magazine seems to be all pointing toward Panasonic models as their top scores but the models they review was out of stock or been discontinued.OK what should I do?  Let me just search Panasonic Microwave here to see what comes up.  I came across this one.  Over 6000 reviews, majority positive and high ratings.  OK.  Place order.Pro:- It's a microwave!  It cooks stuff and tells time!Con:- Noisy like H-E-Double-Hockey-Sticks!  That was the first comment the whole family gave me when I warmed up my simple breakfast for a minute.- Maybe sometimes cook food un=even or I am not used to this one yet.  At time half the food is warm and the other half is hot.  Stirred it all up and then I get warm food.  Pop it right back in for another minute.- Power button is confusing.  Usually other brands said medium is 50% but this one said P-06 is for medium.  At P-06 seems to burn my food.  I dropped it down to P-05 for less burn.  Also, you press the power button to set your desired power, then enter the time and hit start.  There is no indication after start on the display to tell you it is cooking at a different temperature, P-06 or 60% for the desired time.  I kept on wondering if I did lower the power or will it burned my food.- When cooking is done, it will beep 3 times and that is it.  Old brand will beep again after each minute to remind you the food is ready.  If you walk away, come back, you do not know if the food is cooked.  Does not said on the screen like the other brand.  Or if you forgot to hit the start button and there is just cold/frozen food inside.  Other brands will continuously say food is ready.- Magnet for fingerprints on the door open button/handle.  No matter how many times you clean it, it comes back next time someone opens the button/handle.  Another nightmare that did not happen with the other brand.In the end, well it's a microwave.  It has a few quarks and missing features.  Will I buy this one or this brand again?  Hmm… I will probably go back to my old brand or try another.  I want an upgrade and not another downgrade."
5,"Great little microwave if you don't have a lot of space. We're having our kitchen and dining room remodeled, so our 10×10 sunroom is currently our kitchen and our dining room. This microwave is perfect for our temporary displacement, and doesn't take up much of our very limited table space. One thing that wasn't mentioned, because so many different microwaves are listed here, is that this particular one, the RMW741, is 700 watts."
3,With all the features this microwave has we were expecting it to have a little more impact on how we prepare our food.  First off the digital keypad can be a bit tough to enter the cooking time and whatnot... We've also found that the airfry feature doesn't work near as well as our countertop air fryer.  We've stopped using that feature at this point.  It does cook food though and it is fairly quiet.
1,False advertising! Product description falsely claims this microwave is made in the USA!!! Just more China garbage.
5,Bought it for daughters college ; no complaints!
1,After only 2 yrs the thing starting making a weird noise and filled the room with smoke.
5,"I'm not a fan of microwaves thay have ""fast buttons"" where if you press 1-6, it automatically goes for that much. I'm a baker and often have to melt butter or chocolate and you can burn things easily if you can't set it for 10 seconds at a time. Plus, some things only need say a minute 45 but you're doing a couple of things at once and whoops it went for too long.I know that's kind of a nitpicky thing but it's what I prefer and this microwave lets me set the specific times I want."
1,This microwave did not even work when we plugged it in. I noticed a dent in the rear vent of the microwave so I can only assume that quality control was neglected before packaging. Not Happy....
1,"When I was looking for a new microwave ,and also wanted an air fryer, I thought this product would work.There are no instructions for the air fryer. Toshiba actually admitted they had no information on how the product worked. The  manual has a chart; the unit has a button. What do you use? The glass, the metal frame, the grill dish? Who knows? The review I found said it is not really an air fryer; the air fryer is part of the convection oven, but i could not find any information on how to use it. when the manufacturer doesn't know , it is not a product I want.The deceptive labelling comes in when the air fryer is listed first as in "") Multifunctional Microwave Oven with Healthy Air Fry, Convection Cooking. . . If it does not function as an air fryer, why claim it does, except of course to sell more units.It is going back immediately."
5,"I had to move into an apartment temporarily after a move, and since my previous home had a built-in microwave, I needed to purchase one. My counter space is limited, so I needed something small. Because of that, I was ready for less-than-stellar performance, but this unit surprised me. It's hard to believe it's 500 watts less than my old microwave, because it actually heats and cooks things in the same amount of time, like my oatmeal and popcorn. I'm very pleased with it and as long as it keeps working properly, I feel it's a great buy."
4,"The Nameplate data for the Panasonic Inverter Microwave Oven model No. NN-SN67KS says that the power required is 12.4 Amps at 120 VAC.  I measured the power actually used when heating a cup of water at about 17 Amps with 114 VAC at the receptacle.  The receptacle that I used has a grounded outlet with a 20 AMP circuit breaker and has 120 VAC with the Inverter turned off.  Page 6 of the Owner's Manual says that "" The Oven must be plugged into at least a 20 Amp, 120 V, 60 Hz., GROUNDED OUTLET"".  The Inverter would definitely need a 20 Amp circuit since it requires about 17 Amps to operate.I wonder why the actual 17 amps that I measured is 37% higher than the UL listed 12.4 Amps?  This Inverter replaces a similar Panasonic Inverter that I bought in 2010.  My old inverter also used about 17 Amps and the Nameplate said it would use 12.7 Amps at 120 VAC.Other than the higher Amperage required, I am happy with the Panasonic Inverter Microwave Oven."
1,Delivered broken. Doesn’t work
3,"Very small! It is a bit misleading also, it isn't as nice as it looks as advertised."
5,"I wanted to use this Microwave a few weeks before I gave it a review.  So after using this microwave a full month,  I'm very happy with it and giving it 5 Stars.  This is a very solid build microwave and not at all clunky. At first I had issues with the turn table coming off track. I removed the guide and snapped it back into place and made sure the glass plate was in the proper position. Since I did that,I have not had a single problem with it since. It is a very attractive microwave that would fit in any kitchen. This microwave exceeds my expectations and is a bargain."
4,Gray microwave but way smaller than I expected
5,"This is the greatest microwave - it is so easy to use, quiet and perfect for our needs. We don't ""cook"" in it - just use for re-heating, frozen dinners and coffee mainly. Love the instant 30 seconds and 1 - 6 minute buttons.  Some reviews said the 5 beeps at the end were very loud but we don't find that to be a problem.  Thank you for this wonderful ""user friendly"" microwave :)This is also the quietest one we have ever had - I have to really listen to make sure it is on sometimes."
3,Easy to use. Has a quick minute button. Easy to clean.
4,This shipped all the way to Hawaii with zero damage!  So much smaller than my previous microwave and takes up way less space!  Very pleased with this compact micro!
3,"7 months later after buying the microwave, and the microwave's waves are interfering with the WiFi. It is small and I thought it would be fine for everything I needed to make, however popping a bag of popcorn is difficult. Depending on the size of your popcorn bag, it may burn the side of your microwave (as in picture) or the bag because the bag will not turn when it gets too big. Also, you used to be able to hold and press the number 8 to silence the microwave, but the feature seems to not work anymore for us, and I cannot figure out why."
5,"Pretty intuitive and carefree once you reprogram yourself as to button location and function. Other people seem to use the microwave for more than defrosting and/or warming up a cup of coffee so that may be why a few dissatisfied folks, but in our view it performs perfectly well after the past two or three months and we'll see how it works out long term. Meanwhile no complaints. Bought it for the name brand.Installed with the surround, which was somewhat easy given my dimensions of the original microwave (a Kitchenaid, lasted 22 years) and the cutoff was close dimensionally, so do make sure you understand your dimensions and follow the directions if you are at least semi-skilled with tools and measuring for the microwave itself and the surrounds clips to align. Not including a pic since it looks exactly as others previously sent in."
3,The dimensions given for the RMW1414 are incorrect. It's 17 x 21.5 x 12.
4,"I knew I was buying a good valued micro oven...I had been using it for around 6 months now, and I have had great service with it...It has many different stages for each button on it, which is great...There is a menu to use to know which stage is present for each dish...In the past good ovens lasted like 4 years...The name brand on this one, I generally got like 4- 7 years of service with these...It is easy to clean...The size is another thing I like about it too...At the moment, I can't say enough about it...It was worth my price..."
1,"This microwave stopped working about a month after I purchased it. It was for my office and was only used 2-3 times a week during that month. I called customer service and was given a case number and work order number that I was to include in an email to customerservice@curtisint.com, along with the receipt, pictures of front and back of microwave, etc. They told me that I would hear back from them within 3 days. It's eight days later and I still haven't heard from them. I sent a follow-up email yesterday. Still nothing. I would not recommend this product or any other product that Curtis International does warranty work for. Customer service is non-existent at this point."
1,"All started with some loud noise inside near the diffuser. Few days later the noise became louder and some kind of electric shortage with intense lightning could be seen through the glass door. After repeating the same twice again, we gave up and bought a Toshiba again. Just wasted $219.00 plus tax."
5,I got this because I use in microwave mostly to heat water. I rarely if ever cook in it. I will reheat leftovers. For this It excels. Very pleased with my purchase
3,The power level is just ok. I now need to warm food for much longer to heat it up properly. I should have gone for a much higher wattage microwave. It's just meh...
1,"Purchased October 7, 2019. Loved the look of it, but in recent weeks started making a popping sound when turned on for cooking. For the last 2 days, it's been making a loud, high pitched, intermittent, screeching sound when cooking, the turntable is moving in slow motion, and smoke appeared when I opened the door. l am replacing it with another brand as I'm afraid it's a fire hazard.  From reading other reviews from those who have had similar problems, making a warranty claim is essentially an effort in futility.  Will not purchase another Farberware  microwave in the future."
4,"Works well and is really quiet, which im not sure is a good thing because i never hear it go off."
1,Waste of money as no longer works after seven months of use purchased new.  Piece of GARBAGE.
5,"It’s a microwave and a crisper, duo purpose and awesome."
3,"It’s probably the most spacious microwave inside considering the average size outside.I noticed food cooks more evenly, even on highest power setting.Dislikes: I was most disappointed in not having one touch quick starts for different times (even cheap microwaves offer this). My old unit and many new ones just press the 2 and it starts running for 2 minutes. No one likes to press 3 buttons to warm something simple.Also, when shutting the door, it is very loud with a reverberating after rattle. I figured out a way around it if you push the button before closing the door, then let go of the button. Other wise the door will easily wake sleeping babies or others when shut.I’d also like a feature to shut the beeping off or turn down."
5,"Nice microwave, looks ands works great"
3,"+ it works+ not very expansive+ clear buttons, easy to use.- Package. I would say, it was not packaged at all. It was just luck, that it was not damaged. As minimum externally.- noise. Its noisy. And this is result of pure assembling.- legs. Extremely cheap. Cannot be used for most table tops without additional covering."
5,It's compact and light. Love it. Perfect size for my kitchen.
3,"There’s a lot to like, and also, a lot to hate about this microwave.The Good: Peace and quiet1.  It’s silent if you want it to be.  No beeping at all.  No beeps even when you hit buttons.  Unlike other microwave manufacturers, Toshiba gets that most consumers don’t want the beeping.  If they do, they want it to be minimally intrusive.  You don’t need five long, loud beeps when one short beep is sufficient.2.  It runs very quiet.  It’s easily the quietest microwave I’ve ever had.  It’s hard to tell when a job has been completed, but I will take silence any day over loud beeping.3.  It has one nice feature in the interface, and just one.  As the microwave is running, you can add 30 seconds to the job simply by hitting a button once.The Bad: The interface is a mess.1.  Except for that one nice feature, the interface is horrible.  Who designed this?  The way they’ve marked the buttons makes no sense.  I’m always hitting the wrong buttons.  For instance, the button for starting the microwave is entitled “Power Level.” You’d think that button would be prominent, easy to find, and have color.  But no, the only button like that is the “Stop/Cancel” button.  For weeks—before I had any coffee in the morning—I’d intuitively hit the Stop button thinking it was the Start button.  Both buttons appear to be one button, but they’re actually two buttons, four altogether.  You have to learn how the buttons are mismarked and that what doesn’t look like a button actually is.  Googling this model shows that it has an alternative interface panel with a big green button for Start and a big red button for Stop.  Wish I had received that version.2.  The buttons are hard to successfully hit.  The panel is flat which makes it difficult to know whether an attempt to hit a button was successful.  There are no little bubble things underneath the buttons.  Half the time, I push them hard and nothing happens.  This becomes problematic when trying to set a specific number of seconds.  To do that, you have to hit “Cook Time” first.  You can’t just punch in the number and hit the start button.  So when I hit “Cook Time,” and punch in the number of seconds, it automatically starts running for 1, 2, or 3 minutes.  That’s what happens when you think you’ve hit “Cook Time” but didn’t.  Then I have to hit the Stop button and do it all over again.  This happens almost every time I try to set it for a specific number of seconds. The interface panel is a mess.3.  Occasionally, the interface fails to work at all.  The only way to fix that is a reboot—unplug the microwave for a few seconds and plug it back in.So for the interface, I give it zero stars.  It actually deserves less than zero.  But the ability to easily turn off ALL noise is 5 stars.  So I’m giving it 3.  Would be 5 if the interface was just halfway decent."
5,Was Gift and receiver was thrilled about it!!
5,"Works great, heats fast, stylish and a good med. Size, easy to use, bought for mom but will buy for myself when my 16yr carousel dies"
5,Great microwave for the $.
4,"Works as it should - heats evenly, fits 11-inch dinner plates.  No problems - it's a lot quieter than the old microwave we had."
1,"No me agradó  que el producto en pleno conocimiento de  que es usado; llega en unas condiciones que no es operativo, es un riesgo hasta encenderlo! De riesgo total . Muy molesto por el engaño de que es un usado y funciona. Negativo......"
1,That’s about it... so u can fit more into it at one time but this was probably one of my most hated purchases on the amazin Amazon lol Had no standard features like 1 push button start. For $200 you would think that it would come with that feature. Just over all reminds me of a microwave you’d find in a very elderly persons home. Nothing modern or sheik about this expensive hunk of metal.  Extremely disappointed but too bulky and too much of a hassle to try to send back. Guess I’ll keep it till it dies out on us. 🤷🏻‍♀️
4,"seems to be an overall good microwave? But I personally have 2 opinions about it1. When the microwave runs it kind of sounds ....off? Now this does a NOT effect the way the microwave runs however when you start it and start to walk away it makes you want to mid stop and turn and look like uhhhm...ok...lol its just a bit off but otherwise runs just fine so far.2. ***IMPORTANT*** Unpackageing. You know how you get excited and take all of the plastic off and  get everything out so it's ready to go? Well upon opening the microwave- You see some things you have to remove in order to get it going. Unbeknownst to my husband- there was what LOOKED like cardboard on the SIDE on in the inside that I 110% agree looks like it would have been another piece to remove before 1st use...apparently its not supposed to be removed? Why is there not something that makes this clear? Because now we have a $130 microwave that has a bent piece inside before the 1st use. Yeah it's inside and just a small square piece but after spending this much to have a nice microwave to (match out fridge btw huge point i spent this much for a simple appliance) I'm kind of bothered about it. Wish there was a better warning that this wasn't supposed to be removed. That's all...So...all in all is it worth it? uhhhh welll. For looks and a usable microwave, sure. (the inside is super pretty vs the old plain white microwaves we're used to).. But for the cost? I don't quite know. It doesn't sound right and it doesn't have the proper instructions so we don't mess it up before we even get to touch it.  Maybe this can help someone who is looking to buy this product. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANT SECTION BEFORE PURCHASE! Other than these 2 issues guys it's not horrible and looks great with a chrome on black fridge in the kitchen as well (;"
2,"This microwave was great, until it wasn't! The side burned out like this in the month after our two year warranty expired. Pretty disappointed!"
2,"I can't believe I'm not reading more complaints about the glass plate never staying put. I have to readjust it ALL the time because there's no real groove for anything to stick. Otherwise, it's a fine."
3,"Much too big, my ordering error. No other problems."
5,Just what I wanted
4,"I am in a wheelchair, so I was unable to use my regular microwave machine. So, this machine sets on the sink and is easy for me to use."
2,"Showed up with a broken plastic piece rattling around inside. It caused the panel on the right side with all the buttons to be loose on the bottom half. This made it harder to open and close the door. Not wanting to send it back and be without a microwave for longer, I glued it back together. It's a 900 watt micro so you have to cook longer if you're used to having a 1000 or 1100 watt version. It's noisy when it first starts up but then quiets down a bit. Just typical cheap throw away crap of today."
3,"First, the microwave works fine.  It heats fast and evenly.  However, I now use only the timer number buttons.  The power button is an inconvenient serial button.  It must be pressed repeatedly to change the power level.  My old microwave had convenient buttons for each power setting.  None of the ""genius"" features work as advertised.  The popcorn button has several levels.  The highest does not come close to popping most of the kernels in a standard bag.  Now, I just press 2 0 0 for 2 minutes and listen.  The smart sensor cook and reheat features are also worthless.  I am stuck back at learning new time settings for everything and attending more closely.  This is a good microwave but not worth the price for special ""genius"" features which do not work.  It is too soon to evaluate durability."
5,Works great no problems
2,"I just got it and it’s dented all over! The box is in perfect shape however, the problem must be from the manufacturer itself. I am very disappointed."
5,"Okay, it took some adjustment to using this microwave as it seemed unnatural to microwave in a metal box!  But, the microwave works great - it's just like a normal microwave.  I use the broil option on the tall stand to make toast/bagels - takes about four minutes.  Very happy with this purchase as it combines multiple appliances into one and helps to keep my counters clutter free."
1,"Worst piece of crap microwave.  Will not start.  I tried turning on/off.  Will not start.  Very unhappy.  I will never buy from Farberware again. Due to the virus, you can’t call Amazon customer service.  Cost too much to send it back.  Guess I have to take a loss on this purchase.  Should have gone to Walmart.  Very unhappy."
5,..but I can't get it out of the box.Too heavy and I need it to cook. So it sits in the middle of the floor.
1,"A microwave should last for years. It was not a cheap one.Used occasiona;y, and no longer works after a year light use"
3,"You have to make sure there is enough light in the room to see the controls on the front. The numbers should be brighter along with the cook time, defrost time and functions like that. Not real happy with it."
5,I love this micro wave! I use it to heat left overs and make oatmeal. Does not take up a lot of space can use my larger dinner plate and my microwave dish cover. I knew before purchasing it that takes longer to heat food that is no big deal. Great deal for a lower price
5,"This microwave has perfectly replaced my old one which finally conked out for good.  This one looks great, is easy to use, and does the job--you can't ask for more than that."
5,"I wanted a white one to go with my new color scheme. Sides top handle and trim around the white front is a silver stainless metal color. This Farberware is beautiful works great.Sits medium size on my countertop. My last MW was over 10 years old. So happy I stepped up to this one.The interior is actually pretty as the round glass plate on the bottom actually sparkels a bit from the nice interior light, the interior a nice shade of grey. It cooks Fast I had to get used to that !Buy it ! Farberware has done a nice job with this one!"
3,"I replaced my old Panasonic microwave which was a tank, but worked brilliantly. He didn’t die it was just so old that I decided he could no longer be cleaned, and it was using way too much power every time I used it. I owned it for 35 years. This new microwave is very noisy, the rotary portion of it is clanky And wobbly and makes a lot of noise when it runs. It is a small microwave so the powers not great, a big difference from my old Panasonic which was as I said a tank. All in all not a bad microwave had it for over a month and that’s far it has worked for what we use it for; mostly reheating things."
2,"Was very disappointed with this microwave. Had it a little over a year and it started making a terrible noise while cooking (like there was a metal item in it) and emitted a terrible smell. Finally was done with it. Before that, the light would go off for days and it was sounding bad. Timer is terrible - you can’t cook while it is on and it only makes a noise once, (not continuous until you shut it off). Also, and this might be my bad, I had to cook everything twice as long. All around just wasn’t happy with it. Got a new one today - not Toshiba though."
4,Smaller BUT I love the extra counter space. I can put things on it. Just big enough to turn a plate. I've adjusted and love it!
5,this is a very clean looking micro  sharp lines  easy  to use works great  love the many different functions would but it again  if needed
1,"The microwave stopped working after 2 months of light use, the Amazon return window had closed so I contacted the manufacturer and they only responded to one email and haven't responded in over two weeks despite my two emails asking for an update."
4,"Will take time to learn.  Easy, clean up."
3,Ordered through Amazon warehouse. I liked it while it worked. Found a  better price on a new model so bought the same model & am liking it.
2,"I tried very hard to love this microwave, honestly, I barely even like it.  Instructions are horrible, for the most part there aren't any.  We tried to air fry, still can't get that to work, and everything takes 5 times as long if you are baking with the convection function.  It works fine as a microwave, but that wasn't what I wanted and paid for.  If I wasn't outside my return window I would return it but alas I am stuck with it.  It may get donated as a lesson learned and just buy a less complicated basic microwave."
5,"Got the 1.6 Cu.Ft version. I've read some other reviews that said the clock/timer display was hard to see, ours was very easy to see.There was one review that said the touch buttons were black on black, that's not true as they are a sort of silver'ish grey (like an aluminum color) on black and are easy to see if you are looking straight at them in a well lighted room. When you touch a button the actual touch point is very slightly up and to the left and not in the center of the button where its more intuitive to press. Plus it would be better if the silver'ish grey was white and not silver'ish grey, the 'wording/writing/numbers' for the buttons would stand out better if they were white.So my first suggestion for improvement is that the button press spot be in the center of the button where its more intuitive. However, this being said, its ok after you get used to it but I noticed my senior aged next door neighbor who came over to visit to look at the microwave because she wants to buy a new one, she tried to use it and it wasn't very intuitive for her slightly shaky hands not having a definite intuitive point to aim for.My second suggestion for improvement is that It would be nice if the controls panel buttons were lit. As it is right now even though the control button locations are visible in a well lighted room looking straight at them, in a more dimly lit room or are looking at them off axis (not straight on) they are not as easy to see to older eyes even though still visible if you look more closely and directly at them. Lighting them would help.Contrary to that implied/stated by the advertisement there is not a ""one touch popcorn button as kitchen essential"". To do popcorn without doing a timed cook by entering the cook time manually you use the 'Custom Cook' functions (page EN-25 - EN-26 in my manual in English). The one for popcorn is CC-6, you press the 'Auto Cook' button 6 times. But there is a problem with CC-6, and that is if you look at the manual you will see CC-6 is set up for 3.5 ounces of popcorn and this means if you use the 'mini bags' of popcorn which are about 1.5 ounces and use CC-6 that your popcorn is going to overcook and burn. For the 1.5 ounce 'mini bags' the cook time is 1 minute and 10 seconds and you need to set this manually and can't use a 'Custom Cook' function. I can't find a way to 'program' the 'Custom Cook' settings, and although I have not tried each of these settings with the items shown in the manual (or a comparable weight/portion of something else) to that shown, I suspect that anything outside of that manual listed 'weight/portion' would either over cook or under cook if a 'Custom Cook' setting was used. So my third  suggestion for improvement is to allow a user defined 'Custom Cook' function to be programmed in and saved for recall later.Yes, I realize this thing costs ~150.00 + tax... so I don't expect 'super duper luxury' type improvements, and these suggestions I know would be ignored and maybe they could be viewed as sort of nit-pickey in some ways. But if you want a decent microwave this one works well and works as advertised except for that advertised ""one touch popcorn button as kitchen essential"" thing which does not exist."
1,"This was okay while it lasted. It caught on fire with flames escaping the door, melting part of the menu. We had to toss it and don’t recommend this one. The door was very tough to open but if it hadn’t caught on fire we were fine with that. Lasting ess than one year, and danger of fire makes this a zero stars."
4,"Seem to work fine. Like the look. Has feet on the bottom so slides easily, will put some no slide rubber sheeting under it"
3,Very cute little microwave but a regular bag of popcorn once the bag starts to expand cannot continue to spin on the turntable as the bag edges get stuck on the side walls of the microwave. Even some disposable plates are too big to spin. Other than that it's a great little microwave for a dorm room or family/entertainment/rec room/game room/man cave/etc... as a main or kitchen microwave opt for a bigger size.
3,"This microwave was smaller than I thought it would be.  My old one was 1,000 watts, but this one took longer to cook things and sometimes it did not cook the middle like the outer edges.  I did return it and bought a GE 1200 watt that was over 2.0 cubic inches.  This might be fine for a small kitchen and for someone willing to add a another minute or so to the cooking."
5,"Best microwave I've ever had, heating time is quick so be careful, but excellent microwave, best  I've ever had."
5,"Meets our needs.  We don't really cook-up meals in the microwave.  It is used mainly to reheat left-overs, melt butter for cooking/baking and defrost food.  This microwave works fine for those purposes and hasn't been a problem.  It replaces a 10-year old off brand microwave that stopped working.  Great replacement!"
3,"The microwave part works great. Very fast cook times, but I didn't buy it for just that. I wanted Alexa integration... And it's not good. First, it's a 3rd party app that connects to Alexa. 2nd, it's sporadic on whether it works or not. Then it's too complicated to simply do a 45 second time. If I had a second chance, I wouldn't buy it again."
5,"Just bought it and out of the box very easy to set up and use. Just had to take a minute to read how to use the one button presets like beverage as you need to hit the button (once or twice depending on cup size) them hit the number of cups you are heating at the same time. It is nice and small and fits right on my counter top. Perfect for an apartment, heating frozen dinners, vegetables, and popcorn. My spouse loves popcorn so could not wait to try it and it did well with an regular sized bag on the popcorn button (3:00 minutes).I did my research and found this very well rated on several review sites. I cannot stress enough - read the verified reviews as they will often point out cons that might be deal breakers for you and always try to go to some independent review sites to get their take as well."
5,Set your time by pressing user pref. Good god. Happy 4th.
4,"No lie. I picked THIS COMFEE' EM720CPL-PM Countertop Microwave Oven because you can turn off the beep. I don't know why no one else includes this as a feature. Also, it replaces the 21 x 17 x 13 behemoth that took up my whole counter to warm coffee and leftovers. This little guy is cute as a button and so far has warmed every cup of coffee to perfection. AND I CAN TURN OFF THE BEEP!!!!One little hitch. As you can see in the pics, if you bang the control panel while the door is open the panel will shift a bit. So, this may not be the best made microwave in the whole world, but warming a cup of coffee withoput waking up the neighbors with 6 or 7 BEEPS is kind of worth it. I'll report back if it gives me any serious trouble."
1,Terrible microwave. The screech sound it makes when the inside table spins is piercing to the ears. And the amount of time it takes to heat simple items is longer than any microwave I've used
1,The bottom of the microwave was damaged
4,"I'm more than happy with it.  Several years ago my former one wore out, and I never got around to replacing it.  This Farberware oven is a pleasure to use.  I'd forgotten how handy microwaves are.I have a big  concern about the delivery.  The delivery would get one star.  I have Prime, but it took a couple of days longer because the carrier made two attempts and said the building is not accesible due to the fact that this is a secured building.  The sign on the wall says to punch in my apartment number and this will call my cell phone.  I went to the post office and talked to the little supervisor, who sounded sweet and nice, but I doubt she said anything to the delivery guy because it happened again."
4,"This Farberwear oven weighs 35lbs, measures 16.5 x 20.1 x 12 inches and has 1000 watts of power. Aesthetically, I find it very pleasing with a combination of stainless steel and black accents with blue LED lights.What I like most about this microwave is:- It's powerful. 1000 watts offers enough power to heat through just about anything you can throw at this oven.- Presets. I use the popcorn, potato and pizza buttons most frequently although there are 3 (frozen veggies, beverages, and dinner plate) more. These presets tap into Faberwear's ""multi-stage cooking"" which is a fancy tech that automatically adjusts the power settings while your food cooks to heat it evenly without over/undercooking it.- 1-touch controls. Being able to push one button to add 30 seconds or select numbers 1-6 to get corresponding cook times is a quick convenience.Cons- Dark inside. The internal portion of the oven is covered in a gunmetal finish. I find it too dark for my liking.- Capacity. While this has a respectable 1.1 cu ft I found that dinner plates of 10"" or less worked best in this unit. Anything more, like say serving platters were too big.Overall, this microwave from Faberware is on par with other microwaves in this price range. It nails my essentials which are power, presets and 1-touch controls but it was both smaller and darker inside than I desired. Still, this is a solid 4 out of 5 offering from Faberware."
2,Came missing the oven turntable
2,Not the right size.
2,One reason I bought this particular white microwave was to match all my white appliances with led BLUE lighting! Soooo disappointed that the listing is clearly wrong and the lighting is GREEN not BLUE! I’ve attached two pictures for reference. Ugh!!
5,"My last microwave was 20 years old when I replaced it with this one and I am impressed with the streamlined look of this and the sensor reheat button that seems to read my mind to know exactly how warm I want my leftovers! I do wish the cord was about a foot longer, but that is a minor issue."
2,"We have had this microwave for about four years and just recently it started to die. It's beeping like crazy; won't stop, all different beep noises whenever you open the door or push buttons.While it worked fine for a while I expect kitchen appliances that were maintained carefully to last longer than this."
2,amazon took back turn table quit turning
1,This is a piece of junk. I’ve had it two weeks and it only works occasionally. Don’t buy a GE microwave.
1,"I have only been using it for a few months. Today I was heating something. Suddenly there was a loud noise inside the microwave. It felt like the wires were touching the wires inside. I quickly turned it off. When I opened it, I could smell the burning wires from inside the light！It was terrible. If it is used by children.  I can’t even imagine encountering such a situation!"
5,"I’ve only use it as a microwave and a convection oven so far but everything‘s been great. I love the compactness of having everything in one. If anything goes wrong, I’ll let y’all know, but at this point, it’s a really good buy."
3,Black interior stops the tiny LED from distributing the light. It's very dark inside.I got the white exterior model. Nice looking but the bright white mesh of the window prevented mefrom from seeing if something was boiling over. I had to turn off the kitchen light and get a curtain to darken the kitchen so I could see inside.
5,"After pricing a defunct above the range unit, including installation, I decided to leave the old one in place & replace with this one.  It doesn't take up too much counter space, is attractive, and is large enough for frozen dinners & leftovers.  I placed it on a rubber mat to keep from slipping on my smooth counter top.  $50 bucks delivered to my door, and everyone who touched it between China and my home had to make some degree of profit......I don't understand how they do it.  This is a nice attractive unit that would be perfect for a dorm room, and is also nice for a downsized family.  Delivery was fast as usual. Im very pleased thus far."
2,"The power levels can not adjusted. Only has the equivalent of PL-10, which works well.  Defrost is the same thing unless you want to thaw an ice cube and turn it into boiling water.  This would have been an excellent replacement for my old one that did right by me for 17 years which ironically was a GE model"
3,Cooks well.. but very loud 📢
2,"The microwave was perfect for my space and was working correctly until one day it turned off. I unplugged and plugged again but it was dead. Called the manufacturer. The initial customer service was fine, they asked for my receipt promising to work on a reimbursement.Weeks past by and no news. Called and now they want to see the delivery fee and taxes paid in the receipt. (as a Prime member I don’t pay delivery fee).Called again the third week, and now they need proof of payment. I explained I paid with my credit card to Amazon. Nothing is due at this point. They have nothing to do with how i pay my credit card. They insisted I have to prove then I paid for the microwave (!). Don’t  know what to do. This seems to be a dilatory tactic so customer abandon their claims for this lemon."
3,"This microwave is loud, louder than units in the 2 cu ft range.The button interface is poorly laid out and you'll find yourself pushing an extra 1-2 buttons to do simple things.The cooking timer alarm is a couple beeps and then silent, so if you actually use the clock as a time you're going to miss your cook times unless you're actively cookingIt cooks well though, and the power and effectiveness of warming is there, so it gets a few stars for that but otherwise this is a unit I could only recommend as a filler unit and not going to be a good kitchen companion."
1,This microwave over heats all the time. Anything over 3 minutes and it shuts off. Then you have to wait 5 minutes (or more) for it to cool down to finish use.
4,"It's a good microwave that does the job no real bells and whistles not that I expected any, the microwave looks really nice and fits my decor I've cooked standard microwave stuff that we all microwave from time to time and it works out fine. It's a quiet and efficient tool in the kitchen.Four stars to the microwave I would buy it again."
5,This is an awesome product I'm so happy that I purchased this it is easy to work heats up extremely hot which I love also easy dial buttons also to change temperatures it was just a great great purchase I love this product
5,"First one had broken glass, but the quickly send me a replacement to trade. New one was perfect. Read the manual before you use it"
2,"Walked into kitchen and found my Farberware FMWO13AHTBKE microwave running but no one had turned it . This happened once before and I should have thrown it out then for safety.  I tried to use it-- it seemed to be running because the light was on and the plate turned, but the timer did not count down and the food was not heated at all.Also, the clear plastic over the number pad had wrinkled up.  Owned the microwave for two years and nine months."
5,great replacement 👏
3,"I ordered the small countertop microwave for a small shelf in the kitchen.  The depth of this microwave says 15.9 on the side and even on the box.  It is not!  it is about 12.9.  It is very tiny for the shelf.  If they are counting the door handle in the dimension of the depth, they should not."
5,"After many hours searching through hundreds of counter top microwave's, I finally found this Toshiba EM925A5A-BS. We've had it for about 2 weeks now and use it 10 -20 times per day. The biggest feature I looked for was a way to turn off the d**n beeps that seem to be very much the only way they come on almost all other brands / models. There are a couple in the mega sized / $ 300 + range, but our microwave cooking habits as well as counter space size dictated a smaller unit at a more reasonable price. Finally stumbled across this one, with Toshiba even providing a comparison chart that showed this model actually allows you to easily and semi permanently disable ALL beeps (even button pressing beeps) with a single button push (hold down the # 8 key for 5 seconds and that's it!). What a joy not to have to stand by the microwave to catch it before finishing anymore. Yes, I am a bit a-d-d on all the alert beeping, alarm dinging, horn blaring noise pollution we are made to endure in this high tech age. Finally, a mfg noticed that there are a lot of us (try searching the internet or even just Amazon reviews for quiet, beep less, mutable, etc. microwaves and see how many are looking for this) that hate the 5 beeps which we must endure countless times a day. All other features of this guy are fine. 1 button push for 30 sec, and 1 - 6 minutes + some preset popcorn, beverage, etc buttons that we never use. No, it will not cook your Thanksgiving turkey or smoke a side of brisket, it is great for popcorn, baking potatoes, pre-cooking poultry pieces, vege plate, etc. basically anything that fits on a ~ 12"" diameter plastic plate and isn't too tall. Attractive looking with a nice interior light and a sleek black silver exterior. Thank you Toshiba for coming up with beep controllable model this at such a reasonable price. Curious why all your higher end models don't also have this feature, but so glad you made it available on this one. Now, if I can only find a rice cooker that doesn't beep 12 times when the rice is done ........."
2,Product is totally wet inside with condensation after use
4,"I have to leave the door open for an hour or so to get rid of the steam that builds up (so thick you can't see what is cooking), which for some reason does not have a regular way to escape and it has at least 8 inches clearance on every side.  Also you can't set time-cook while the timer is on. When I attempted to contact someone for help, they made fun of me."
4,"No issues, except it sits a little unlevel with no means of adjusting the foot pads."
4,Super cute! I think this is the most perfect little microwave and it's a good price. It's missing some of the functions you might expect on a larger more expensive microwave. It's not a deal breaker for me at all.
3,It's a good product it's just too loud.
3,fills with smoke when i use
3,I like the inside is not white. and that it is small
1,"This is the SECOND one of these that I got. The first one was bad straight out of the box. The tech on the phone asked me to turn it on so he could hear the noise it was making, and IMMEDIATELY told me to shut it off.He said the Magnetic Resonator was bad.They had me purchase a new one, and I was told I would get a full refund.I got the refund, but it was minus a $25.00 restocking fee. When I called them back about the discrepancy in the price they said they were sorry but it is a normal charge any time something is returned.Now I have had this one about 3 months and when I was heating up a cup of water for my coffee it started smoking.It now is making a loud noise like a bearing is out in the turntable.It still heats just fine, but the turntable is screaming and grinding.I am getting ready to call them again.I would NOT recommend this brandI had a EMERSON microwave for 32 years before it went out, but I could not afford that brand right now with the Covid-19 and lack of funds, so I got this instead. MY BAD"
2,Positives : arrived on time. good size.Negatives: Hot spot in the microwave that burns anything near it.Poor buttons layout and No one minute button or 30-second button.
5,It works well and fits in my small space.
4,"Amazon gave me no alert on my phone or email when delivered on Sat. This is the second Toshiba micro-conv oven I have bought. Interior stainless stains quickly, cant be cleaned. Has some backwards operating keys, the stop stop and start buttons are reversed from what most micros have. It is mounted in a Kenworth with a big sleeper, so it has seen a lot of hard bumpy roads. The light started to fail after a year, on and off, mostly off. I still bought another one because after I did the research again, It is the best one. I had a Sharp Grill #2 conv- micro before, and this is much better. Have had this one for 1 1/2 years."
1,"Purchased a ""damaged"" microwave oven that was described as ""package damaged with some scratches on sides and back"". Would not mind the scratches on sides and back since we were going to install into a cabinet anyway. However, the damage was so bad that the door was ajar and would not close properly, which could lead to a safety hazard. Returning the item."
2,"I would avoid this brand of microwave, it died within 9 months, piece of crap."
3,"This microwave is loud.  The door seems to be off a little, like it's not closing properly.  Not sure what to do"
4,"Great looking, sturdy, and a perfect size for my basement kitchenette. However it's not very powerful (which I somewhat expected) and the preset cooking times are not accurate -- everything takes longer."
2,"If all you need to do is put the number of minutes in and hit start, look no further...If you're looking for a Microwave that will tackle any task the second you walk up to the display, look elsewhere..In order to use the 1-8 Sensor cooking features, you will need to memorize the 8 settings or do what I did, laminate the sensor programming guide and tape it inside of a cabinet...  On my old Panasonic Micro you could hit the Sensor button and the disply would say things like ""FISH, MEAT, CHICK, POTAT, SOUP"" but not this sucker, it's ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc""..."
3,"The 7,8,9 buttons don't work"
3,"The microwave works well, but the buttons are not illuminated. Even in a well-lit kitchen, it is hard to see the controls. The only thing that is lighted is the clock."
5,Has been a very good purchase!
4,"I gave this 4 stars because it's decent for its intended purpose. We specifically wanted something very small for a tight space. You give up a lot of power to get such a small microwave, but it's to be expected.So if you're buying this hoping it will perform like a bigger microwave you'll be incredibly disappointed.  But if you need something small, it's decent."
1,"Hello all,I’m certain the ML-EM34P(SS) Smart countertop microwave oven may have its good points.  I like the fact it is made of stainless steel, that is nice!  This Smart Home App must be used to connect this particular microwave to the internet!  Amazon disabilities couldn’t help us with the app!  They said essentially call back when the oven is connected to the internet.  My wife and I tried two services!  Aira couldn’t help us either!  We ended up with Apple Accessibility!  The man there could connect to my screen and watch what I was doing!  A verification code was needed.  We found out on the second try, we had five minutes to figure out what it was and type it in where it is suppose to go.  We did this four times before we finally got it put in!  Connecting to the internet was even more frustrating!  The Apple Rep wasn’t certain the oven was connected!  I think we worked with it for at least three hours!  My wife called Aira to see if they could read the screen for her!  They helped her find the minute and thirty second buttons so we could have breakfast bowls.  She cooked both of them at the same time!  The motor is very quiet!  The breakfast bowls turned out quite well!  Amazon disability told us there wasn’t an overlay available for this oven!  We are indeed very disappointed that we have to send it back with all the frustrations of sending this heavy oven back!  We’ve had the magic Sheff ovens and both of them lasted two to three years!  Two hundred twenty dollars is too much to pay for this frustration we’ve been through!  We can find a good oven locally for around $80 or so and mark it with help from others and get the same amount of time for less money!  This oven is best for sighted persons who want a novalty product in their kitchen or maybe they want the latest and greatest of everything!  It may be fine after sett up but we say enough is enough!  We ordered Amazon so we wouldn’t be out in the ice and cold!  We like talking microwaves when they work or are easy to set up and the cost is reasonable!JimJim r"
3,"Love the exterior looks.  The led is great - Really bright! But it’s not super easy to navigate and I have never had more trouble setting  a microwave oven clock , in my life! At my age, I’ve experienced quite a few microwaves and the clock on this one is a first! Entirely too difficult, goes against everything you thought you knew about setting a clock on a microwave and for the life of me, I don’t understand why Toshiba did it this way. I’m not recommending it solely on the clock. It sucks. It’s ridiculous and makes no sense."
1,The microwave stopped working. It doesn't work no more. I need to return it. I will order another one.
3,Don’t heat quick
1,This is the second one replacing the first because it sounds like popcorn popping.  Exact noise as the first.  Going to return for a different brand.  Very slow to heat.
3,The only drawback is no handle on it. Hard to open and shuts loudly.
5,The microwave works great and I've had no issues with it. But it is louder than other microwaves I've had. Not a big deal for me and I hardly notice it after using it awhile.
5,"Right size, quiet, just what I needed."
5,"Love this look and function. This is great in a small space, but gives a big punch. I love to sleep design, and the ease of use. It looks very high end."
3,Do not bother buying this one. It started throwing sparks in the casing of the unit after one year. Not a happy camper with this brand.
1,"Horrible experience with this microwave, despite so many positive reviews!  Should have listened to the reviews that listed the problems they were having.  After 2 months, the microwave would not heat properly at times.  The light and the turn table spins when cooking, but the food was literally stone cold.  Then, the microwave would time-out at times.  After setting the cooking time, it would sound a continuous beep and the screen (showing the time setting) went black -- could not clear the error by hitting stop, had to unplug the oven and wait a few minutes and plug it back on to clear the error.  Noticeable wear on the number pads as others have commented.  Definitely NOT recommended, and sorely regret this purchase!"
3,"I ordered this microwave when my previous microwave gave out after 6 years of use. This microwave was cheap but when I received it, I realized why. It was my mistake not to double check that it would be big enough, but the power in this thing sucks. I have it set to the highest power setting there is for this model, and it still takes at least double the amount of time to cook something like a Hot Pocket.If you are a college student and just need a small microwave for your dorm room, this would be fine, but for a family who uses a microwave often, this is too small and not nearly powerful enough."
3,"It is not easy to use, too difficult figuring out how to start it. Have to repeatedly push buttons to get it running, even when it seems I have followed the directions. Too many options. I generally just want to defrost items or heat up leftovers. My husband has used to popcorn setting. I was looking for white, but this one does look nice and fits well in the space I have."
1,"The media could not be loaded.Where to begin...We purchased this microwave in April of 2020.  Conveniently, all of its issues began the day after the Amazon return window closed.  Currently, I am researching the manufacturer's warranty.  Basically, any time my wife and I microwave certain foods (seems to be vegetables) they burst into flames! You will hear a low electrical hum coming then BAM, your vegetables are a flaming inferno on the plate inside.  Occasionally when you close the door on the microwave, it'll make this loud continuous beep for about 20-30 seconds and then will not work until you unplug and reset it.  It's most recent issue is now when you put food in it to heat up for say 2 minutes and it turns on and runs the full 2 minutes, however the microwave motor never engaged and the food comes out as cold as it went in.This thing is full of electrical issues and I may just have a lemon, but I want this thing replaced by Farberware before it explodes.  Buyer beware!"
2,"I ordered my microwave as a gift to my sisters new house , but microwave got lost so I bought another one at Costco . 3 weeks later the micro game appeared at my door . Returned the microwave from Costco . Now that we are using this microwave, we realized that there is a long beep noise after and before you use it . It’s quite annoying especially if you are using the microwave early a.m or late at night while everyone else is sleeping . Is it that my microwave is defective ? Or is there some here on the settings where I can fix this issue ?"
4,"So we got this one to replace the last combination microwave. I loved the baking function since I did not need to use the big oven and heat up the kitchen in the summer. I’ve tried w this one but although my cornbread looked beautiful on the outside, it was anything but done on the inside! Maybe I did something wrong? I’ll try a box cake next they always came out perfect w the old combo microwave.It has a lot of power to microwave I noticed. Seems to reheat in less time. Air fried several pieces of pizza and came out like fresh pizza just like the Airfryer we also have. We have not tried the other functions so far. Easy to clean just wipe w damp cloth. Happy so far just hoping the baking function works out which was the main reason we chose this appliance"
2,"I liked the price of this and have used it for just barely a year. I bought it on October 1, 2018 from Amazon and now it's October 2, 2019. I didn't use it over the summer because I'm a teacher and it's in my classroom. Just last week it started to spark? I say spark because I'm not sure how to describe it. The light flickers while it's running and then after I open the door. I think it's still heating properly but it might have cooled down a little bit. The buttons are easy to use but the ones I use frequently are starting to bubble. Maybe consider another microwave unless you only want to use it for less than a year."
5,"Really, Really, Powerful Compact Unit! (And, USPS delivered by dropping uphill tumbling unit until gravel was imbedded through delivered box; Yet, this sturdy unit ""Rocks-On"" it's purpose!Two gripes:#1 Panel touch requires too much force which moves/shoves the unit backward.#2 Tray w/spinner beneath don't work together; as mismatched, poorly fitted."
2,"This works and that's about it.  I bought it because it fits the space and my Sharp wore out after 2 million uses...and they don't make that model any longer :(  This heats but is a crappy machine, a million functions but hard to use, figure out and NOT NECESSARY, just need it to reheat & heat food, oh and did I mention how loud it is?  Just and added perk... NOT!  Buy a  SHARP or TOSHIBA and get better quality, might cost more but it's worth it!!!"
1,"I dont understand.. This is the second time I get it delivered, Fist time came all broken, even with trash in the box. I return it and I just received a ""new one today ""  and it is also damaged.  What a waste of money . I will definitely not buy it again..."
5,fit perfectly into my appliance garage
5,"It works wonderful and love the fact that it came right to my doorstep, I didn't have to bother with going to a store to pick it up. I also like that I can enter in 10 seconds if I want, unlike on some other microwaves where the least amount of time you can do is 30 seconds."
5,"I've been using the Panasonic Microwave Oven for a few months now, and I'm really impressed with it. It's got a strong 1200 watt power output, which means it heats food quickly and evenly. The interface is also very easy to use, with clear buttons and a large display. I especially like the Genius Sensor feature, which automatically adjusts the cooking time based on the weight of the food.Another thing I really like about this microwave is the slick design. It's black with a stainless steel finish, and it looks great on my countertop. The interior is also very spacious, so I can easily fit a large plate of food inside.Overall, I'm really happy with the Panasonic Microwave Oven. It's powerful, easy to use, and looks great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new microwave.Here are some of the pros and cons of the Panasonic Microwave Oven:Pros:- Powerful 1200 watt power output- Easy to use interface- Genius Sensor feature- Slick design- Spacious interiorCons:- NoneOverall, I think the Panasonic Microwave Oven is a great choice for anyone looking for a powerful and easy-to-use microwave. It's got a sleek design and a spacious interior, and the Genius Sensor feature is really helpful for automatically adjusting the cooking time. If you're looking for a new microwave, I would definitely recommend checking out the Panasonic Microwave Oven."
1,MIcrowave came with box destroyed and crayon marks covering inside of the box. Food stuck on the rotating tray and greasy fingerprins all over it! The back of the microwave is caved in and numerous dents on front and sides. The door..
4,"It is okay, but the little plate you have to put your food sucks, you have to fight a little bit to get in just right sometimes, if you can afford it get one without that stupid plate."
4,This is the most powerful microwave I have ever used.  It has one of the biggest internal dimensions I have ever encountered which was the primary reason I purchased this model.  The only complaint I have so far is that it has too many buttons.  This microwave will boil a gallon of microwave in 5-7 min.
1,"Box was fairly destroyed, the packing materials pretty much disintegrated, the microwave itself ""looked"" in good condition, but the microwave didn't even work.  Tried different modes, nothing.  Be very cautious when buying something from this seller."
5,"This is one of the only microwave ovens we could find that really suited a white kitchen.  Most other stainless steel models have black accents.  In addition, we had a very specific size that would fit into our remodel and one fit the space perfectly.  On top of that, even though the rated water is lower than our old, wall mount Samsung microwave, this seems to heat up leftovers and cups of water for tea, just as fast, plus it's quieter while running.  Let hope it lasts."
3,"for the price its fine, but very noisy. I think the insulation is poor, but it works like anyother of  this price range. Just ok, nothing special"
4,"It takes 4 steps to heat food.Choose time, power,change power and start.  The buttons need to be pressed hard in order for options to be set."
2,For some reason after 2 years the surface inside especially under the glass plater has started to chip. Not sure if I used diluted bleach and I shouldn’t have to clean it but bummed that it started to chip. Not sure but will have to buy a new one. I guess warm water vinegar and maybe lemon would’ve sufficed. Still works but just didn’t hold up well inside with blemishes and coating isn’t smooth.
1,"Pros: Love the looks, like the handle instead of a button, the unit basically works.Cons: The (humidity) sensor is useless.  A large cup of water starts boiling, or a plate of speghetti splatters all over, before it shuts off.The kitchen timer works once for each time the unit is plugged in.  After that it makes no sound when it times out.The door has a 1mm gap at the top, 0.25mm gap at the bottom.  Customer service said that's still safe.The cover of the plug comes off when you pull on it to un-plug the microwave ie to reboot the Kitchen timer.The cook time button is the same as the clock set button.  Press it once to set the clock (twice a year), press it twice to set cook time (multiple times per day).  The SW engineer was working on the Alexa functions instead of paying attention to basics.I'd return it except my wife doesn't care about the Sensor or kitchen timer.Update: after nine months of use, the inside window can not be cleaned.  Looks like it's been used in a fraternity.Update 2: can't start cooking when the timer is running. The combined  set clock/cook time button irritates me almost daily."
1,"UPDATE 7/23:  Microwave died, with H97 error code (magnetron/wiring/control board/....).POOR QUALITY.AVOID.After our 6 year old 1250W 2.2 cubic ft Panasonic NN-H965BF microwave started making clunking noises & was popping breakers, I figured it was time to replace it.In checking online, there are not a large number of reasonably priced 1250W 2.2 CuFt microwaves out there.Sooooo.....I went with another Panasonic unit.I just received it an hour or two ago, and tested it with a quart of water.It heats stuff up.....Go Figure!Luckily, it doesn't pop breakers like our older microwave did.I'm SMACKING the rating to 2 stars due to Panasonic's apparently deceptive labeling as to power requirements on this microwave.The label (see picture) claims ""Input 12.3 amps"", which would suggest that it would be happy on a 15 amp breaker (despite the owner's manual recommendations for a 20A circuit).You had better be running a 20A or 30A circuit.I tested it two ways:1) With a Kill A Watt P3 (available here on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/P3-P4400-Electricity-Usage-Monitor/dp/B00009MDBU ).  The Kill A Watt is a GREAT device....it measures voltage, frequency, and power consumption (in watts) for a 110V device plugged into the outlet.  Very nice for folks trying to plan on power requirements needed by a backup generator.2) With a ""Clamp"" meter.  I used the Elekcity MSR-C600 that I got from Amazon ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NWGZ4XC ).  It uses a ""clamp"" placed around ONE of the wires feeding an electrical device to tell you its current load in amps.The Kill A Watt showed a 1989 watt consumption.  1989 watts divided by 120 volts = 16.58 Amps.  REMEMBER....Panasonic claims 12.3 Amps.The Etekcity clamp meter showed a current load of 16.87 Amps.  REMEMBER....Panasonic claims 12.3 Amps.This microwave oven works (so far).  I'm disappointed by its misleading power requirement labeling."
2,"One of the reasons I chose Toshiba was because it has the option of turning off the beeping noises that all microwaves make. I purchased this item, and the muting function did not work out of the box, and Toshiba technical support wasn’t able to resolve this. I returned the first purchase of this item that I made, and then ordered the same item, thinking that the first product was defective, but the muting function of the second one also didn’t work. So it seems that this is simply false advertising with regard to the muting function."
4,Bought for my apartment and used for several years.  Gave it to my niece and now she is using it.
1,Way to small for  me
2,"I'm giving it two stars because, frankly, it heats food very, very well, and is easy to use.  BUT IT WILL KILL YOUR WIFI.I've had many microwaves in my life and unlike many others, I do not believe that they give you cancer or that wind turbines cause migraines.  But this microwave, undoubtedly, killed my wifi for *months* before I figured it out.  It didn't just interrupt it while it was running, it would overwhelm devices so badly they'd freeze or drop off the network entirely and wait to be rebooted.  Consistently it fried my router over and over to the point that I would have to hard-boot it to get it back to life.  I even replaced the router thinking that IT had the problem.Look, it makes great food.  The defrosting is ok, not great, always more powerful than I needed.  Reheat works awesome.  But I like my fritter with a side of Facebook, Italian with a side of Instagram, and my pizza rolls with a side of porn.  This setup does not support that in any way, shape, or form.So if you are the tech guru in your family and do not want to enter into a two-month-long argument with your spouse that always starts out like, ""Why is the INTERNET out, Todd?""  ""I don't KNOW, Margo!"", I would 100% recommend against this particular appliance.  For your sake, and everyone else."
4,"Nice microwave, easy to use but only 700 watts of cooking power so it takes some getting used to after coming from an 1100 watt microwave oven."
1,"Update: Recording the noise for the mfd., and poof, a huge cloud of grey, noxious smelling smoke. I had to open windows and doors to clear from my home. Only six months old. It had been making a terrible noise off and on for months, like rocks in a tumbler. I had re-seated the glass plate a million times, pulled further away from wall, and put cushioning supports under all legs. SAME issue. Sorry I didn't read the the one-star review. Looks like other people have had it catch fire. Black and Decker did refund my money, which I appreciate."
2,"After 6 months of moderate use, it died. Was kept clean and plenty of ventilation."
4,Product is great so far. You can't even hear the microwave working. The only issue I had is it was delivered to the wrong place.
1,"I've had two of these in two months.  The FIRST one that I ordered came double boxed and the box was not damaged.  After I wrestled the microwave out of the packaging, I found that the microwave had a large dent on the top edge.  Obviously, the microwave was damaged BEFORE packaging.  I'm a senior citizen with arthritis and could not physically return it.  I made a couple of calls to Amazon to obtain a label for Fedex to pick it up.I agreed to a replacement instead of a refund.  I received it less than two months ago and yesterday (Thanksgiving) it stopped working while heating up items for our big family dinner.  The outside metal case got very hot and white smoke came out.  Scary!"
4,"This has been a great microwave so far. I like the settings for defrost, makes it easy to pick either weight or time you want. My only complaint is that it was smaller on the inside than we anticipated. I know the measurements are on here but it's hard to conceptualize that until you get it. I fits a dinner plate size but not a rectangle casserole dish, as our old one did fit that."
2,Malfunctioned after 5 weeks. However I received a full refund. So gave it a 2 star.
1,Microwave had a big dent in the top when it arrived
2,Paint is damaged in top
5,"I wanted a smaller microwave but didn't want to sacrifice power.  This is a nice unit, and makes my kitchen counter look sleeker and more wide open.  My only complaint is that when you open/close the door it's really loud.  For the money and the name, you'd think they could do a little better on that front."
5,Just what I expected and wanted. Works great and as perfect size for the place it was to go. Would buy again if ever I needed to. I would also recommend the microwave to anyone. I was very pleased.
5,"This microwave is wonderful!! Works great,cooks great.Easy to clean,fairly quiet.Interior is very large!! I can fit larger containers in.It's quite heavy,so you might need help moving it to its chosen spot.I like that it is heavier than my old microwaves.It will stay put and I won't worry about it being nudged and sliding.Easy to set up...took like one minute to figure out the way to use it.( I misplaced the manual right off the bat)Good looking as well.Very happy with it so far!!"
1,"It lived juuuust long enough to not be able to return it when it died. When it did ""work"" It took forever to heat anything, but I assumed that was just because it was low wattage or something, but considering how long it lasted it was probably garbage from the beginning."
5,Love this. Very quiet and energy efficient. Fight in my RV no problem and works great. Door closes so nicely. Definitely recommend.
5,The product was true to size.
1,"This is the highest-rated microwave on Amazon. It sounds great in the description. However, it was difficult to program simple cooking time without double-tapping a button, which was frustrating to hit just right. No beverage setting. The microwave completely died after only five months, on New Year's Eve. We're still trying to get a replacement or refund from Toshiba. The process is unreasonably difficult and can only be done by email. I absolutely do not recommend this product.***A month later and we're still waiting for Toshiba to reimburse us for this faulty five-month-old microwave, a ""top seller."" Buyer beware this model and unresponsive ""customer service."""
1,The rotating device for this has malfunctioned since the third week I’ve had it. Do not recommend.
5,"Works great and heats up dishes uniformly.  Another plus is that it is very quiet.  One of the other things that bothered me with my Cuisinart (my last microwave, is that the lighting inside was not adequate for me to see where the cooking was at.  This Panasonic has great lighting and everything is visible.  Very easy to clean.  I am really pleased with my purchase!"
1,"Update 11/17/22: I had to reduce my review to one star. While I very much enjoyed using this oven, it quit working suddenly and started showing PF on the display; after that, it only worked sporadically, and the dispaly never came back on. None of the troubleshooting tips offered by GE resolved the problem. An appliance repair person came out and looked at it, and said the motherboard needed to be replaced. The cost of that replacement was more than the current price of the unit.I had hoped that choosing GE would mean a more reliable unit, but this lasted just over 6 months in a home that we spend a good deal of time away from (so by no means did it get daily use). I'm really disappointed with it. I won't be choosing another GE microwave.Original reviews:Update: I've had this unit for a month or so, and I'm even happier with it now that I've figured it out. I have only used my oven once since I've had it, and haven't had to take my air fryer out at all (fries are great in this!). In the picture, I cooked the drumsticks from a semi-frozen state (forgot to defrost the night before🤦🏼‍♀️) using the convection/microwave combo on the included tray, and they came out lovely in just under 20 minutes! That setting is my new favorite--food gets cooked inside quickly from the microwave, but crispy and brown from the convection oven part. It's perfect when cooking for two. The broiler works great on French bread, as well. I would absolutely give it 5 stars, but the manual is still lacking.Original review: I'm really happy with this microwave overall. I ordered it to replace a more powerful but much larger machine that was eating up too much counter space. It's much smaller and less obtrusive (that's relative, of course, but it's not as tall as others I've had, so it looks less bulky). I wasn't expecting it to be so quiet, but I love it! I had no idea how noisy microwaves were until I got this one, which is almost silent while running.The machine functions as it should. It performs as expected for the power (my previous one was 1250 w, and I can tell a difference, but it's minor and I mostly only use it for heating drinks and steaming veggies, so nbd). The air fryer works well. I used the pan and tall rack for cooking 6 fresh chicken wings and they were done in less than 22 minutes (I used the automatic setting for the amount I was cooking per the guide, but they were done sooner by my thermometer). They weren't super crispy, but good enough for my husband. I also did a couple of potstickers in it and they did great. Hopefully I'll be able to shelve my small air fryer,  freeing up  some storage space, and use this instead. I haven't used the convection feature yet, but have no reason to believe it won't work since the technology of the air fryer is effective.The inside is stainless-looking metal, so it's a little harder to clean than the other one I had. There are a lot of great pre-programmed features, and the popcorn button works well (no burned kernels).My only criticism is that the accompanying literature doesn't help much. The page that shows how to use the air fryer is great, but there are no details about the convection oven. There are a short rack and a tall rack included (as well as the air-fry pan), but no instructions for what to do with the short rack. I need a manual with more info than caution and troubleshooting because I don't have the patience to figure it all out by pressing buttons until I get there (and some buttons mudt be pushed multiple times, while some need to be pressed in order, and that takes awhile to master).If the manual were better, I'd give this 5 stars. I still really like it, especially because it's SO quiet. The stainless looks good, as well."
5,"Light weight, good looking, best Performance"
4,"I had an air fryer that met its demise. Prior to that I was planning on purchasing a microwave convection oven. When I came across this model I was hopeful that it would be able to do all that I needed. Unfortunately, the air fryer takes as long to cook as my standard oven. For example: with my late air fryer I could cook seasoned tater tots in 12 minutes at 400°.  That is a little quicker than the standard air fryer cook time per instructions on the bag and preprogrammed time on the airfryer. This unit takes 20+ minutes at 425°."
3,"The front control panel is not lit. Very difficult to use. Adding light to the panel, and simplified instructions would be a great help."
1,NO users Manual!!! Very heavy and difficult to re pack. A convection Microwave Is relatively USLESS without a users Manual!
4,This was a replacement for another one that burned up the previous year.  It is the only microwave thatfits into the slot in my kitchen.  It is a bit tricky to use in that the sometimes words come on thescreen and you have to open the door to get rid of them.  I hope this one lasts better.  It was undercontract and I am still waiting to get the replacement cost from GE.
1,Does not work frequently. Shuts off. Doesn’t heat up the food. And it’s not even 6 months old. I’d give it zero stars if I could.
1,"This was the first time I was disappointed in a order I place a order for a medium size microwave I got this toy one , that ok I gave it  to someone in need !"
2,The microwave leaks microwaves badly.  Peg the meter I used to test it with.
4,"I bought this tiny microwave to augment a large commercial grade oven that proved too powerful and complex for family use. The only reason this oven rated four stars rather than five is that it is so small and lightweight that it needs to be held down while opening the door to avoid spilling. During a week of hard use by my kids, this oven proved itself a handy mother's-helper. It easily reheats plates of leftovers and beverages with preset buttons. It fits nicely on our snack counter, taking about the space of a toaster oven. I wouldn't choose this oven for heavy cooking, but it's great for dorms, offices, and simple warming tasks.2019 Followup: This little powerhouse is still earning its keep in our kitchen. The family uses it about 5 times per day. It hasn't disappointed us yet. I'd now rate it 4.5 stars, if that were an option. It's lightness is the only drawback."
4,Easy to use.
2,"Only got a little over 2 years out of it. Not sure if that’s the norm?  I may order again but if we do not get more time out of the next one, I’m done."
4,Didn't receive a manual.  Can't set clock??
2,"This wave always acted weird and its been getting worse.  First it didnt put a light on when you opened it just when you were cooking but now 3 years later it does come on when the door is open.  The we noticed that after you cook and want to put it back in for more time, you always had to push stop, get a long beep, and then it would let you use it again.  And now if you try to lower the power it will run your entered time, but when its done it wont shut off, it will instead give you a double beep, reset the time to when you entered, and keep going another cycle on full blast.This is the third Nordicware rice cooker its melted, and the most sever.  Luckily, each time it has done something dumb we caught it before the food, or bowl, has caught fire.  This last rice cooker was bad enough to smoke the whole house up.This was also the last straw, it will be coming to the range with me the next time i go and its going be ventilated with extreme predjudice."
2,"This was the cheapest microwave that didn't look too sketchy, and at first it heated food as expected. A month later and it no longer heats things well. I put a 7 oz frozen pizza in, which usually took 3-4 minutes in this or other microwaves, and now after 10 minutes the cheese isn't even melted. So it still kinda heats stuff but even fiddling with power settings it's like it's stuck on defrost mode."
3,"works just fine. Like having a handle instead of a push button to open the door. controls are easy to use & read. interior is easy to clean.  The only down fall is the NOISE, it is very loud when running."
5,Works well for me.
2,Don’t buy this! The Cook time/Clock  is BACKWARDS. When you press the Cook time/clock..it wants you to set the Clock every single time…so you have to bypass the Clock Set every time you microwave something.  Very frustrating!
4,"This is a great microwave, but I was hoping there would be more options in the App or the ability to add/edit custom functions.So far I've never used the Alexa integration. Maybe if it gave me a reminder when it was done?The kitchen timer doesn't beep when it's done so that's not any use either.The only real issue was that initially after Daylight savings time ended in the fall, the clock was always off by an hour even after manually changing the time. Today I found that there is a new firmware update to fix this issueThe newest firmware is V.06.22_0000. Open MSmarthome and go to settings > Update device firmware. There you can set it to automatically update or manually update it once. This will fix the time without any other steps.Edit: The time didn't change automatically when daylight saving time started in the spring but I was able to manually change the time ahead one hour and it stuck."
1,Bought this the first week of October. This microwave hasn’t lasted us 3 months before having issues. The push button on the door does nothing. You have to pry the door open in order to use the microwave. JUNK! Now having to deal with customer service through GE to get it fixed since it is one month out of the Amazon return window. Really disappointed with this product.
3,The numbers on the clock aren't easy to read. The microwave works well
1,"Just received this microwave model EM925A5A-SS ordered from Amazon. I needed a small MW because of my small kitchen. The size parameters listed were 11.48""D x 19.15""W x 15.91""H. To my dismay the ""D"" and ""H"" dimensions were swapped. The depth was in reality 15.91"" and the Height was 11.48"". Consequently, my MW sticks out over my counter. If the depth was 11.48"" as advertised it would have fit perfectly. Hopefully, the V will have no additional issues"
3,No sirve no calienta nada
5,Great size. Easy to use. Easy to open and clean. Buttons easy to see and use.
1,"There may be a ""trick"" to using it.  It burnt the bottom of the few frozen brussels sprouts I tried to cook.  Smokecame out of the door as I opened it.Nothing is automatic.  When you use it you have to click stop twice before it will return to the time of day.  It will show the length of time you used last.It makes odd noixes as it is being used.  Sometimes it sounds like cracking plates.  These are micro-safe that Iam using.Why I didn't send it back when I had the chance I will never understand."
4,"This was a gift to my sister, and she told me it was easy to used and the right size"
2,"Good while it lasted, but three years later it started weirdly turning on by itself when the door was opened. Had to unplug it when not in use. Have to throw it away now — safety hazard."
4,Works great
1,"Box was ripped, bar codes etc were cut out and resent. Worst shipment from amazon so far in my many years using the service. Amazon just overpacked without any quality controls with this vendor shipment.Product worked on first try. Time will tell how long it'll last."
4,"It is a fine value.  It has held up to 2 years of dorm life for our girl.  That is a serious accomplishment for a small microwave.  Defiantly a lower end model, but for the price you cannot expect more than what it delivers."
5,"Very satisfied with the microwave.  Doesn't take much longer to cook/heat food than the bigger one it replaced. For instance, a cup of tea takes about 1:40 as opposed to 1:20 for the old one.  Also, takes up less space on my counter.  Does what I need it to do very well."
4,"I was confused after reading the mixed reviews but ordered it anyway. Its been a few weeks now and is running good. It heats well in less time, only drawback is the noise at heating time. It's a bit louder than what I used earlier. The size is neither too big nor too small, fits perfect in my kitchen shelf corner."
4,"I love this microwave. Perfect size for me and has all the standard features. Has a standard plug, but it's huge. Unsure why. I've connected it to Alexa, but find it quicker to just push the buttons. Great purchase."
2,The microwave function has huge dead zones in the middle.  Just about everything comes out half scalding and half frozen still.  When doing pizzas the outside will be over cooked and the cheese in the middle will still have frost on it.  The only thing can heat evenly is liquids.
4,Key pad is tough to use in low light. Can’t see the controls because they are not self lit. Good for hearing water for a cup of tea; reheating food; basic use.
3,11 months after it stopped working... almost like a planned obsolescence...
4,"It was exactly as listed.  Flexible so I can experiment with foods, times, and temperature"
5,Very practical and work wonderfully.
5,We have always wanted an air fryer so to have a microwave oven with convection oven and air fryer all in one product was a no brainer. I love all the features on it. You have to download the instructional booklet.
3,"First off, it's very large, and requires a specific amount of space on all sides. This is good and bad, good because it's very deep and can accommodate most large meals, or family size frozen dinners. Bad because, well, it takes up a lot of space, and gets hot in certain areas.  The worst thing about it is the keyboard, tiny font, no backlight, and is very difficult to see what you're doing unless it's directly lit, that part is aggravating! The way the door opens and closes without a soft method, like a button on the handle, or on the front, is really getting irritating because it's a HARD close, every time. For a microwave with a feature that quiets the end of session timer, it's loud as hell to shut, very weird. It cooks extremely well though, and I do like how a cup handle returns to where you put it when you warm coffee, or something hot. I fit had a backlight, or doubled the font used on the only way to interact with it, I'd give it 4 stars, it really is incredibly annoying, and that's unfortunate for something that does it's job so well."
2,"Loved the color. Loved the easy of use. Is a bit loud. Which is okay. What is not okay is that 2 years of normal use by a family of four, the interior ceiling of the microwave is burnt and peeling off. Don't trust it anymore. Having to replace it. Really, really sucks. Our previous microwave (from a different brand) stuck around with us so long, the once white plastic had yellowed with age. Had expected more from Farberware."
1,"I would not recommend this even it itvwere the only microwave on the market. I received the first one and the light in it was very dim and kept flickering. I get the second, replacement, and it comes on automatically when it’s plugged in or the door is shut. It gets plugged in and the light comes on, the plate inside starts turning, and the fan is running. It will not allow you to put in a time or command to cook making it completely useless."
4,The color was not exactly retro red but other than that the microwave works well.  Adds nice touch to our fifties diner apartment kitchen.
2,"Like everyone else, the echo integration fails after a few days with the response, ""hm. Microwave oven is not responding."" I called Toshiba. They escalated a support ticket. It's been weeks, and I have yet to hear from that department."
4,very good quality with unconventional controls. no number pad.  can’t add time after starting except in 30 sec increments.  probably too many dedicated buttons.
1,"This microwave is inconsistent.  It will either over heat or underheat your food seemingly at random.  Do not ever try to defrost meat in this microwave.  First glance this looks like a nice microwave.  The first few times I used it it seemed very powerful.  Well then I tried to defrost some ground beef, I converted the Lbs to Oz as is required to ""defrost by weight"" .  It made a beep halfway through the defrosting process and kept going.  So I stopped it and fliped the meat over as is standard for most microwaves.  When microwave beeped 5 times(annoying) to indicate it was done I pulled the ground beef out to discover almost all of the beef had been cooked.  I have never had that happen on any of the 50+ microwaves I have used.  So a pound and a half of ground beef in the garage.  Then I tried to defrost some chicken breasts and did the conversation to Oz from lbs and then cut back several oz again flipping when it beeped.  Pulled chicken out to see it was also mostly cooked, so a pound and a half of chicken breast in the garbage.  Tried ground beef again and reduced the oz by a 1/2 pound and fliped the meat seven or eight times while defrosting.  I pulled the beef out early and parts of it were hot and some frozen, so I quickly started mixing the meat with my hands so it wouldn't continue to cook to some success as I didn't have to throw all of the beef away this time.This microwave also offers a ""defrost by time"" function, there is no chart, instructions, explanations, exaples or even a guideline in the manual to use this feature, other than that it will defrost for the time you set it to.  Not how long ""x"" might take to defrost.  So tonight I tried that as well, total failure.I called customer service for direction before trying to defrost beef this evening, they had no clue.  They did very kindly do an internet search on how to defrost meat in the microwave and told me suggestions from some cooking websites not affiliated with this microwave in any way.  As I stated before the results were ineatable.So I asked friends and family if I was the only person who uses the microwave to defrost meat, especially during the work week.  Well I am certainly not alone in that category, even though we all agreed it's better to defrost in the fridge if you know the night before what you will be cooking.  Well since I can't plan what my family will want to eat for dinner several nights before.I am thinking this microwave will need to be returned and replaced with a brand that actually works, much less considers what someone may be defrosting and providing their customers with some sort of explanation as to how to successfully accomplish it."
5,"Bought specifically for low wattage, short cooking-periods in an off-grid application and this performs the action very well.The 'so familiar' controls are such, that I didn't need to read the instructions to use.Hope it lasts because it does the job nicely."
1,"failed one year & 10 days , just after the mfg warrenty , I had asurion sooo i got my $ back . it ran funny with a couple months surging power on & off"
2,This microwave getting weaker  in power heating food. It's not 1 year yet I owned this ...dont know if I can depend on this continually using for months..hope so or else I'll get upset 😔
5,"There were some packing concerns.  This shipping box had appeared to have been dropped several times the box has crushed corners and the packing material on the inside of the box was also crushed.  This microware did have a small dent in the door but only cosmetic, I believe.  We chose not to return.  As for the micoware it was what we expected, all the function we expected.  No instruction on the use Air fryer function, however all the functions we wanted are there. Very quite, great appearance.  Earlier in the purchase/ownership process, similar model sold by another manufacturer failed us in three years.  So the we are still in the evaluation phase.  Do note, we ordered the Stainless Steel thinking thee entire exterior and interior would be stainless however only the internal and exterior face of the door was stainless. The exterior cover was Black.  For us this was okay because we installed in a cabinet enclosure.  For those wanting to place on countertop and wanting the exterior to be stainless steel, you may be disappointed with the black cover.  For function features, size and noise level, quite we would recommend."
5,Definitely a keeper! Money well spent💯
4,"This is a 1200 watt microwave. This is about 10% more powerful than the standard 1100 watts used to establish cooking times for all TV dinners, so there is a risk of overcooking. Reducing this oven's power level by one step to ""9"" will bring the oven in concert with TV dinner cook times. This should be made clear to purchasers of this oven. Also, the display is a bit sparse in that it does not display power levels while cooking. The information displayed during cooking is minimally adequate. Otherwise, the oven works very well and is easy to use. The internal cooling fan is a bit loud which some might find annoying. I am well satisfied with this product."
1,"This microwave  has a design flaw. The Turntable keeps becoming dislodged and Sliding all over the interior of the machine.VERY DANGEROUS! I called customer service the representative was absolutely no help. She kept giving me ridiculous things I needed to do like video tape the turntable when it’s coming off the ring and post in the middle.  I had already sent regular pictures of the interior.  I feel she was Deliberately trying to frustrate me so I would go away and give up. I Will never purchase another BLACK & DECKER  product, it’s complete junk!"
2,"Loved everything about this microwave. A little under 2 years of ownership with low to medium use, it caught fire on the inside right side where the electronics are! Now the debate, since all microwaves are made in the same place and just branded different, should I replace with the exact same model?"
4,"This is a decent microwave. It's easy to use. It has all the basic features you'd expect without paying an exorbitant amount.  My only complaint is that it is rather noisy, at least noisier than other microwaves of similar size and power that we've used in the past."
5,Great product
5,"This is an excellent microwave and air-fryer oven combo. Couldn't find the user manual in the box and a few buttons were confusing to begin with. However, after some time playing with it, I grow to enjoy it. Good aesthetics outside and inside. Good safety features. It is a bit larger than I anticipated (I wanted a small unit to fit our small kitchen space), but all the combined features justify it. Is $200 worth what you are getting? I think so. I expect many good years of daily use out of this machine."
5,"We got the 2.2ft refurbished because we were on the hunt for a  new microwave because ours was almost 10 years old & needed to be retired. We also didn’t want to get stuck with a dinky little Walmart special for 80 bucks so… When we saw this one on major sale as a new-used refurbished microwave at half the price…. Or rather, the same price as the 1.1 cubic foot sized microwave, I thought, why not?Well, first off, this bad boy is MASSIVE. Nobody has any business with a microwave this big if you’re not maintaining a sizable restaurant. I’d look at this in a small family home such as my own & wonder just exactly what (or who) they’re putting in that thing.We were struck when we first opened the box. My Pomeranian & Jack Russell mix were all excited about the new thing on the floor & BOTH climbed in like it was their new home - that’s how big it is! Of course we promptly removed them from it before placing it on the counter & plugging it in. No spicy puppy nuggets for us today.But you could probably cook a decent sized Turkey & all the holiday fixings’ in one go inside this thing. Or use it to crawl inside & hide from a burglar if you’re small like me. Well worth the price already & doubles as a home defense safe room.It also cooked nearly twice as fast/hot as our old microwave, which I’m assuming is a standard 1.1 cubic foot size & 900 watts. This thing is a beast, if it actually was used/refurbished, I couldn’t tell because it arrived in perfect condition.We’ve been using it for a month or so now for just about everything & I have no complaints. The lighting is nice (our old one went out years ago so we couldn’t see siht. But with with this you can see inside very clearly. It also has a reminder “ding” If you haven’t opened the door after it finished. I like the many pre-sets but Will say that the popcorn one is too strong for any popcorn we’ve made since buying it, so keep a close eye on it or deal with the wrath of toddlers for burnt kernels’.If this gets us even half the time our old one did it would be worth every penny. Highly recommend, would but again."
3,Nice microwave but received a dented product.
5,"Works well enough, haven't had any problems so far"
2,"I thought that all 700 Watt Microwaves would heat and cook the same -- this one showed how wrong I was!  The Amana that I had for 14 years could still do a better job than this lost ""Comfee"".  Definitely do not recommend purchase unless you want to heat your food a 2nd or 3rd time."
1,"The microwave was non-functional right out of the box.  As soon as it was plugged in, the platter rotated and the stop button would not stop it.  The start button did not do anything."
2,Came looking like was beating up with a ball bat. I know it was refurbished but damn.it still works fine so I haven't had a reason for returning it.
1,"I used it for 6 months, then the motor driving the turntable burned out and I had to get a new microwave oven"
1,THe microwave did not work had to return this back to amazon :(
2,"Tidy size. I like the appearance. Nice that it fits tall cups even though it doesn't take up much counter space. Easy to use control panel. That said, it just doesn't work that well. Not powerful enough. We need to adjust the cooking time for everything. Even an extra minute is not enough and it heats unevenly. Most annoying was that the microwave popcorn bag kept getting stuck and not popping all the way. We found that the prime heating time was 3 min, whereas our old microwave only needed 1.45 min to pop all the popcorn. Clearly not a deal breaker for everyone, we're just sick of food with cold centers. Sadly, we tolerated it past the return window so are just out the money. Meh"
4,"UPDATE: If you check out the the reviews OK the Alexa skill app for this product, you'll see I'm not the only one who Alexa worked for only for a brief time and then dropped off. Most of the reviews on skill are pretty recent, so maybe there's a fix in the works, but if Alexa is your interest with this product, I wouldn't buy it until it earns some better reviews on skill.Alexa worked twice but then started to claim ""no internet connection"" although the Toshiba app and the Alexa app beg to differ. Also don't trust sensor for defrosting. Baked about a half a pound of hamburger which it was only supposed to defrost. Otherwise, it's a good enough microwave. So, if neither of those things matter, go for it. It microwaves well. It's only the bells and whistles which overpromise."
2,"I agree with other reviewer‘s that it does the job, but has a major design flaw (very frustrating at times) that the glass turntable does not stay secure on its “Turner”. It wiggles or twists off the Turner easily, and this causes heavier items to not turn. It seems the ring underneath with three tiny wheels lifts it too high or something."
4,"Beautiful microwave, and I would give 5 stars, but the clock keeps getting off every time I use, I have to reset the time.  I kept it anyway, because I couldn't lift it and the packaging was thrown out.  Heats very well.  Other than time issue, perfect microwave."
3,Works fine but quite noisy.
1,"My previous microwave went kaput after many years  so I needed a new one. My space is limited so I went with this one, approx same dimensions as old one. I would've preferred white but that's minor. Easy to select cooking options and I am glad that I was able to find one with the push button open and lock system. Those with handles will sometimes slip and be difficult to open. It cooks and heats with less time required. I am happy with my choice!NOT SO HAPPY NOW!!!!! **UPDATE*** No customer satisfaction from manufacturer as somehow, Palmetto bugs have gotten in between glass on door, leading me to believe something is not sealed properly. I clean it everyday,no bugs anyplace else. They said NOTHING they can do.Problem started in Nov. ok from day of delivery til then. Is radiation getting out??????No offer of accomodation. So now I need to purchase another microwave.....4 months later. NOT happy!Another e-mail from Black n Decker telling me how to clean BUT bugs are between the glass>..leading me to believe they(or eggs) were there from manufacturing plant. Waiting for manufacturer again. This will be sent to their office while I shop for another, after calling BBB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,It works great at making food hot which is the core purpose.  However they went and over complicated the whole simple keypad timer that’s been standard since the 80sHanging to double click the time cook button to type in a non express time is just not intuitive at all.It made cooking a single hot pocket rocket science.  Type 210 in and boom auto 2 mins and that extra 10 seconds matters.  That’s when the cheese starts to ooze out of the splits in the pocket.  With out that you can’t tell it’s ice cold in the center.  2:30 and it’s rock hard or chewy.Way to go on screwing up the way things have been done for 30 years and just worked.
2,The media could not be loaded.Love this microwave at first but after one year it just stop working properly and don’t let children use it unattended because mines almost caught on fire
5,"We love this microwave, I was a bit hesitant about using the air fry option because putting metal in the oven is ingrained in me as a no go but I am pleased to say it works like a charm. One less kitchen appliance taking up space on the counter is great!"
2,"This product was solid...from May '21-September '22-what a short stint for this product.I expected, at least, it to last until '24/'25.Pizza reheats: Excellent.Recently, sparks shot out from the inside.Had to replace it.Disappointed. This product let me down, team."
2,I ordered this item on February 14th of 2016. It stopped working already. It didn't even last a full year with minimal use.
4,I gave this 700w away. I spent another $25 for a Hamilton Beach more features faster cooking warming.
1,"We have contacted the company and informed them of the defective work on our microwave and so far they have replied with a claim number and that is it, and we could get a real response in maybe a month, so much for customer service. The photos tell the story, in one photo there is a steak knife sticking in the bad area of the frame, in the following photos you can see the microwave light through the gap in the frame. The gap in the frame should not be there, it should be sealed totally, BAD WELDING. Looking at the photos the microwave light can be seen really clearly in the last photo. The microwave is really loud when in use, it growels loudly drowning out the TV that is in the kitchen. We have not had this microwave very long, less than 3 months, long enough to be out of the return time, we just did not notice the gap in the unit because the microwave sits at a angle on our counter top. We are thinking about buying another microwave, it will not a Farberware product. Don't buy this microwave!"
5,"This unit is an indispensable part of our kitchen.Perfect for heating water, defrosting dinner, or warming up the hot fudge for ice cream"
3,"The defrost setting (even when I change the power level)  isn't nearly as good as the Sharp I used to have...both 1000 watts.  Also, when I cook for the recommended time of the frozen product (chicken pot pie), the pie is very dry and chewy.  I wouldn't buy this item again, but maybe with practice, I'll figure it out.  (Chicken pot pie is MUCH better cooked in a regular oven, but it takes 40+ minutes.....)"
2,"About 10 months in, the microwave started turning off and wouldn't start up again for hours but would eventually work again. I figured that I tripped a switch or a circuit internally, like it overheated or something. Today at 11 months it died altogether."
4,"Love the price.  Love the child lock!  Putting in my mother's apartment, in a retirement home.  All of us kids have access to it when we come, but we don't have to worry about my Alzheimer's mother using it!"
4,I got rid of box and all before seeing this.
2,"This was returned because it did not match up well to the power rating. I did not expect this to be incredible - given size and price - but it is really weak. Microwaves prices went up in the past few years but on competitors priced just a couple of dollars more, you get better aesthetics and performance."
3,"I wanted this because I didn't want the clutter of a microwave and a toaster oven and an air fryer.  As a microwave, this thing works great.  As an oven or an air fryer, it works, but really slow.  For air frying, it takes about two times as long to cook your food.The programming for the oven and air fryer mode is a little complicated.  After a month, I can almost do it without looking at the instructions.I would have appreciated a user manual that talks about the combination mode.  I still can't get that to work properly.  Toshiba could help you along in this way, since probably a lot of buyers never had a combination unit like this.I regret buying it."
1,"This product was only used to heat up food and today January 25, 2022 I woke up at 3:00 am to go to my kitchen to make coffee it turned on by itself and something like a flash happened and it wouldn't turn off. I had to unplug it. Thank god I was home when this happened or there could have a fire.Patricia Rosado"
1,This never actually worked great from the beginning. The tray that rotates would skip and stop. Then every once in a while the food would be stone cold after going through the entire time chosen. Now after 3 months it won't heat anything. What a huge waste of money
3,"This oven is all right for the price- nothing to write home about. The first thing that struck me is that it feels cheap and won't last near as long as my last oven. The air fryer works, but it takes far longer than most instructions indicate, especially if you're looking for crispy (as in french fries or tater tots). When I follow instructions on French Fires I get nothing but soggy potatoes. It takes 2 to 3 times as long as they indicate (and yes, I have it set at the right temperature).  The microwave part works as expected. It's just that the thing feels cheap. Whenever I close the door I expect something to break! I hope not!!!"
4,My 25-year-old microwave finally died.  I read lots of reviews on Amazon before deciding on this one.  It's almost the same size as my big old Sharp.  Works great so far.
5,"I am absolutely in love with this microwave. I had to throw away my last one since it was 10 years old and really wanted an upgrade. I didn't realize how inefficient my old microwave was. It took it around four minutes to heat something, while this microwave takes 45 seconds. Since it is 1100 watts it is not small in size, but the power truly makes this worth it. My only complaint is the Alexa integration is useless and I could not get it to connect. I followed the directions to a tee. I connected to my Wifi with no problems, but when it came to the Alexa app for this microwave, I was taken to an air conditioning app that had nothing to do with this microwave. I tried several times, thinking it was user error, but the same thing kept happening. This aside, this is am amazing microwave, that has power, and looks nice on your counter."
1,Take forever  to heat  up and it makes noise
2,"2 weeks shy of 2 years of owning it the microwave started on its own about 11:30pm (we heard the sound, but thought it was from those living in our basement apartment) and kept running until it was discovered about 12:45am. Unplugging it, replugging it, repeatedly pressing the stop button, and other buttons did not keep it from running continuously. We've reached out to Farberware and are waiting for a reply. Our Whirlpool Microwave lasted over 20 years. This one should last longer than 1.9 years!Otherwise, we loved the size, power, function and look of it. Hope Farberware will make it right!Update:  Farberware Customer Service would not make it right. They gave us a code to use for a 30% off from a different website, nostagliaproducts.com, which has nothing like we wanted or need to replace this stainless steel unit, only retro brightly colored items. They said they could do nothing for us through Farberware. We will need to purchase another whole new one and will be sad not to be able to recommend this unit."
2,"I have had this microwave 9 months. It started sparking this morning, I tried all the phone numbers associated with it also warranty info and no reply. Amazon will not help  as it was 9 months ago. Do not buy Faberware  . No support for guarantees."
1,"We bought this microwave less than two years ago (one year and seven months actually) and it no longer works. When we try to use it, it pops as if there is metal inside. I'm super annoyed that we already have to buy a new one. Do not recommend at all."
1,Received this on 9/24 and by 11/3 it is no longer heating food.
5,I love the size of this microwave oven. It is not too small and yet it is not too big for a small countertop. I love the pull out door function and l love the quality of it so far.
2,I purchased this microwave for my senior citizen parents because they were having issues with their stove . It blew out after a about 2months and they didn’t even use it daily . Customer service for black and decker wasn’t much help . Very disappointing
4,"The media could not be loaded.DISCLAIMER: I bought this at Bed, Bath, and Beyond rather than at Amazon so I could more easily return it if I didn't like it, due to the lack of information online regarding the grill feature. However, I figured I'd leave a little mini review here in the hopes that it might be of some help to the next person. So:The grill feature! It comes with a little metal thingy you put into the microwave. Yes, metal. Yes, in the microwave. No, I have no idea why that doesn't cause the catastrophe that typically occurs when those two things intersect. The grill feature on its own involves an induction coil at the top of the microwave. It is quite disappointing on its own—only the tops of things get cooked, the underside is still raw. However, there's also a Combo setting that uses both the induction thing and the regular microwave. Yes, with a metal thing in there. I do notice that the microwave part isn't on continually in this mode, it kind of turns on and off in pulses. Maybe that's why it doesn't spark the heck out of the metal thing? I don't know, but the effect seems to be that the microwave causes the metal to get really hot, and then it seems to cook like an actual grill! I've provided a short video so you can get a look at a sausage I cooked in it tonight—there are grill lines and everything, it was as hot as it was supposed to be when I stuck a meat thermometer in it—it seems A-OK. Is it as good as a real charcoal grill in a backyard? Well, no. But if you live in a crappy studio apartment that doesn't have a backyard, it's pretty nifty.As for the microwave part: It's a microwave. It does what a microwave does. It works. It hasn't exploded on me yet (which right there puts it ahead of the old Panasonic I used to have). There's one weird bit of UI in the kitchen timer; the button that you push to set it, you have to push twice. Pushing it once sets the clock. One would think that setting the kitchen timer would be a more common operation than changing the clock, but hey. Also, the keypad feels mushier and less responsive than my old Panasonic's. But then again, the Panasonic blew up, so there's that. And at least it has a keypad, instead of just an annoying dial like a lot of microwaves seem to have these days. So, yeah. If this microwave's explosion-status ever changes, I'll update the review to let you guys know—otherwise, I'm pretty satisfied with this."
4,"I recently decided to downsize many things in my home as it is just me now and I'm no longer in need of having larger items. I have my extra large one to someone and ordered this one. It is perfect size for my needs. Works well, it's easy to use and is asethetically nice looking in my kitchen"
3,"Much as I expected. Don't like that there is no add time button nor quick 1,2 etc min buttons."
1,"It seemed to be lovely. My previous microwave was the same brand, with the inverter and has lasted for YEARS, it’s just too large for the new kitchen’s space. Just purchased this on 10/02/2023 for kitchen renovation. We took it out of the box and put it onto our new baker’s rack on 10/21/2023, so have only been using it for 15 days. My husband put a cup of coffee into the microwave to warm, shut the door, turned it on and then went to open the door and the panel that you press to open the door FELL OFF! It has to be a defective piece, as there are just he and I in the home; no children to treat it roughly and i couldn’t have used it more than ten times total. Naturally my return window ended 2 days ago! I have no idea what to do now."
1,"Returning immediately:1) The turntable stutters from day one. There is no fix. This alone caused me to return it.2) Clock/Cook time button: One of the most inept engineering/designs I've ever seen. The same button for setting cook time, is the same button for setting the CLOCK.When you press the button once, the number buttons change the clock (instead of the cook time).Press it twice, the number buttons change the cook time.See the problem here?Why, oh why,.....would they be on the same button, and the FIRST press is to change the clock?3) The beep when finished is VERY weak. Too expensive for a proper speaker?4) Power seems around 30-40% weaker than my last one at the same wattage.5) Probably other issues (as seen in other reviews), but I have barely used it so I haven't discovered them all yet.As far as I see, aside from #1, mine isn't defective. So I don't see how these have sold at all."
3,"Does not heat good the first time, having to reheat more than once to get desired temp. This microwave is supposed to be new. It sure as @#$% don't act like a new one. I paid the New price for it. The noise it makes sounds like it is struggling to heat, which is probably the reason it doesn't work right. DID I GET RIPPED OFF???  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS POS."
1,Was fine (did burn popcorn on the 3 minute setting but hey) until it totally stopped working after 18 months. Black and Decker’s ridiculous solution is to have me haul it to one of their remote service centers and haul back to pick it up. I’m just going to buy a new one from GE this time!
1,"This is a VERY loud unit, but we tolerated it because of the dual functions.Unfortunately, it failed at the 23 month mark. Convection works, microwave doesn't.Talked to an Amazon support person who said it was under warranty, and she brought a Toshiba person onto the call. That person also said this failure was covered. She had the Serial and Part numbers. She should know, right?Today, they called to tell me it wasn't under warranty, no discount even on a replacement, and sorry not sorry about being told something different on a recorded line.We use the convection very little, and can usually replace it with the air fryer for many things, the regular oven for everything else.It has a high quality feel, but the important components are not high quality. It was never moved once placed on the counter the first time, so no issues with that.Do not buy, the heavy construction will fool you into thinking everything is high quality.Oh, the UI was poorly designed as well. Want popcorn, push popcorn twice. Want convection oven? open door once it get to desired pre-heat temp. Need to bake a few extra minutes longer than you set the timer for? Go through whole setup routine from scratch. I used this as a demo in my engineering class on horrible UI."
3,"Good microwave but I wouldn’t count on the air fryer. All the moisture sits in the small pan they suggest you have to use for air frying.  if your making wings for example, there is nowhere for the moisture to go so you never get a fried type wing."
3,"We were looking forward to this appliance because it featured and air fry option. Not only is this part missing in the manual, it also does not produce anything like air fry meal.  So, if you looking for an air fryer, look somewhere else"
2,"This is such a wimpy microwave. Takes many, many more minutes to do things than my old one. It’s also small, but that was probably evident had I looked at the dimensions."
5,"Absolutely fabulous. I love that I can choose the specific amount of time (I hate it when the amount of time goes up by increments of 5 etc, instead of letting me choose the exact time I want)  ALSO I love that it doesn't automatically set a time for you by pressing a certain button (for instance, with many microwaves - you press the #1 and it automatically starts cooking it for a minute or adds 30 seconds) If I press 1 - I want it to MEAN 1 - and this microwave is wonderful with that! I LOVE that I can choose the exact time.  The beeps are not that annoying - I was worried they would annoy me but they don't and they heat the food quickly and evenly. It is not a hard to carry and came well packaged. overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase."
3,"After 2 years of daily use, the steam grate on the inside top of the chamber has rusted and the paint has come off it.  This unit has a lot of sharp angled seams inside that make keeping it spotlessly clean a hassle.Otherwise, the unit has worked well and cooked tons of food for us."
3,"The product was great for about a year. Then it started popping. I thought maybe food got on that little disperser plate or whatever it's called, but no. Thought maybe that plate was loose. No. Checked plug and wire and moved it to a different outlet. Still did it. Thought if I was super-gentle opening & closing the door it'd be ok. No. When it went from popping and sparking to a constant, loud buzz I just decided to order a cheapie from wally-world. I will say this lasted a year, it looks nice, and the light never went out for me like a lot of reviewers said. Just started scaring me and my cats half to death, and I can't figure out what's wrong. That panel has to be damaged, but I'm not seeing it. I even checked to make sure something I'd put in there hadn't picked up foil or something off the counter. Nope - all clear."
1,"I have used this microwave now for almost 2 months. I have attempted using power levels between ten and 1 and it seems to make no difference. The power level seems to be stuck on ""high"".My husband gave me a Hotpoint microwave, top of the line, for Christmas 1982. Everything worked perfectly up until Tuesday before Thanksgiving of 2018. I used it the day before and the next morning it was dead. I did not grieve because I had gotten good service.The purchase of the Panasonic was my first experience of shopping for a microwave oven for my home and I was excited. The heating on this microwave cannot be adjusted. Level 1 is the same as level 10.This is a huge item and the idea of returning it for repair is discouraging, yet it needs repair or replacement. I am so disappointed."
1,This microwave was doing its job for the first few months we had it.  Yesterday it started sparking and popping with white smoke billowing out.  Not really what you want to see in your appliances.Contacted Amazon and they pushed me to Faberware customer service.  Ugh.Can't recommend.
4,This Microwave has worked out great - the only negative feedback I have is that the film or whatever is over the numbers is already wearing and we've only had this for a short time.
5,"This is a nice microwave. I wasn’t expecting too much. It’s larger than my old microwave, which surprised me! I wasn’t expecting it to be that much bigger, but it was a noticeable difference with how much space it took up in the same area.It has 6 preset options - Popcorn, potato, pizza, veggies, beverage, and leftovers. I haven’t tried any of these. I did reheat leftovers but didn’t want to try the “leftovers” preset option since to me that’s kind of vague. How much time I reheat depends on the leftovers I’m reheating. So I just entered in the time I wanted.It also has a time defrost option and weight defrost option. Again, I haven’t used these. I never use the microwave to defrost. But, I never had those options before so I definitely see myself trying those options in the future.You can easily just hit the minutes you want - so for 1 minute just hit 1, 2 minutes just hit 2, etc. There’s also a quick 30 second button to heat things for just 30 seconds. It says can also hit the quick start 30 second button as many times as you want. But if you want to do any time other than whole minutes or 30 seconds, you need to press “time cook” then the amount of time and finally “start.” So, if you want to do 1 minute and 30 seconds, you have to press “time cook,” then 1 & 3 & 0, and then “start.” I really didn’t like that at first. It’s nit picky, but I realized how little I use whole minutes without any seconds in the time, and it took some getting used to having to hit the time cook, then enter the time, then hit start. With my old one I just entered the time and hit start. It seems like one extra button wouldn’t make a difference, but it definitely took getting used to! Now that I’ve done it a bunch, it’s no big deal. But it really annoyed me at first! Since you can hit the quick 30 second button as many times as you want, for 1 minute and 30 seconds you could hit the 30 second button 3x. So it helps not having to enter in the time, but still need to press the button multiple times. Again, since I’ve gotten used to it, I don’t see it as a big deal. But it took getting used to!I thought it was interesting this allows you to set 2 different power levels while heating up something. On my old microwave, you could change the power level but just one single power level. Not 2 different ones. Again, it’s not something I’ve used. On my old microwave I used the power level option a lot because my old microwave always seemed to overheat everything, so I’d reduce the power level anywhere from 50% to 80%. But with this one, it’s heated everything so well on full power I haven’t felt the need to change the power level at all.My main complaint with this - closing the door is pretty loud. I mainly got this specific one because it had the option to mute the beeping sounds, which my old microwave didn’t have. I live in an apartment and my son is often up late making food in the microwave and the beeping of him typing in the time and hitting start and the beeping of it going off always woke me up (yes, I’m a very light sleeper but it was pretty loud and I was also worried my neighbors would hear it…even though they never seem to care about making a ton of noise an inappropriate times so I don’t know why I do 😂). Anyways, now I’ve substituted the beeping for a loud bang/thump every time the door closes. Not sure which I prefer. At least it’s just 1 loud noise rather than beeping to enter time and beeping when it’s ready. But it’s pretty loud. There’s definitely no kind of sound dampening on it. It looks really nice and well made, but it’s very lightweight and hollow sounding. Even tapping on the top creates a hollow sound. My other microwave wasn’t like that at all. It either was constructed better or just had some kind of sound dampening. But, as long as I kind of hold one part and slowly close it, then it isn’t too loud. But if I just casually shut it without paying too much attention, it’s pretty loud.There’s also a slight buzzing noise. I think it’s the light in the microwave. I only hear it when I’m right up there with the door open. But it’s kind of weird.When it’s running, it makes a kind of whirring noise. It’s not too loud. And when the time is up it just stops since I have the sound muted. I like that.It microwaves my food really well! My other one seemed to overheat everything and not cook evenly. It would make the food hard in the center but still not be cooked right on the edges. I had to run it on 50-80% power in order to avoid that, and even then it still didn’t do a good job. This one does a great job! It heats the food perfectly! When I used to heat up something with meat, the meat would often be tough and overcooked. Now it’s tender and cooked just right. It heats the food nice and even.Overall, I’m really happy with this microwave! At first entering the time in was pretty annoying, but after doing it a few times I got used to it and now it doesn’t bother me. I don’t like the noise of the door shutting. But, like I said, as long as I’m careful how I shut it then the noise isn’t too bad so I’m also getting used to that. But it would have been nice if it wasn’t such a loud thud. I love how well this heats my food. It’s nice and even and the food never seems overdone or tough or hard. I also love the mute function so it’s not beeping when I press buttons or when it finishes! So I’m really happy with it!"
4,Just the right size for my family! It was easy to set up and simple to use.
3,"Air-fryer is a disappointment, sadly. Would have been nice, but takes just as long as in an oven and not crispy results."
3,"I was trying to get a little microwave for simple defrosting and cooking quick frozen meals. Forget this one. Although it is the right size, and quite attractive, the power level is ridiculously low. I donated it after a week or two. My unhappiness with the product had everything to do with my ignorance, and not any fault of manufacturer. Thanks anyway!!"
1,"I liked the size , but hated it wouldn't work."
2,Not happy with the microwave - It is very loud when turned on and very loud when you open and shut the door.  I expected better quality also.  I had really looked around at other microwaves and settled on this one - I was really disappointed.
4,The only thing I don’t like is that it is very noisy
5,I love this microwave!! It is big and heats much better than the one I had.  I will see how long it last!!
2,"It’s smaller than I expected.  It may work well for a dorm, but not fir using dinner plates.☹️"
4,"For whatever reason, the labels were printed in light grey giving hardly any contrast.  You cannot see it even with counter light.  The font is also small.  What is the reason for the product manager to make it difficult for user to read.  The ""air fryer"" is also not worth mentioning, nothing more than a preset for the convection.If you buy it for mircowave, it will be o.k. Don't expect more."
2,Works great and looks good.  Very loud when working.  Brand new and a week old.  2 stars for the loud buzzing.
2,worked just fine as an everyday water/food warmer. but it died after 7 mths. disappointing! off to buy another but not this one ever again.
1,"The microwave was great, but it died after 4 months of use.I purchased another Panasonic but a different model It was delivered yesterday. Hopefully it will last longer."
1,"When I purchased this microwave on 30 September 2019, it seemed fine. Very expensive and a little flimsy feeling, but did a fine job cooking food.Fast forward to January of 2020 and the microwave's internal components are now failing and tripping the breakers in my house. Since this was out of the 30 day window for Amazon returns, I had to contact Panasonic. Panasonic told me the only way to get it fixed was for me to drive it to one of their service centers a 40-50 minute drive away, and then drive back there and pick it up. This means I'd end up burning about 5 hours driving just to try and get this fixed. Panasonic would not ship the device back to them to get it fixed and left it entirely up to me to handle the repair.To say that this early failure on a $190 microwave is disappointing is true, but to then hear from Panasonic that I'm essentially on my own with dealing with the return after having gotten barely 3 months use out of said $190 microwave is ridiculous.I will never purchase another Panasonic appliance again, and would recommend everyone avoid them."
4,Purchased because it had good review and could be shipped to renter for self install. She likes it and has a nice appearance.
3,Very low power. Have to add 2 minutes to everything to get them to heat thoroughly
4,"I remodeled in my kitchen and needed a smaller microwave.  This one works well, but I miss the heat sensor my larger microwave had.  The dinner plate setting for this microwave takes about 7 min to heat the plate. I’ve learned to use the express cook in which it heats quicker."
1,"I specifically got this to pop popcorn in the basement. It is not good. Bags are too large to turn and they end up burning. Yes!  The bag!  And about 1/2 of the kernels pop on the popcorn setting. Truly disappointed and it is too late to return. If you want to warm coffee, that is all I would do with this microwave."
3,"This replaced by 27 year old Panasonic. The replacement was smaller than my old one. I originally bought the family size, it did not fit in my microwave cart that I put together myself 27 years ago. I replaced with this one.The reheat button take too long to reheat my food. I hit the quick 30 (sec) 3 times and my food is heated. I was hoping to get the exact same thing, but, companies always feel they have to make changes, sigh. It works ok."
1,"About 3 months after purchasing this microwave the numbers started to stick.  Randomly throughout the day it would start beeping and displaying 4s on the screen.  It's been a little over a year now and I can't even leave the microwave plugged in.  It just continuously beeps.  When I plug the microwave in, I have to hit the clock button and set the time to 4:44 before I can even attempt to get the unit to cook anything.  Sometimes it cooks, sometimes it just beeps and enters the number 4.  Half the time it won't register the pushing of any of the buttons.I rarely microwave food, so it's not possible the unit just wore out.  I probably put something in the microwave once a week.  Unless you only need a microwave for a month or two I wouldn't recommend buying this."
2,"This was a really good microwave until it suddenly displayed the H98 error.  “ The H98 error code indicates a primary failure in the magnetron or inverter circuitry.”. Basically means it would need to go to a repair person and with labor/parts/travel, it is probably better to buy a new microwave.  Boooo!  I have seen a lot of the inverter microwaves from multiple manufactures lasting around a year and then the electronics burn out.  Makes me wonder if they don't have it figured out."
3,I bought this in July 2016 so its not even two years old.  It blew up on me yesterday.  While it worked it was super.  But there is a piece of cardboard inside the oven and it kept falling down.  It finally burned up.  I believe this is a design flaw.  I won't buy it again.
2,You get what you pay for. Only the start and stop buttons work so I have to cook everything in 30s increments. This microwave is pretty awful. I'd recommend spending more and getting a higher quality microwave.
3,The turn table inside makes this rubbin together noise
1,"rarely ever use it and the past weeks it has been sparking and making weird noises. Today it caught a piece of paper towel on fire and if I didn’t catch it the second it happened, my whole kitchen would be on fire. I got this as a broke college student BUT DONT. All of these reviews are being serious when it doesn’t cook well and eventually will kill you in a house fire"
1,Broke after 2 years of using it. Warranty covers only for a year. Not a good product. Do not buy it.
2,"Air dryer capability not worth having.  You must place a metal stand on the glass plate and put your food in a 1"" deep pan and attempt to slide in on top of the rack without the rack falling off the plate.  If you succeed in doing this, Caution!  Top will get hot to touch.  If you need a microwave, buy a simple microwave."
5,This microwave is easy to work and clean.
4,"When my seven year old LG microwave decided to start powering up when I opened the door and me not yet having pressed any buttons I figured it was time for a replacement.  I chose this one.  I selected white as the unit sits and an alcove making black buttons harder to see.  Unfortunately, I took the risk of buying from Amazon Warehouse in order to save a few dollars.  Besides, that was the only purchase option at the time.  A mistake.  The microwave was a returned item of course and improperly packed.  I had a lot of trouble getting it to start microwaving.  I had two choices, return it and wait another two weeks to get a questionable replacement or I could crack it open and fix it.  I cracked it open.The unit kept thinking the door was open and refused to start.  The door was closed, but not tightly. When the door is closed, the top latch should push down on a switch closing the switch.  Then the unit knows the door is closed and will function.  The latch in this case was not pressing that switch down.  I took the cover off of the unit and made the tiniest of adjustments to the mechanism.  Now the door tightly closed and the latch properly pushed down and closed that switch.  I put the cover back on and proceeded to heat up a cup of mac and cheese.  It works just fine.  (To answer your question: No, I don’t think I could have repaired that LG microwave.  It had become dangerous and was destined for the dumpster.)The problem was likely caused by the door being slammed by whomever returned it.  They bought it, it was delivered, they unpacked it,  they set it up, they broke it, they packed it up and they sent it back.  In reality, a single screw was not tight enough which allowed the latching mechanism inside the unit to be pushed back when the door was slammed which resulted in the door not latching closed properly, the switch not being closed and the unit to not function.  We all know that Amazon quality control when it comes to reselling returned items is less than perfect.  As in non existent.  Once again I swear I will never again purchase from the warehouse.This unit is huge but it’s light.  I rarely use those programmed buttons for pizza and such so I don’t miss them.  It does have a popcorn button, but we use an air popper so that will go unused.  I will be trying the oatmeal selection in the morning.  If you don’t hear from me again then that worked just fine.  I really don’t use a microwave for cooking.  Mostly it’s for reheating or cooking all that frozen garbage.  If I do use it to cook it might be for bacon, soup, beans, a potato and the like.  Basically, I over bought for what I use a microwave for, but I’d rather have too much unit than not enough.  I always have the option of doing more with this unit.  I like the white and am glad I made that decision.  I’ll watch my return window in case the unit does start to act up and I’ll save the box and packing until that window closes, but I suspect that I will get years of service from this microwave.This is a very nice unit.  If you can get it without purchasing it from the Amazon Warehouse then I say go for it."
3,Not the quality as the older models
3,It as just too small for my needs.
3,"I purchased this unit two years ago for my sister in law, it had a nice mirrored finish and she loved it.  Two years later, I decide to purchase another one for my office.  It was the identical unit(same model number) however the unit arrived today and it no longer had a complete mirrored finish.  It has the mirror finish in the side as well as the bottom but the door itself is mostly black screened.  It's a functional microwave and I am probably too lazy to return it but it really wasn't what I expected.  I search through the reviews and noted that people who ordered it in 2016 still had the complete mirror finish but most recent order does not.  Again, I have no problem with the microwave, just wish Amazon would update the picture to the recent model.  Most people who viewed this item probably would assume it was something else since the first top review showed a nice complete metallic finish and most probably would not bother reading the rest of the reviews or the newer ones."
4,For the money it's stylish and works well. Only complaint I really have is the tray is very loose and will slide around a lot of you aren't gentle when putting something in it. If that is an issue you can work around (which I have) I would recommend but if not stay away.
2,"Works like a charm, the noise level isn't any worse then any other microwave i have owned. Its very classy lookingupdate :  2 years old bulb is flickering and not replaceable. Have had microwaves for years and this has never happened. would not buy again. The flickering is really aggravating when cooking or the door is opened"
3,Smaller than the description. Not the easiest to use... getting by
5,It's an average size microwave maybe smaller than most people are used to but it was the perfect size for me and my family I really like it because you can put the exact amount of time that you want on it it doesn't take too much counter space up and overall it's a really nice microwave would buy again whenever I need one
2,For some reason it doesn’t work well and it’s just too small big plates don’t fit in it
4,"I use this product to prepare frozen meals and defrost items and/or heat liquids.I wish the door opened from left to right and that the controls were located on the left side.Other than the above, it is working well for me."
4,"Ok it was easy to install as you took it out of the box, put the glass plate inside and plugged it into the wall. I worked with manual controls. I never tried the Alexa. I did find the buzzer or ringer on it was rather soft. It would go off and not be heard if out of the kitchen."
3,"Good little microwave. Got it out of the box, made sure it worked and bam there a huge ding in it. Like c’mon now. And it’s a freaking microwave, I don’t wanna out it in my car and drive it to a store to return it."
1,Bought this for my mother back in May of this year it stoped working by the end of October. Flashing a code H 97. I called customer support and the automated system told me they are experiencing high-volume and my weight maybe 20 minutes. Then it tells me that I may be charged $9.97 for the call! But I could chat with customer support for free and my Wait would only be about two minutes. So I went to their customer support Chat filled out the form. Push the request chat button and here I am 30 minutes later and no chat! Very frustrating experience so far!
3,I never intentionally buy non-stick cookware for obvious reasons.I relied on the fact that the description clearly states that the pan is stainless.This should be corrected.
5,"I wanted to run a microwave off RV battery power using a 1500W (continuous) Pure Sine Wave Inverter.  The specifications for this B+D microwave in the manual are 700W heat output and 1050W Rated Input (actual line power draw).  My inverter does run this microwave just fine, but my battery monitor displays a draw at the battery of 1375 watts when the microwave is running (with nothing else drawing power), which works out to a little over 1200 watts power draw by the microwave when one factors in the >90% efficiency of the inverter.  A far cry from the 1050 watts posted in the manual, a difference which can be critical when looking for a microwave for a low power or off grid environment.Note that trying to run the microwave at a lower ""power setting"" still requires the same 1200 watt draw.  The microwave will just cycle full power on and off, like it does in defrost mode.I am giving it an initial 5 star rating for household use, as it does everything it is supposed to do.  But I am disappointed with the misleading power spec in the manual.  I'll update this review if I run into any issues ""down the road"".  The price of this unit fluctuates, so shop around."
4,"This microwave uses more electric power than my previous microwave.  I'm going to have to purchase another microwave to be adaptable in my old kitchen , otherwise my electric box over loads"
5,"Works well. I do wish the button you press to make it quiet didn't itself make a beep noise, but it only happens once when you first initiate quiet mode."
1,"I am updating my review -- it died 18 months after purchase. We have had several brands pf microwaves. Never had one that stopped working  so quickly. It's too expensive to last such a short time.  Very disappointed.Easy, one touch button for heating. But for all the other functions like auto defrost, sensor cook, auto bake,, auto roast or convection etc. One needs to have the manual on hand to select the settings. We owned a Sharp convection oven microwave that we replaced with this toshiba. We did not need to consult the  manual at all because the prompts appeared for type of food, weight and so on upon selection of a specific function.  Also, the convection function doesn't work well. I had hoped to use the convection function instead of turning on my oven because it's supposed to be faster, but that didn't turn out to be true in this case. The chicken pieces I was roasting took longer than it would in my oven at the same temperature."
1,"After about 18 months of use, the unit failed, and would not power on at all, even across multiple outlets.  I went through Amazon to reach Panasonic support, and called the number listed.  An automated message took my call, warned there would be a fee to talk to a technician if the unit was out of warranty, asked what I was calling about, and advised me to look up the closest service center before terminating the call.  I never got a chance to speak to a human, and support was not helpful.Rather than waste time pursuing this with Panasonic, I will buy another brand after researching it."
1,"We did so much research to find a microwave that would fit our tiny galley kitchen, this one met all the requirements. It was good for at least 2ish years until last summer (2022) when we noticed the paint on the top of the inside was pilling off and exposing rust that had accumulated underneath. Would not recommend it if you are looking for a durable product."
1,"Failed after 4 months. Noisey as all hell. Farberware doesn't run their electronics anymore, it's Spectrum Home Appliance. $60 microwave at the best"
4,"This is a very nice unit with great features for the price. Quiet and powerful. There is one caveat, as other reviewers have mentioned, the keypad is very tricky. You have to press at the very top of the button to get it to register your input otherwise it may not register causing some issues when programming this unit. But my wife really loves this unit , flaws and all!"
1,It makes  a very loud grinding noise. When I was boxing it for return I noticed back of machine was dented in. It almost looked like a design- but looking closer I  believe it was dented in. Maybe that's why it was making a screaching or loud grinding noise when running it. Just heating a cup of coffee it would make a grinding sound like metal scraping on metal.
4,After a few weeks it seems to work well.
3,Perfect fit where we want it to be
4,"Looks great... I have a minuscule 1945 kitchen and needed a new microwave that fit in a small space. I've always gone with a giant microwave under the same premise of buying a huge car or truck... just in case I need to xxx.... which you never do. We heat up burritos,popcorn and frozen stuff that easily fits.  It isn't like I'm cooking a turkey in the microwave.The only compromise is that it is only 700 watts, so the package directions aren't going to be long enough. So give your stuff an extra 20-30 seconds... you'll figure it out. I know... food should be replicating and eating itself instantly for us by now... this is 'Merica!Controls are cryptic, I think the pictograms are supposed to make sense, but you will need the manual to get started.  I'm at the point that it's clock works and I can hit the 30 second button until it has the time I want to cook. Did not want to invest a 5 credit college class into learning the rest at this point.  I've left the instructions on top if I want to dig further.  Some of the symbols appear to be from ""The 5th Element"" so I'll forgive that :)It is super cute and retro looking with a nice build and the turntable spinning back to face the way it was when you closed the door is a nice touch.Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase.  We've been using it daily without any regrets."
2,Worked well for two years and then suddenly had large sparks/ flames on the inside while using it. Tried it again with nothing in it and same thing. Luckily I was watching and was able to immediately unplug it.
4,"It is the size I needed but found it strange that this one is not able to turn off the beep noises. I emailed the Faberware and they don't offer it. Totally on me for assuming that they would like most other brands. Too late to return it for me because we have used it, but won't be buying it again."
5,I bought a refurbished microwave and it arrived in excellent condition. The original box was missing but that was not important to me. I ❤️ my new microwave.
3,Takes twice as long to cook foods than my old microwave. It works but not as well as it should for a brand new microwave.
5,"Love it, I have a very large microwave that was here when I bought this house and it finally broke and I bought this small one and I love it so much more."
3,The inside enamel broke and started peeling after about 2 years. I needed a small microwave due to space constraints. Was very disappointed considering the good name this was labeled with. I expected more from Black and Decker.
1,"Broke after 8 months started sparking out of no where, cleaned regularly. Waste of money for price"
5,"Ordered this product to replace an older microwave oven. I wanted the Toshiba microwave oven which also was an air fryer and a couple of other features not offered with this model, but because of the wiring on the home we rent, could not exceed 900 wattage. I have found this oven works great. I don't think there is anything that has given me pause for concern.  It reheats food great without issue. I like the quick start feature. Since getting an air fryer, I have stopped using the microwave to warm up foods such as pizza and leftover fried foods. But I do use it for popcorn, warming up plates of food, and defrosting food from the freezer. Works great. Has an easy-to-see clock display. I liked it has a light which comes on while food is cooking. I would certainly buy this product again. We don't have a lot of space in our kitchen and this microwave fits on a metal shelf just fine. We placed it on wooden slates to help stabilize it. This is a great product for a good price. Looks great as well."
4,"We've had this for a few months now and I'm happy with it for what we use it for.I only reheat things in it so I don't need higher wattage or anything huge.PROS:  Solid, sturdy, very quiet, reliable, tapping ""Start"" button starts an auto 30 sec. program - keep hitting 'start'  and it goes up by 30 sec. increments.CONS:  You have to press pretty hard on the buttons, for timer you can't just press 1 30 for 1 min & 30 secs, you have to press 0 1 3 0 and pretty hard.  It's annoying.Choice of button function/setup is not what I'm used to &  seem to be  more complicated  than they need to be but not a deal breaker  =)It's a good unit so far and will update this if anything changes"
4,"The Toshiba ML-EM34P Microwave is supposed to work with Alexa.  It Doesn't!  Toshiba changed their software recently from MSmartLife to MSmartHome.  The MSmartHome app CAN control the microwave.I need the Alexa feature for someone visually impaired.  Worse, MSmartHome fonts are lilliputian and impossibly hard to read.2022 Feb 10: After uninstalling and downloading the MSmartHome software (a 4th time), Alexa CAN discover the microwave device and the skill CAN be added to 'her' repertoire. Note: A possible solution: After setting up MSmartHome the 4th time (a week after contacting toshiba tech support), not sure if the software changed or resetting the router was the final solution, but it works."
5,"This is my families 3rd Panasonic microwave and the previous 2 lasted for many years before they stopped. We have been happy with the brand and that is one of the main reasons we got this one. We have had it only a few months but it works great and we are happy so far.I know others have mentioned bad wi-fi and other problems but we have never had any of those issues.  If it dies early we do have the extended warranty but if that is necessary I will come back and dock stars for how long it lasts.Things we don't like:The sensor cook is a 1-14. We only use the sensor for baked potatoes so I had to memorize it was sensor #8. It would be nice if it gave some indication of what the numbers stand for but you just have to look in the book...not a deal killer but a small annoyance.It has a different layout for the buttons then the last Panasonic we had. The start and clear buttons are reversed and I keep hitting the clear instead of the start.  I have had 2 months to get used to it but old habits die slow.  I am starting to remember but why do they change the place of the start and clear on different models?!?Things we like (and what we looked for in chosing this model):Size. This is a big microwave and for our kitchen, this is our preferred size.Bright interior. We had a microwave years ago (can't remember the brand) that didn't last long and it had a grey interior. That is really annoying. This one is white on the inside and nice and bright.Inverter technology. Makes the cooking much more even and faster as well. At least they claim and it does seem to work.+30 second button. I prefer a +1 minute button but either way this is a must for our family.Just punch in the time and start. No weird push this button then the power level then time nonsense. It is very easy as it should be.Turntable. We like the evenness this provides. Seems to work for us so we always chose it."
1,Was to come with remote.  Didn't get one!.
3,"Don't plan on spending more than a minute or two in close proximity to this noisy appliance while it's operating. As a retired Air Force jet handler, I've spent my fair share of time using 'huffers' to light off those glorious jet engines...and the horrendous sound this microwave makes reminds of those good ol' days. Put on some ear protection and you'll do just fine."
5,Small enough for the limited counter space in my rental. Works well
1,"Tried using the air fryer and the unit lights up the convection sign. Cooked bacon for 20 minutes and it never did crisp.  The manual for this unit is lacking. I read the entire thing and it is not very thorough. The air fry cook book has recipes all for the convection oven. Now I know these are similar types of cooking, but the air fryer is meant to be more powerful.  The microwave for this unit is not very powerful either. And all the features make this unit very deep. So the two processes I really wanted are flawed and the unit is oversized. I'm boxing it up and returning."
3,"I probably would have rated this differently if there was more of a manual with it!This is my first Air Fry/Convection purchase it appears to be a very nice Microwave but it doesn't tell you how to use it properly. Why 2 racks one being bigger than the other, Do you cook on them if so does the little round pan go under it.Most appliances I have purchased have came with more user instructions and even at least one receipe to try with it.VERY VERY disappointed.If some one has suggestions on a cookbook I would truly appreciate it."
3,"The product is described as being stainless steel, exterior and interior. In actuality, the outside was black and gray, painted steel and chrome while the interior was gray plastic. If the stainless steel aspect is important to you, as it was for it, being used in our restaurant, be aware."
5,"Great microwave,  does the trick, and looks great in my office!"
2,"Edit... it didn't last a year with occasional use. While heating up a cup of coffee in a plastic cup, it made a horrible noise and flashed leaving a huge burn mark on the inside panel. No response from their customer service. I'd find a different one.Great small microwave. Works better than any large fancy micro I've ever owned. It's perfect size for our RV, but would be excellent in a home/office that needed to save on space."
2,"This microwave held it's weight for just over 2 years of general use. Then it just decided to stop working. When it is plugged in, it keeps running and the buttons don't respond to anything.  Decided to go with a Toshiba after reading similar reviews about other Farbarware models."
3,"Pros: It is red and has an oval window. It works.Cons: Cannot add time while it is in use. Cannot adjust feet, so it rocks back and forth. The place you put your thumb for leverage to open the door has already bubbled and peeled."
2,"The microwave started sparking badly, no longer working."
4,"I moved to a small apt and this was the perfect size. Functions very well. I would have liked to have a higher wattage, but the size is what I needed."
2,Unfortunately from day 1 the heating element cannot be relied on. The same temperature will never produce the same heat. I will be returning it. So disappointed.
4,"shorter length wise than I am use to, my only issue is the picture shows light grey stainless steel which I wanted to match appliances but this one is a dark grey color, but whats done is done."
4,instructions a little vague
4,"This is the second one of these that I bought, the first one started acting up after 3 years, the keypad would work off and on.  On the new one I bought the 4 year warranty.  My first one only had the 2 year extended warranty.I use this oven at least 5 times a day to heat and cook various things.  It's small, looks good in the kitchen with it's chrome and pewter color, matches well with the other high end stuff from Kitchen Aide (blender and toaster).On the down side, the buttons are small, and it's a little noisy.  But it will take anything on a full size dinner plate and like I said it looks good.  Overall I like it because I bought the same one twice and for the price you can't beat it....."
1,"Upon delivery, we removed it from the box, took all the tapes and plastic coverings off, and plugged it in. We tested it for 1 minute with a bowl of water and immediately it made an unusual vibrating sound. After a few seconds it got very hot on top and a burning plastic smell came from the back. We returned it immediately."
5,"Finally, a test for Alexa that I can eat.  Honestly, when my old microwave started getting doddery and it was time to replace it, I saw this oven that can be controlled with my Alexa Echo device.  Honestly, I got it out of the box and set it up in less than 30 minutes and in no time Alexa was attentive to my commands and cooking for me.  I didn't have to worry about learning how to operate the buttons on it or anything, though through practice of giving Alexa the appropriate verbal orders I find that I can now set my timer, do my own button pushing and everything in case my Alexa is not available, like when I have to use a strange microwave.  Just because you have a robot to help you doesn't mean you don't have to do some heavy lifting on occasion, so that's an asset."
5,"I purchased this as a component of the conversion of my 2014 Honda Odyssey to a camper van (that's another story).  The small size and low power drain were major considerations, as power will come from a Jackery portable power station.After receiving this microwave, I set it up in my kitchen for testing and familiarization.  This also provided opportunity to compare the B&D with the Sharp 1100W microwave which is a permanent feature of my kitchen.Wow!  The Sharp is the size of a Volkswagen and weighs somewhere north of a male water buffalo.  The B&D is small, lightweight, accommodates normal dishes, and is all around easier to use.  The B&D does take slightly longer to heat items, but the time difference is trivial.I am strongly considering sending my Sharp to that big dumpster in the sky and either (a) buying another B&D for my kitchen or (b) simply transferring my current B&D back and forth between kitchen and camper duties.Nothing bad to say about this outstanding piece of equipment!"
5,"This replaced an equal sized microwave. It’s great, heats perfectly and looks great on our counter!!"
1,This is a shockingly terrible microwave.  I have had many other GE microwaves that worked great.  This heats stuff very unevenly.  It only heats things if you put them in the exact middle of the machine.  So the edges of your plates are always cold.  I barely use I micro so I thought having a tiny machine wouldn’t bother me - but when it always messes up with basic things like popcorn it really drives me bonkers!
3,"the unit functions just fine.  However i bought it because i have an 11"" dish that i use to reheat leftovers that i needed to fit inside.  so i was excited when I saw the internal dimensions were 12""w x 11.9"" d.  Imagine my disappointment when it wasn't even CLOSE.  Only 10.75""W x 10.25""D, and the usable height (once you consider that you have to subtract for the revolving tray is only 6.25""."
1,Awful! It Takes forever to heat up. It takes 3-4 minutes just to gear up a cup of tea! Sending back.
4,Good product but will skip around if not pushed right up against a wall.
2,"Microwave was fine for the most part until it started smellimg like burnt plastic after about 15 months.It also a little clumsy inputting cook times given the last of a number pad, but you get used to it"
2,Works but it’s not pretty.
1,Returned for refund.Greatful for that option.Arrived broken.
3,….for the price
1,I’ve owned this for 6 months and it’s already dying. The power level is very low and barely heats anything up. DO NOT BUY THIS.
3,"The touch interface needs improvement, as they are not sensitive enough to presses.  The turntable in the microwave started making horrible noises after a short time of use.  The features of the microwave made it a good value...I'm now concerned about the longevity of the unit.  I'm glad I bough the extended warranty."
4,"I wish this microwave had a more intuitive interface. You get stuck with the membrane keypad that's reminiscent of an Intellivision controller. The white led display is pretty unimpressive and the annunciator is straight out a Casio adding machine. The front bezel is nicer than average and the cabinet is good quality though. performance is acceptable and it does operate more quietly than most. Our unit still smells like a melting Barbie doll every time you run it, the insulating jacket on the Chinese wiring no doubt."
1,product came with scratches on the side and front
5,"I love this microwave! It’s very nice looking, quiet, and works great! The size is also very nice. I would buy again."
3,Noisy during use. Nice size.
3,Buttons are hard to push.  Not very powerful. Takes a lot of time to reheat any food.
4,Menu buttons hard to see color and led light inside dim but works ok
2,Unfortunately the mechanism that rotates the dish while cooking suddenly stopped working.  Tried to reach Panasonic for questions either how to resolve to how to send for repair. No phone numbers so used chat.  They asked for all information about purchase and I provided all necessary documentation.  They acknowledged receiving it and said I would hear how to proceed.  That was two weeks ago.  I have since sent emails requesting response but have heard nothing.  At this point I need to purchase another microwave because I can’t get any response from Panasonic at all.Needless to say it won’t be a Panasonic
3,The display has become partially defective.
4,"After 20 years it was time to replace the old microwave. This one fit the counter space, has high wattage, cooking features that fit my lifestyle. Only wish there was more light inside, or a white interior to better see the item being cooked when it is time to stir, check for doneness.  It's kinda like looking into a cave with a low wattage flashlight instead of my old one that had a bigger wattage lightbulb and white interior to allow easy visibility of food inside the microwave."
4,We have had no problems works fine
3,Can’t see the dimly lit timer power controlDoor will not open easily unless you take a double short / Long hold approach to pushing the open button then it releases the door otherwise ithevsensor feature makes perfect oatmeal
1,It worked fine at first. Then we started noticing a burning odor. We finally gave up when the microwave started smoking out of the vent where the light is located.
4,Product came damaged in the back left corner. I managed to bend it all back so I didn’t have to return it. Needed a microwave bad. Overall I got it to attach and rest properly in the space. Works great. Looks nice.
1,"We liked this microwave until it started making loud noises after a couple months.  Now at 7 months, the light turns on and the turntable moves, but nothing gets heated.  It is now essentially useless.  Order at your own risk."
2,"I bought this Toshiba microwave above the base unit  because I thought it would be nice to have Alexa integration. But even though it says it is enabled, Alexa won't recognize it. I feel that I wasted the extra money and hope my unit is as good as the reviews say the basic unit is. Disappointing!"
5,Nice machine cooks evenly and is easy to use
5,"This microwave is so great! We have been wanting to get a smaller microwaves to set on a hanging shelf. This is the perfect addition. Stainless steel front, looks great, easy to use! It really does hold a large dinner plate! We've put all the same things in this microwave as we did our last full-size one. This microwave requires a longer cook time, but not by much. Most things just an extra 30 seconds. Would totally buy it again. I was afraid of any non-major brand microwave, and GE has never let me down."
1,I am very disappointed
4,"Very nice microwave, moreover, fantastic customer service and order processing by Amazon."
2,"I just purchased my 2nd small, green adorable MUTED microwave since March of 2021.  I found this microwave to be very annoying to figure out and had to read directions constantly about how to make it work.  It also quit and sparked for no reason after about 1.5 years of use.  I loved the mute button and how it looked and fit into my space so I ended up purchasing another since I couldn't find another that had all the same things that were important to me.  Hopefully this one lasts longer and I get the hang of how to do things with it.  I'll update in the future since it's such a major part of my life. lol"
4,"The microwave seems fine, but there is a sticker below the code pad that says something like ""remove xx before use"" and when you remove that sticker, it kind of messes up the front covering. Otherwise fine."
4,"Large inside, power level, keep warm feature"
5,"Perfect size, love the color and it works great."
2,"Microwave is starting to rust on the outside:  on (1) the brushed steel handle; and (2) the brushed steel around the large window in the door.Otherwise, still works okay after 2 years of light use."
5,"Great deal on a name brand microwave, fast delivery, perfect price"
4,"The box was so crushed, the entire verticle corner on both ends were pushed in and torn open, you could see and touch the microwave from the outside. It's a miracle it wasn't damaged and I didn't have to return.It wasn't double boxed, amateurs.Perfect microwave for my needs, though. Compact, a little noisy."
4,"I got a white one to make reading the membrane keys easier. I don't know why appliance makers love to print data in light gray against slightly darker gray. Is the information secret? White is easier to read. The door opens with a pull-handle, not a counterintuitive push-button. The controls are not completely easy to operate and the instructions that come with it are useless. You have to do some experimenting to learn how it works. Sometimes, some buttons have to be pressed twice to activate them, for example.  It's only 0.7 cubic feet, just big enough for a medium dinner plate, but I only need it for reheating one serving or one cup of tea or one bag of flax-seed warmer. It's only 700 watts so things take longer than the ""big"" 1000W micro in the kitchen, but that's fine: what's the rush. Operation is surprisingly quiet.  All in all, it's a perfect, small, attractive micro or for any small space or as an auxiliary in an office or non-kitchen."
2,Over cooks my food
1,"This microwave does not work well. When heating something, it smells like burnt wiring & it has a horrible sound to it. I cant return it now & have to buy a new microwave. Im very disappointed in this product."
1,"We purchased this microwave less than 6 months ago. It worked just fine until about a week ago when it wouldn't shut off. I had to unplug it and when I tried plugging it back in later in the week, it still did the same thing. It just runs unless the door is open.I did a little research and read that a relay might be sticking, which means I would have to replace the motherboard. It costs around what the unit itself costs. Um, no. That's okay. I'll just eat the $55 I guess. I will, however, leave this one star review to warn potential buyers that it probably won't last long."
1,This item died after 9 months of use.  I have never had a microwave die on me let alone in 9 months. Have tried to contact seller but have gotten no response. What a waste of money.
5,Using the beverage button it doesn't heat up my coffee like a coffee maker keeps it so I just use the normal time setting and heat my coffee for longer instead of using the  beverage button.
3,"Alexa integration does not work. Everything the others said about the app being horribly supported are true. I made an account in ""MSmartLife"" and can control it from the app, but when linking to Alexa using the ""Toshiba iMicrowave"" skill, I get a ""username/password"" incorrect error. I've checked it 3 times, it's correct, but there's no way to reset or link my account to it. A tap on the password reset link, takes me to a generic landing page for the parent software company ""Midea"" and yet, ANOTHER app to download, this one for A/C units. No way to link the Skill to the MSmartLife account without errors, so no voice-activated microwave for me. :(Advertised as working with Alexa, when it really can't. Almost there, but a lack of app/developer support really hurt this product."
2,"The Alexa integration is a farce or simply a joke.  Like so very many other victims -- based on the reviews and comments -- I bought this appliance primarily for the Alexa integration, but it worked for just a few weeks.  After that, Alexa responds: ""Hmm, microwave oven is not responding.""  Also like so many other unhappy buyers, I have tried every prescribed fix as well as some of my own, but nothing works.  Unfortunately, neither Amazon not Toshiba seem to care either; so they offer no valuable help.  DO NOT BUY this Microwave Oven for the Alexa Integration.  You will be abysmally disappointed!"
3,"It cooks food very well, but it sometimes shuts itself off like there is a power failure and we would have to wait for it to come back on."
5,Five star cause I love the look and perfect size.  I cant remember if I've used it.  I bought it just in case.
4,The Microwave works well but is so much stronger that our previous one. We have yet to find the correct time to reheat.
4,"I had been using an approximately 4 year old LG microwave, that started peeling along the 'tracks' beneath the plate. I opted to buy another microwave rather than bother with a repair (had planned to give my old one to someone else who would repair it and use for many more years to come). Read good things about Panasonic so decided to give this one a go. This one is lighter in weight than the old one (different build quality), but heats better. I will treat it with care and keep my fingers crossed that it lasts."
2,It will not stay on no more than 3 or 4 minutes. It gets too hot and it cuts itself off. Then it will cool off for about 5 minutes then the power lights come back on.  There is a large dent on the right side near the back. This was a discount item. I still paid 69.00 for it.
5,Size and look works great
4,Its smaller than I thought but it works beautifully!
1,"Shipped and sold from AmazonThis was a great microwave all the way until today, June 8th 2020.Reheated some leftovers on a microwave safe dish. Suddenly there is a hum, a fizz noise, and a burning smell with smoke. Inside there is a black scorch mark where there SHOULDN'T be one.When contacted, Amazon directed me over the phone to Toshiba, and promptly left the conversation. Toshiba said ""we need proof you bought it through Amazon"" So I'm getting the runaround from both companies.I don't see why Amazon can't ship me a new one, and then deal with Toshiba directly, since it came DIRECTLY from Amazon. I'll update this rating if I stop getting the runaround from either company."
5,Easy to operate and cooks food quickly
1,I wish I had spent a little more for a microwave that would last at least five years.  This one lasted just over a year.  I've never had a microwave that just konked out.
2,Was great for about a year. Then the inverter stopped working. Just try to get hold of anyone at customer service. Go ahead. Try.
5,easy to use and follow directions. Low noise level. Heats well and easy to clean
3,While I do like this microwave/convection/air fryer I would have been very happy with some decent directions!  There was nothing beyond the minimal how to directions. No directions on using it's three functions and I've had to learn my trial and error and looking things up.  I'm very disappointed in the manufactoer for not elaborating for buyers.
4,"Got this model to hopefully reduce the number of small appliances, but the air fryer/bake feature is no comparison to a good stand alone"
2,"The best feature to me WAS the sensor cook button.  I say “was” because we only got a years worth of this feature.  It doesn’t work and I found out the hard way.  I put in 2 scrambled eggs and used the omelette button as I do every time and walked away.  As I came back minutes later to take it out of the microwave, the microwave was still running.  My eggs were brown and hard.  Gross.  Same thing happened to my oatmeal.  I cook oatmeal at least 4 days a week.  I thought I pushed the wrong button but nope.  Oatmeal mush.  Very disappointed in most companies.  Nothing is made to last more then a year.  Our previous microwave we had for 20 years AND it was still working.  I just wanted something more current.  Oh well.  I will just use this microwave to reheat things."
3,It was one inch smaller and one 100 watts less than the more expensive microwave. I honestly cant tell the difference. The only thing I hate is the buttons are small and hard to read. And yes I can fit a regular dinner plate inside or a regular size cup.
3,"Over past 2 months now when starting the oven, it makes an odd grinding sound. I have to open the door stopping the cook, close again and restart to make the grinding stop. Now it's interior light is flickering along with the grinding sound.It worked well the first few months and love the silent option as I live in an apartment and work odd hours so I like to be quiet for my neighbors. But the grinding and flickering worries me that when I leave I unplug the machine in case it might start a fire. Looking into the warranty I purchased to go along with the oven is basically telling me it won't do anything regarding damaged/defective items. So I guess I'll shop around again"
1,This microwave seemed to be a nice one until recently. It just completely stopped heating any food up. It’s only been 6 months since I’ve purchased it. Very disappointing especially since microwaves aren’t cheap. At least not for our family. I’d avoid this one if you can’t afford to replace it after a short time.
4,easy to use and works well
1,Bought this in March of 2020 and it's already stopped working correctly (Didn't even last a year). Whenever the door is shut it will run but isn't actually heating anything. It won't shut off unless it's unplugged or the door is opened. You can push buttons and it just keeps running.
4,Work like it should for a pretty good price.
5,"This microwave is big enough to heat a pizza! The inversion heat really does make a huge difference! The food is heated evenly, no more random cold spots.  The design is standard. The door feels “ tin-y” cheap but most do. No problem just a pet peeve. Make sure you look at the depth measurements because if is huge. I would definitely buy this again!!"
3,"The Farberware microwave will not be your primary microwave.  its good at warming things up, like oatmeal or coffee.  Its good for pooping microwave popcorn.  That is about it.  The microwave simply does not have the capacity or power to replace your main kitchen microwave.  It took almost 12 minutes to ‘bake’ a potato.It would work well in other settings in the house but there are a few things to keep an eye on.  First si the door.  The handle sticks far out of the front of the microwave.  It also takes some effort to open and the microwave is so light that we almost pulled it off the shelf a few times.Overall, its a good second or third appliance.  More ideal for a dry sink/bar in a basement, the same in a bed room for morning coffee or a camper, college dorm room etc."
4,"Plastic is pealing, not happy with that. Does work pretty great"
1,"It’s an OK microwave, fitting small spaces, powerful enough, and doing everything a basic microwave is supposed to do. It, however, is not a “Toshiba”, but rather a Chinese (Midea) microwave sold as Toshiba due to Midea’s having bought Toshiba’s home appliance business. The latter may explain why the microwave’s UI is messed up (1 button press for clock set, 2 button presses for cooking timer?!?), and strongly smells of plastic.[update] Having used it for a few months, I’ve realized the heat distribution in this microwave is uneven: there is almost no heat in the bottom half of the interior. If you put there a half-full mug of water and try to heat it up, the liquid will remain lukewarm, yet the top half of the cup (the glass) will be red hot. This oven is utter garbage."
2,"I was 1 day too late to return this - going to charity.  Touch pad too small, flimsy construction, dark gray interior (assume the import factories had an excess of battleship gray paint) with not enough interior light.Just another cheap planned-obsolescent soon-to-be-landfill item."
1,Microwave showed up on front porch In manufacturer’s original box packaging. Upon opening found the side/ front had large dent by keypad. Plugged it in and it doesn’t have power.
4,This microwave is quite small. Good for microwaving small meals or reheating left overs.
1,"The media could not be loaded.The Love;First off let me say I really like the Microwave.It has a nice sleek design that fits my kitchen look.Its not too noisy when running but the finish alarm is different and will get taking use to, It chirps instead of beeps.I like the LED lights which matches all my kitchen lighting.It really cooks fast and seems more powerful that anything I've owned in the past.The button layout is easy for me to see and use.The Hate.I started off confusing the SmartLife app and the app used on the appliance which is MSmartLife.I've used SmartLife in the past for smart light bulb setups so I already had an account there.I spent hours trying to pair this with SmartLife till it dawned on me to scan the bar-code on the instruction sheet.Once I set that app up it found the Microwave instantly.All the excitement faded as I realized that MSmartLife didn't like my WiFi signal.I knew it was the required 2.4 Ghz but for some reason it wasn't excepting it.So now I've decided to upgrade my really old original Fios router to something that is suppose to be more automatic and setup friendly.I'm not giving up, I'll post and update later.Update; I was able to get the set up both in MSmartLife and the Alexa apps. My old router was the problem. I added a newer router to my old Fios router giving me better WiFi.Update: It decided to disconnect from Alexa, what a pain. Now I have to set it up all over again...or notNew Update; My 2 year old Microwave bulb flickers like crazy, You have to take off the entire housing to get at it. Hard on the eyes. I'm think about dumping it and get a new microwave from a different manufacturer"
4,"UPDATE:  6-12-16I rarely lower the rating of a review, but unfortunately this has to be done.  I corrected the problem with glue, but I also determined it was so delicate, that this will likely be a common problem with this unit.  Without using much force at all I opened the door and the handle came off, it was light cheap plastic, and despite the unit costing 40 bucks more than the cheaper version, the cheaper version had a much stronger handle.  These microwaves have to be expected to be opened and closed frequently. I don't understand why this handle is plastic and hollow cheap plastic when it should be stainless steel like the body of the unit.  Some bean counter got carried away with the cost cutting here and cut the quality too deep!  I suggest an easy redesign and fix this issue, this seems to be the flagship of the counter top ovens, so it needs to be durable.  Note the door will open by grabbing the bottom and pulling even without the handle, but that's not very good.  I came close to docking this two stars for this, but I leave it open hoping the company will improve the product.  It shouldn't take much.  As is I can't imagine a typical family use not breaking this current handle within a month of ownership.REST OF THE EXISTING REVIEW:I had just gotten and reviewed one of these Farberware microwaves a week or so ago.  Why did I want to get this one when I have one upstairs in the kitchen, and one on the counter downstairs in the older kitchen. Everything basically checks out the same they are both 1000 Watt units, both have standard carousels, and the exact same keypad arrangements and features. In all honesty, I like the white surface better than this brushed stainless, ti does not show the fingerprints on it like this one.  What was it then that made me want this one.Well my sister destroyed my favorite microwave when I loaned it too her last year, by plugging it into a defective outlet.  It was my favorite for more than the multi-touch frozen dinner button that I used so much, there was something I liked even more.  This microwave has it and the one from last week's review does not.  The keyword is height, If you look at my review from the previous Farberware, you'll notice I have an overhead microwave, vent fan and convection oven above my stove.  When I had my old microwave in the upper level kitchen, I barely used the convention/microwave for anything more than the vent fan, for when I cooked on the stove, or used the gas oven below.  The reason was that despite it being a 700 dollar microwave/vent/convection oven, it was only 8.5 inches tall on the interior compartment.  Subtract another 3/4 of an inch with the rotation plate for the carousel.  I make a lot of casseroles, Au gratin potatoes, stews and other cook style dishes.  The problem is being single, I can't eat the whole thing at one meal, so into the fridge and back out to the microwave.  Reheating on the stove on in the over takes too long, and things get burned, so the microwave has a lot of good use here.  My casserole ceramic dish is square about 8 inches tall with a glass lid.  I have a circular one about 7 and a half inches tall also with a glass lid.  In both cases with the lid on they are right at about 9 inches tall.I've tried two things, one inverting the lit so the glass lift knob is down inside the pot, but that is problematic fishing the lid out, it makes it hard to stir halfway through to get the heat distributed properly.  This Farberware microwave has a 9.8 inches tall opening, it fits my dishes, and is fine for pizza, popcorn, and other food that needs some space.  You know what I mean if you've stayed at those budget hotels, and tried to make popcorn.  I took to buying these mini bags, because the large size would stop turning in these tiny microwaves, and end up getting burnt.  You won't have that problem here.  Plus if you have a stainless theme, this may be more for your coordinated color, and if you don't it's just as neutral as the white one I reviewed the last time. There that's it not too many differences, and the main one is this is about 3/4 of an inch taller in the compartment.In this case, little things mean a lot, like a little extra headroom in this microwave make it more attractive to me than the previous model.  Besides casseroles, reheating rotisserie chickens, using tall splatter covers for soups and stews, or just making popcorn and being able to raise it on an upside down paper plate so it cooks better is enough to justify the price.  The overall footprint is barely bigger than the other model, so it won't consume more counter space.  Recommended for those who make heavy use of the microwave oven.  Re-heating chores become much easier when you have the room in the microwave to fit the dishes used."
5,"I thought this would replace my air fryer, but it would not. Originally bought new but had to settle for ""Like new"" after carrier dropped it and the order was cancelled. Reordered on the spot as soon as I read the cancelation. It is more of a convection oven with a fan at the back. Don't get me wrong, having a convection oven and a microwave combined into one is a huge upgrade for my tiny apartment but I feel it is not hot enough..? I had to add additional time for almost every item I've tried to cook on it so far. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Speaking of wrong...the manual. It makes no sense to me, whoever put that thing together was drunk or high. I could not find instructions on how to operate the air fryer, its main selling point. The microwave? 100% on point. After all said and cooked, it is a good purchase. I just need to figure out how to use it on my own."
5,"When researching Panasonic microwaves, there were seemingly many negatives named. However, I think the most important question is the outcome. This Panasonic microwave does the best job of heating evenly anything we have used it for over our first few months of use. It takes some getting used to the 1200 watts of power as it can cook faster and hotter than our previous 1000 watts microwave. I would like to address some of the negatives in other reviews. The light in this model comes on when you open the door. When setting the power level, there were many objections to needing to push the button say 3 times to go from 10 to 7. However, you need to push and hold the button down as it goes from 10 to 7 or whatever the  power level you desire and stop pushing. The light in the microwave when cooking is not as bright as one might hope, but it is adequate to see if something not good is happening. Overall would strongly recommend the outcome of using this microwave."
1,THERE APPEARS TO BE A SHORT AND THE SELLER WILL NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEMTHE CONTROL PANNELL IS MELTING WHEN YOU COOK SOMETHIMG IN THE OVEN CYCLE. I ALSO HAVE THE ADDITIONAL INSURANCE AND CANNOT GET ANY HELP. I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS 4 MOMTHS . THEY ARE TETTIBLE I HAVE ALOT OF THIER PRODUCTS AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER. BUYER BEWARE
4,This microwave does the job in my new small kitchen. I only gave it 4 stars because the button layout is weird compared to the unit I use to have but I am getting use to it.
2,Can’t figure out how to cancel if you pull something out early. I’m holding onto the box for a week while I try to figure this out. The instruction manual is of no help.
5,This is a perfect micro oven to have for employee use. Small and very easy to use.  Very happy it has an automatic turn tray in it. Price was just right for the purpose. Very pleased.
2,"This machine was purchased because it supposedly has the capability to be an air fryer.  Unfortunately, that function is doesn't work.  I have called the Toshiba helpline multiple times, and they are useless.  They tell me what the manual says, which is to press the air fryer button to use.  But that doesn't allow you to cook a real recipe.  In order to cook food other than the 10 items listed for their buttons, you have to be able to adjust levels and length of time cooking.  As far as I can tell, that isn't possible with the machine.  I have written to Toshiba's helpline but have not heard back from them.Save your money and buy a less expensive machine."
3,Looks nice. Mine was defective so I returned it.
4,scratches on microwave from delivery but it works fine
2,This unit beeps too much. I can't seem to turn that off. It doesn't have a one button start. You always have to choose some function or enter a time. It works well but the noise is annoying.
5,The microwave fit my space for it perfectly (I did measure my space before ordering).  It's has a large interior for bigger dishes such as a turkey.  I did not want a microwave that talked to other appliances.  This one doesn't hear or speak a word. I like that.  It's quiet when it is in operation.  It is easy to clean.
1,This turntable does not stay on track it come away from where it should be in place. Price was responsible but would rather had payed a higher price to have a working tray to stay in place so I give this item no star it’s not worth it
1,"Smelled funny right from the beginning like burnt wires, thought maybe ""just new smell"" off & on making funny noises & off & on smelled like burning wires. Just stopped working this morning!  Didn't even last 1 year 😪"
1,"This is the worst microwave (probably appliance, overall) I've ever owned. It takes 4 minutes to heat a cup of coffee, and is super small. The turning plate falls off the stabilizer everytime I use the microwave. I got rid of my old microwave because Black and Decker has never disappointed me, and I regret it immensely."
5,Absolutely love this
4,"My last microwave looked great, but had an annoying jingle and no mute button. Life was not good with it. It also had a feature where you could turn off the clock and it would stay off. Toshiba calls it ecomode, but sadly it requires you to do it every time you use it. Greenwashed nonsense, but I do like not having a clock shown.First meal was a frozen pot pie using microwave/air fryer method. The box says microwaves under 1100 won't work. This being 900 watts did fine with 6 minutes full power and 5 minutes in the air fryer. Came out 90% as good as oven method in 40 minutes less time.Microwave looks great, better than newer model which is why I took discount over ."
1,"Brought in 2017 to replace older microwave. This model didn’t even last 30 months of occasional use. Had a few issues with keypad (sometime had to push pad hard a couple of time) but otherwise seemed liked an OK microwave. However, woke last night to it running by itself (start/stop/start/stop...) and very hot!! Pushed the Stop pad and then it ran continuously. Only way to stop is to unplug it !!What would have happened if we weren’t home?  Would it have caused a house fire. We will not replace this module or buy any other Faberware electronic product going forward.There are other reviews that talk about the Stop pad failing and this model just running on by itself. BEWARE!!"
4,This looked like a great microwave but unfortunately we never got to use it because there wasn't enough clearance from the top of the microwave to the bottom of the kitchen cabinets. It needs 12 inches for venting purposes. We only had 6 incnes. Toshiba needs to make the top and sides and back clearances stand out at the top of their information.
5,"This microwave oven is amazing. It heats quickly and evenly. The buttons are large enough to press even for bigger fingers, and easy to read for those with vision impairments. The door uses the push button to open, and doesn't open on its own (I can't pry the door open from the bottom of the door). I use it often and have never had problems with the cooking, the electronics, or even the size of the product. It works well in our small kitchen."
5,I love Toshiba brand products. I had a laptop that was the best but it is no longer compatible with my local internet company and can no longer use it. This microwave is exceptional. It Heats your food so fast. I had to make a second bag of microwave popcorn the first time I used it because it cooked my microwave popcorn fast and I actually burned it a bit. It took making a second bag to determine how long to cook the popcorn. Don't wait for the popping to stop just look for the fullness of the bag. Heats up food extremely fast and I wouldn't trade this microwave for anything else
1,Key pad doesn’t light up! Too hard to see!
1,it was awesome until the oven stopped working.
3,"I purchased this from Zen Direct Inc.  It arrived in a timely fashion and I used it once to heat a cup of water.  It is the right size for my kitchen counter as there is room in front of it to sit a cup or bowl.  It has a push button open, no annoying loud beeps, light stays on while cooking and while door is open, and it matches my white appliances. I also received an extra face plate so I can attach a new one if this one gets worn.  It is hard to read the small print on the controls so I will have to memorize them.  There are no one button starts, so to heat the water I hit beverage, then the #1 and Start.  It heated for 1.30 minutes.  Zen Direct sent me an oven that had a large dent on the top left rear corner.  I surmise it was dented before it was packaged as the packaging was intact.  I plan to keep it anyway as the dent does not appear to affect the door seal and sending it back would be another hassle.  I am expecting good results from the oven, the three stars is for the dent.  I suppose Zen Direct deals in seconds but sell as new which I have found other companies to do as well and is the down side of buying on-line.  ."
2,The handle is broken
1,Product gets too hot. Not safe to use. Must replace for safety.
4,"Best thing about it, you can turn off that super annoying beeper.  God I hate those.I've had it for several months now and find the heating has been consistent.It doesn't make much noise.  You can hear the rollers of the turntable on occasion, since they are made of hard plastic, but it's not that big a deal.What I don't like is that there is no release trigger.  The door needs to forcefully be pulled open and closed.  I found if you put your thumb on the microwave, above the number pad, and use you fingers to pop open the door, no problem, but you still need to forcefully push the door closed.  By nature I'm a very quiet person and really don't like making noise doing this.The turntable seems to rotate at a random speed, so if you put something with a handle in, The handle will rarely be in the same position when it's done.  I think most microwave turntables take an even 10 seconds per rotation.  Not this one.Overall, not bad.  I really do love the no beep option.Edit:  The light started flickering.  Some people have said they've lost the light completely.  I emailed the address that is in my comment section and asked if I could fix it, and how.  They replied that they needed the model and serial numbers.  I couldn't find the serial number.  They sent the enclosed picture as a sample.  The serial number is on the side of the bump in back, same side as the cord.  The reason no one can see it is because of just that, it's on the same side as the cord.  People are not going to unplug the microwave and pull it away from the wall, they are going to pivot it to expose the back, leaving the cord largely unmoved, meaning that part of the back is not easily visible.  After submitting it, along with a recommendation to move it's placement to the other side, they sent me a refund check for the full price of the microwave and shipping, which I received in just a few days.  Nice of them, even though I just wanted to fix the light."
5,I love my new toshiba microwave it works amazing .Heats up everything very fast and hot.
1,"Worked great for the first couple of months, and then suddenly stopped working."
3,"Bought this unit as I like Panasonic's inverter technology. The unit works fine except that I often find myself having to hit the same keypad buttons multiple times before it registers. Would be a much better unit if it had real buttons, or some other interface."
3,"This is a great microwave oven and does a lot of things, however the highest temperature that it achieves on convection baking is around 300 degrees set on the highest setting of 425f"
5,This microwave is so nice in shape and size. It fits in the space allotted just perfectly.  My only disappointment is that the glass plate inside  came broken and I had to purchase a replacement.  Outside of that I love it.
3,"Box was delivered today 12-10-2022, box was delivered with obvious water damage, and the box was partially falling apart due to the water damage.  We, decided to give it a chance; most microwave/convection ovens are usually strong.  Will return if necessary"
1,"I bought this item only a few months ago and it hasn't worked properly in the past 3 months. To get anything remotely warm you need to put it on for at least 3 minutes, but if you are trying to actually warm up a whole meal, its like 5 or more minutes to get it warm. I don't understand why it works so horribly. Don't waste your money."
5,"It works just fine and I am sooooo happy to finally have a microwave that full-size dinner plates actually fit inside of! with no problems at all. It's a little noisier than my old one, but it's probably just because it's bigger...so it echoes a little more when running. I honestly don't care about that part though. All microwaves are noisy anyways...."
5,"So I recently moved into a small condo and while it did have a microwave, it sparked the first time I used it - scared the bejeezus out of me!! So my first thought - who doesn't have built in microwaves anymore (but it is an older condo) and what on earth size do I get? So I looked online and ended up getting a 1.1 cubic foot one... Well, that was huge. Didn't look good on the counter at all, too big, too bulky and heavy! So I returned that one and purchased this one. It arrived promptly and is a great size for a smaller countertop microwave. I've used it for 3 days now and it seems to do a great job. It isn't loud at all and does have the rotating glass in the center. Yes, it's smaller than you may be used to (but that is what I wanted) and it's not the extra high / fast power of some of the bigger models, but it sure does get the job done. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a good countertop microwave and doesn't need to cook overly large things. Good purchase!!"
4,Excellent microwave for its price...I don't like the control buttons though. I actually had to read the manual to learn how to use the thing... that's not good UX design. And the buttons aren't that easy to press.
4,Big enough for standard dinner size plates
3,"It cooks well and evenly. On the downside, you have to have the manual handy to know how to program it for shortcut cooking and defrosting. It does not have quick cook buttons meaning you cannot push 2 for an automatic 2 mins of cook. Also, it shows fingerprints. I would not buy this model again."
2,Given the stated watts it microwaves much slower than other brands with lower stated wattages. VERY Sad about that as that was the whole reason we bought it.
5,I have so far only used the microwave function since I have a dedicated air fryer and I haven’t yet needed the broiler function. I like the build quality. I did need to learn new controls as compared to a simple microwave. The height was perfect for my shelf and the extra unit depth was not an issue for my location.
1,I bought this microwave a few months ago and it was doing fine up until a week ago. It just completely stopped working. I have done troubleshooting as well as reached out to about 3 different people on how to get this problem fixed. It cost a good amount of money and for it to just stop working out of no where is insane.
4,Working great
5,This is a very nice microwave. Would recommend to anyone.
4,"We are doing a kitchen remodel and needed an inexpensive microwave to use during construction. It works great. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles as some, but it gets the job done."
5,A great microwave for a small space! also seems great for RV and dorm room use!
1,I purchased this item two months ago.  Last week it began to beep and then turn off.  I restarted it (turned back on) several times but it kept turning off.  Apparently there is a short or the circuit board is defective. I have spent three days with Black & Decker warranty people who won't accept my documentation that I own the machine.  I am getting a run around.  I give up.  The defective machine goes in the trash and I will purchase another brand.
5,The media could not be loaded.It works really well.
3,The door doesn’t open automatically. I have to pry. It open
5,"For years I've fought with Microwaves that have power levels but instead pulse the power through. While in most instances, this is still manageable... I did not realize just what I was missing by buying cheap microwaves without the Panasonic technology. I am able to defrost or reheat all variety of items without causing uneven heating or the cooking  of the ends of an item I am defrosting.I am not a big fan of microwaves, infact, before purchasing this I subjected my wife to two years of no microwave at all. It was an effort to make sure that we were cooking more, and cooking proper amounts to avoid wasting food. Never again, now I do not have to plan days in advance to defrost things that come out of my freezers. I just stick it in, wait 5 minutes, and it is ready to be cooked without any sign of being defrosted in a microwave.I cannot stress the difference between other microwaves and one with this Panasonic Inverter technology. The hype (there is not much) is real."
4,Clock doesn't work. I went online with a Toshiba tech guy and we went over the simple steps together. We couldn't get it to work and tech guy suggested I send it back and get a replacement unit. Not going to do that as I rarely look at the microwave clock but it is disappoijting. Everything else including timers works great.
1,Bought in August 2021.  Throws sparks and died already.  I guess you get what you pay for.
5,It works great
4,"Very nice product and seems to work well despite the cover being damaged. Apparently done at factory as there was no damage to packaging. Would return, but hard for Senior to re-box and handle."
3,Guessing the delivery ppl dropped it. Doesnt shut correctly or heat food well.
1,Microwave take forever to heat up food. It’s a good size for limited counter space but the usual 1minute 30 seconds will not do to heat any food. I sometimes have to double and triple heat food. Tried 2 minutes on a regular size plate and the food was still cold so I tried 2 minutes again and it was still cold so I tried again snd it eventually got warm. The power button doesn’t work on the one I got so there’s no adjusting or knowing what setting it’s on.
3,I’m very happy with everything except for the fact that I have to wipe it down after every use. Every fingerprint is visible.
4,"I haven't had this microwave long, about two weeks, but it has performed admirably during that time. I can't comment on its reliability, but I can on its features and functionality. It's small so it fits in my very limited kitchen space. It's 900W so it doesn't tend to blow out fuses in an antiquated electrical system. It is well lit, easy to use and does exactly what I want and expect. Its minor flaw has to do with the turntable. The plate is easily dislodged from the dead center so that it doesn't turn as it should if that happens. The first time that happened I thought I had a defective unit. The turntable looks to be centered when it isn't. After closer examination, I found the problem and am now very careful when placing something it the unit. If I bump the plate in the slightest, I carefully watch to make sure it's turning. Other than that, I am a very happy man. Inexpensive, attractive, easy to use, does exactly what I want."
3,So I used to have Nu Wave. I was expecting that plus a microwave as well. The appliance is good. It's nice and pretty.  It's just not what I thought I was getting.  I've missed my return window by a few days. That's always my luck. I need a cooking profile. It doesn't come with one. Just a few pieces of paper. The warranty card. A quick startup guide.That's just about it.
1,"Worked fine for ~3 years until this week when, 8 seconds into microwaving some water in a microwave-safe cup, I saw ~6 INCH FLAME shooting out from one of the microwave's interior walls. I've never seen a microwave do something like this."
4,works well but a little loud
4,Compact in size so takes up small space.  One touch button works great.  Don’t need to manually enter time. Noise level is okay but I would personally like little less noise. Still Overall a great product.
5,"Wonderful purchase for a very small space over our cabinet. We were limited by the depth of the shelf and appreciated the clear measurements and other reviews provided for this product which really helped us make our decision.All in all, a great purchase! Don't let the size parameters fool you -- the interior of this microwave is big enough for everything! Fits our large dinner plates, popcorn bags and everything else we need to reheat."
5,"We had to replace the Micro in our Breakroom. Wow what a difference, Nice shiny, clean, and Quiet!It fit perfectly in the little space...A+++++"
4,"Like all new appliances, you just have to get used to them. After a few weeks I'm comfortable with it.  This one replaced a 27 year old one. It's a little quieter, a lot quicker, and I like the stainless steel look.  Hoping the buttons hold up. The start button gets used the most and it's a little softer than it was at the beginning. We'll see."
5,This microwave is a perfect fit to replace Thermador built in microwaves. Full featured and well built. Auto reheat mode is particularly good.
1,"Bought as high end gift for my mother.After infrequent use over 2 months, the protective seal on the control panel began coming apart.Contacted Amazon offers to pay for upgrade but was told had to deal with Panasonic and was forwarded their USA customer helpline and email address.Contacted both repeatedly with zero response so gave up.Needless to say VERY disappointing"
1,"We were super happy to finally replace the old Microwave today, BUT, as it turns out the control panel faceplate is not attached at the base of the unit! Looks like a quality control issue from Toshiba. Literally just unpacked it plugged it in and noticed this issue. It weighs a lot and is a chore to unpack and now I have to try to pack it back up to return it!  Bummed out."
5,"I have this microwave inside a cabinet above my oven. When I turn on the microwave, I have to keep checking back to be sure I did so because it's so quiet. I'd buy another Toshiba."
4,Unit works as it should. If you are planning to cook a bag of standard size popcorn or anything larger… look elsewhere this is not the micro your looking for.
5,"I didn't go looking for a microwave with a dark grey interior, but who knew how great that would be!  The start button is one touch 30 seconds, the 1-6 buttons are one touch minute buttons.  Nice handle and not that annoying pop open button that scoots the microwave all over.  Reheats beautifully, plenty of power.  Nice looking too."
1,"I purchased This RCA microwave RMW733-Black 700 watt in Nov 2017. It is dead 7 months later.It was a waste of money! I should of spent the extra 30-40 bucks to get a better one.It is a very small apartment/dorm size microwave. Not for a family of 4 who will be using it often. It does takes a long time to heat things ( 700 watt) the glass turntable constantly falls off the track and will not stay level in the middle as it should.You can not cook a bag of popcorn without it getting stuck ( won’t spin) the single sever bag are fine but not reg size they get stuck and burn.This microwave is good for heating up small snacks, water, soup, and such. Not good for defrosting meat."
2,"The description said stainless steel!  There is a 1 inch border around the face of the micro wave that is the only stainless steel on this microwave.  I believe that is false advertising!  If you are looking for a cheap microwave that does an alright job, then by all means you can purchase this microwave!  If you are looking for a high quality stainless steel microwave that actually has stainless steel on it, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
5,"Size  is great for my space, looks good and functions just like larger ones except smaller..."
1,"During the short time it operated it was fine and I would have given it an excellent review. However when I attempted to heat a frozen entree the evening of November13, a few seconds after I pushed the start button, there was a minor explosion! The microwave started buzzing, sparks were flying, and the food flew  all over the interior and started flaming. Of course I immediately unplugged so it would stop. The food that was flaming took a few seconds to extinguish on it's own.There was nothing metal in the microwave that could have caused this and since this is the usual thing I have been using the microwave for without a problem I don't know what would have caused this reaction other than it being defective.I haven't requested a replacement or reimbursement yet, but I will update this review with information about how Amazon handled this situation when I get a resolution from them."
4,"I do not understand why heating a dinner plate of food takes 8 minutes!?!  In my world I put left overs on a ‘dinner’ plate not raw food.The items to chose for the micro are generally for reheating. Well, I found it difficult to figure out the designers meaning of the buttons."
2,"If you don't have two hands free, this is NOT for you. Buttons are very difficult to push, and the plastic covering the buttons is already peeling. It works just fine, but it is NOT easy to use."
4,Good microwave but the buttons are kind of hard to press
4,"It's nice and quiet & seems to work well.  We've only had it for a few weeks.  The only problem is that the letters and numbers on the control panel are not bright enough and I have to use a light to read them.  There was no answer in the instructions as to how to brighten them, so that's life."
3,"This oven was fine, but it caught fire for no apparent reason. Only owned it for 2 years."
4,"The damned buttons on the thing are so stiff that when you push the buttons, the whole microwave slides away. It's so annoying. Like 40 years of this particular technology and you mfs can't come up with a way to make the buttons useable without having to hold it in place with the other hand?Otherwise, it's a decent microwave. Simple. Easy to use. Works well."
3,"The oven arrived 5 days after ordering.  Thanks Amazon!  Nice looking appliance.  However the instruction manual is awkward, almost incomprehensible.  Obviously written by someone with poor command of English.  Examples:  ""The reheat food can be covered with the lid.""  ""Reheat food is dinner plate.""  ""The sensor will sound twice when the steaming is emanated.""  I might give the microwave a higher rating if The instructions on how to operate it were clearer."
1,Too small.  Return it.  Nice for someone in college or something.
5,"This was purchased for an elderly woman with limited space within an assisted living facility.If you are looking for a smaller unit to primarily heat / reheat food on an average-sized dinner plate, warm a beverage quickly etc. this microwave is perfect. The speed in which it heats items of this size is on par with higher powered units. It's also quite quiet.There isn't a learning curve for basic heating.  Many microwaves require the user to push multiple buttons in a certain order just for simple heating, but this one is easy and to the point. While that's a bonus for anyone, it's  definitely a big help for someone with memory / process challenges."
5,"I was very apprehensive about spending this much on a microwave, but I'm glad I did. This microwave is also a toaster oven and has an air fryer and it's super easy to use. So practical to save cabinet space too. It's large but only takes up one space instead of 3 separate ones. If you're thinking about it, just do it! We love it. It's also soooo quiet! My only complaint if I had one would be that you can't set a timer for the oven while the microwave is in use."
5,"I would like the price to be less than I paid for the oven, otherwise I am well pleased"
1,Showed up non functional. Door just wouldn’t open. Seemed like it was made like crap in China like everything else these days. Instant return total garbage.
5,"Me encanta para espacios pequeños, cumple su función"
5,"The sleek and modern design fits perfectly under my countertop cabinets, giving my kitchen an upgraded look. As someone who primarily uses the microwave to warm up food, the basic settings are all I really need and they work perfectly. What pleasantly surprised me was the comprehensive manual that came with the microwave.I actually took the time to read it and discovered a multitude of advanced features that I didn't even know existed. The eco mode is impressive, allowing me to save energy while efficiently heating my food. Additionally, the microwave is equipped with several functions that my older model didn't have, making it even more convenient to use."
1,I've been trying to figure out how do I contact them for the longest.... When I first purchased this microwave it was working fine but like the next week it just started going down... It takes almost 10 minutes for a cup of water to get hot it's a shame. All microwavable food takes extremely too long to heat up....
1,"Dislike this microwave it takes double the time to do the job it is supposed to.It is very small, and that is what I needed for the space I have. I would not recommend."
5,We have it at the office about a month and are loving it. To be fair it replaced a 10+ year old microwave that was decaying so anything new would probably excite us.
4,"I have owned a great 1980's GE that had a rotating beam rather than a turntable, expensive at that time but lasted for over 25 years.  Several replacement GE and Sharp units that worked fine but failed prior to or just months after warranty expiration.  GE was my go to brand but have been disappointed by their expensive Profile range, a toaster oven and microwaves since they have been owned by Chinese.  Nothing against the country or people as Panasonic is also made in China, along with my LG TV.My research for this microwave in 2020 led me to Panasonic or Toshiba as the best rated microwaves available.This is the only countertop WHITE one I could find other than two GE models and a Whirlpool that had several review complaints that were consistent.  Never liked the industrial/commercial look of stainless steel in home kitchen appliances; and they don't offer avocado anymore...lol.The reason for just 4 stars....just got it and I miss the one button to run for 30 seconds; this one requires three button presses to warm up my coffee....sounding like a George Jettson complaint (ask another boomer if you don't understand that).It arrived two days prior to scheduled delivery, in perfect condition, runs nice and quietly, and hopefully will last longer than the 3 year protection plan I also purchased given my luck with prior microwaves.Will update this review when it fails or makes it to 2023......""Back in the days""  I would never purchase a protection plan on electronics as they would usually fail within the warranty period or run for years...those days are gone!"
5,This looks very nice on my counter and many features very good buy
2,The microwave is noisy. Slow to heat. It broke down in less than two years.
5,Great microwave!  Looks pretty on kitchen counter.
2,"I've been using this model for a little over 6 months now, and have to say I'm not loving it. I had a 10-year-old KitchenAid over-stove model that worked better than this.The three areas that are not working for me are:1) Uneven heating, and heating the container, but not the food - Every time I use this, the plate or dish holding the food gets blazing hot, but the food is just warm. Sometimes the dish is so hot I can't even take it out of the oven, and the food is just barely warm. These are just standard ceramic dishes.2) Uneven defrosting. My old KitchenAid did an amazing job of defrosting everything. With this model, if I'm defrosting a chicken breast, the inside will still be frozen, and the edges are completely cooked.3) Lastly, the construction quality is not what I would expect for a $200+ microwave oven. The lever you push to open the microwave door is cheap plastic and squeaks loudly every time I open the oven door. I imagine eventually it will just give out and break.Again, overall, not really pleased with this purchase. I'll probably end up giving it to one of my kids and try another KitchenAid model."
5,"Fits in my small kitchen perfectly. The first thing I did was turn the beep off! Yes! A quiet, cute little cooker!"
3,"I ordered this product to replace my NN-SU686S Panasonic microwave, because I had cracked the front glass.  I was perfectly happy with that microwave.So, I started the hunt and read all reviews and tried to make the best choice and select something the same, if not better than my NN-SU686S.  Listed below are the things I am unhappy with:* Interior light is too dim to light up the interior.* Interior is gray, which makes it all the more dark.  (I really prefer a white interior.)* Led display - This is a COUNTER height microwave, but when standing in front of it and viewing the LED display, the characters at the top of the screen are cut off.  I have to lean down and get my head more level with the display to see the tops of the numbers.* Button to open the door is loosey goosey* It runs rather loudly* Even though my previous microwave was 1100 watts and this is 1200 watts, this new microwave takes longer to heat the same items* When an item completes heating (time runs out), when I check the item and close the door and press the keys to add more time, it will not allow me to do this.  Instead, I have to actually press ""clear"" to enter the new time, even though the previous cycle was successfully completed.  Extra key strokes...many times a day...really adds up.I do like that the sides are silver and the front design is attractive.  Also, it has a smaller exterior but the same interior size as my old microwave, which is great.I wanted to return it the first day...but I have decided to try and get used to it.  The reason for the review is so that the Panasonic peeps might pay attention to these serious flaws.  Next time...I will make sure I watch for these problems before buying."
3,The only thing I dislike is that the controls take a very heavy touch to work
5,Super compact but still fits a normal size dinner plate. Fits nicely in a very small space.
3,Have only used two of it's uses.  No instructions were included so I have to look those up online.  Overheats quickly but it does microwave nicely.  Very small interior/
2,"I liked the microwave at first, but it just broke down.  I only had the microwave for 2 years and we didn’t even use it on a daily basis!  We just used it to warm up food.  Now, it has an electrical issue.  I put the food in, set the time, and pressed start.  It started and then the power cut off.  This happened a couple of times.  I unplugged it and plugged it in again.  It then worked, but didn’t sound like usual.  The last time this happened, It turned itself on and the display showed 8888.  So, I unplugged it to prevent a possible fire.  I’m not taking a chance.  My last microwave lasted over 10 years!  I’m really disappointed in Panasonic. It used to be a reliable company."
2,Mine must have a circuit board issue. It turnes on as soon as the door is closed and stays on until the door is opened or it is unpluged
1,"The description on the site is wrong... it says white with platinum,  it more like stainless steel... the biggest shocker was that it's completely black inside.... maybe that's teflon, I don't know just never seen a black interior before.  so far, only had it a day it seems to work o.k. 2nd day in operation... heating 2 bowls of oatmeal... it started smoking inside like it was about to catch fire... called Farberware and they said retirn"
2,It was a great microwave while it lasted. A microwave should not stop working after such a short period of time
1,"Light flashes and makes a static-like sound, not all the time, but enough to worry.  Did not start until the return window closed, of course (30 days).  Amazon said we could send it back, but we have to find a box and return to UPS.  Feel like Farberware should give us a voucher for a box from UPS.  We like the oven and may try one more - if the second one is defective, we're done with Farberware."
2,"Not bad, but you get what u pay for. In a “normal” microwave it takes 70 sec to warm up milk, in this one it took like 2-3 min to get the same warmth.."
5,"This microwave is nice, small and quiet; you can barely hear it when it is warming food (my last microwave was big and very loud)! The compact size of this Bla k & Decker microwave left me with 8-10inches on my counter than my old microwave, that was a big plus, too. I'm happy with my purchase."
4,Easy to use. Low power and requires longer times to cook. Fits into small space which was important for us.
2,"I have an exact 30 inch gap for over the range microwaves, this should have fit if it in 29.88 inches.  It didnt fit by about an inch.  The size is inaccurate as posted."
5,"I purchased this microwave for one of my job's lunchrooms/kitchens. It is small, but heats up food quickly. This was a great purchase. 👍🏾"
4,"The microwave function of this oven works just fine. The convection function has definite limitations. I had read somewhere that a 9x13"" pan would fit inside,  so that is one of the reasons I chose this model. Unfortunately, though the pan does fit inside, I have not used it because the instruction book says the turntable MUST be used during baking, but the size will not allow the pan to rotate. Consequently I have only used round or 9x9"" square pans for baking. Also, the oven takes a LONG time to preheat. Otherwise, I am happy with it."
1,"I ordered this microwave in August & about a month later, the inside hook broke. Unfortunately, it’s past the return date. Hoping it can be fixed."
4,Smaller than expected.
5,"This arrived in less than two days! The front is not mirrored like the picture but besides that I am very happy with it. It is small and not the most powerful out three but I'm only using out to reheat leftovers and coffee! So far I'm very happy with it. Also, no problem with opening the door as other reviewers have mentioned"
5,I like the microwaves size. Great for one plate or bowl without extra space to get dirty while you cook. Doesn't take up near the counterspace my older one did.
3,It’s the perfect size - but you should note in your product description that you have to pry door open with both hands - there is no push release for the door. Terminal flaw by design engineers. Just sayin…
1,Microwave is so lightweight that it easily moves around.Never consistently cooks. If I make a bag of popcorn at 1.5 minutes it burns but the next bag set at 1.5 minutes will not be popped completely.Not very powerful as it statesOverall just not a good microwave. Wish I would have paid a little more for a better one.
4,very nice chrome finish just very dark and not well lit inside once turned on. Feel like I need to flash a flashlight to see my food once inside.
5,"Per all these reviews, yes, it may take a little figuring out how to effectively use this microwave because it is such a workhorse, and you need to read carefully at first (don't removed the glass turn table for any type of cooking; use the high rack for air fry, the low one for broiling), but a guide is affixed to the inside of the door for easy reference, and there is a full, detailed online manual and recipe collections on the GE website. You can select any cook time from one second and there are auto functions for various cooking methods. I am wowed at how well this works for general use, and also as an air fryer (15 minutes was the time it took to air fry a pan full of panko crusted shrimp from Costco), and broiler (a big time saver for heating up/crisping up some bbq ribs). Fast, quiet, and an optimum performance for melting, cooking, popping, and thawing, but also makes super-crisp foods in record time. This multi-use microwave also looks really nice. So glad I chose this microwave!"
3,"I was very happy to find this microwave that supposedly is made in Japan; but when it came, ""Made in China"" was printed right on the box.  Shame on Toshiba for posting incorrect information on their website!"
1,"Initially returned a defective microwave that was sent to me, second microwave also defective, and still a third was returned because UPS said they had a slip for both microwaves. UPS came with two slips to pick up 2 microwaves and took both items the defective one and one I hadn’t even opened to check or use. Called customer service to get a refund on the item and was told I had to wait three weeks for my refund. I am a retired nurse living on a fixed income and needed the microwave to heat up food for myself, my family and my pet. Now I have no microwave and have to wait almost three weeks for a refund so I can buy another. Terrible systems refund process and godawful customer service from Amazon."
1,"I bought this literally one year ago this week. The button to open the door is broken, making it impossible to open the door. Poor quality."
1,"I was pleased with the size and read the instructions which included that I could  use paper towels...which I did once as it caught on fire much to my surprise. Spent a good while trying to clean it to no avail so have bought another Panasonic, which I always used paper towels in  and will try to return this one."
5,I stopped buying Sharp Carousel because they chose to make their models without an inside light that comes on when you open the door. This B & D model is a great replacement and is larger than Sharp.
5,"Our microwave died out of the blue, and we spent a good week researching microwaves to replace it. This one from Panasonic was highly rated by consumer advocacy groups and customers alike, and in the last two months it has worked perfectly for us. It did take some adjustment as this one cooks at a higher wattage than our old one, so if you are upping the wattage by buying this, make sure you alter the cooking times! Since buying this, we've noticed that a lot of products only list cook times for microwaves up to 1000 watts, nothing higher. This one cooks at 1200 watts, and that five minute cook time for our old 1000 watt microwave is now two and a half, maybe three minutes, with this new one.The interior of this microwave is large, and that's wonderful. Two six inch plates can fit side by side on the glass platter with no worries of bumping the sides of the microwave. The big size also means that if a plate or item is covered by a napkin or paper towel, the napkin or paper towel won't bump the side of the microwave and get knocked off the top of the plate and allow food to splatter. The timer end beep is plenty loud to hear if you leave the kitchen.The one thing we don't like about this microwave is that when you press the 30 second button it doesn't start automatically. You also can't press the Start button to have the microwave go for 30 seconds. These were features on our old one that we miss with this new one. Other than this, this has been a great purchase. Our old microwave made it through six moves, three states, and ten years. Here's hoping this one does the same."
5,"Bought this to replace the same size microwave in our boat that failed.  It works much better, is quieter, and seems to draw less power from our system.  The turntable feature is especially nice in a microwave this small."
1,Defective - the swing door sealed panel seal leaking. Moisture forms every use and then after one hour dries out.There should be NO moisure formation INSIDE the sealed door panel. The moisture forming inside the machine space if normal but NOT inside the sealed door panel. May be the seal is faulty.
1,"This is the largest turntable with inadequate motor power which is defective and cheapest microwave you will ever purchase.  Lasted only 10 months when you usually have to throw them out before they break, like 20 yrs.  Called Amazon customer service 888- 280-4331 and said tough luck and that the customer (me) has to contact Panasonic myself and fight with them over this as it clearly states on Amazon specs it has a 1 year warranty on parts and labor.  Customer reviewers have repeatedly stated dealing with Panasonic customer service is a nitemare.  I am debating whether to try and somehow contact Panasonic or just file with the California States Attorney General and Better Business Bureau.  You would be surprised how successful this is...... You need a large motor for the largest turntable you will ever see.  It has the cheapest door which clangs loud every time you close it.  It is obvious this was made to minimal standards.  Poorly engineered, the plastic see thru pops out if you move or press on the front of the microwave.  Please save time and money and forget this piece of junk.  I am out $ 184 dollars.  Update,  Amazon gave me full refund.  I think they are still selling this...always amazed at products that are soooo inferior, yet continue to be sold.  I guess if you sell one and return two you are still making money because it cost  20 bucks to make.  HA Ha Ha"
3,"OK, noisy, has most features, incl Time Defrost. Only feature I would really like to see is ""Add 30 Seconds"" cooktimeTurntable OK, but is is a small microwave"
4,I recently had to replace my older Panasonic microwave. Even tho they are the same size and power rating my old model was preferable to the new one. There are too many unneeded settings and I like the older push button keypad better than the touch keys. They both cook equally as well.
4,"I like Panasonic microwaves, just don't buy them on Amazon. I bought 2 of them both arrived broken.  the first looked like a manufacturing defect. The second had the box and microwave caved in.  Amazon was awesome on the return refund thing.  Bought one at Sam's Club.  I like the inverter technology.  It doesn't just turn on/off it actually lowers power for more even results.  It has all the sensor settings and is easy to clean. I think I burned out my old Panasonic Microwave by not having it on its own circuit.  It still lasted several years."
4,Bought for my daughter's  kitchen.  She loves it.
5,I love this microwave and it heats up in less the time then my 700 watt
5,It is good quality and really works as expected. Not so strong but it si quite ok for small spaces and heating lunch boxes during lunch breaks. I recommend this product for small space offices.
2,Make sure to get the warranty. Mine barely made it to 3 years use before it died. Too bad I didn’t get a warranty!!
2,Surprised and disappointed to find this too small for microwave popcorn.  The bag touches the sides and can’t rotate. Popcorn gets part burned and part unpopped. Found this out too late to return. 😕
1,"Liked the unit well enough but after only 3 months it just started ARC-ing.  There was a stick of butter in it with paper wrapper on it was all...  confirmed failure with more trys.  Sadly, this is the second micro to do the same thing only first one lasted a year.  Reading about GE model also made in China, looks identical and people reported same phenomenon and at about 3 months too.  Well past 30 days so this was really a very expensive unit... no return or recourse available...."
5,Great oven.  Food really comes out good.  Very easy to use  because the buttons are easy to read.  Noise level is not so bad.  Not really that loud so it should not bother you.  This oven is so convenient it's the greatest.  Would recommend.
2,While heating food the fan starts to slow down within a few seconds.
1,I can hardly believe the quality of the construction of this little microwave… The control panel appeared to be possibly glued into place… And fell off immediately when I took it out of the box! How sad! I really don’t have any more energy to put into my review of this pathetic little unit!
2,Don’t waist your money on this one.
1,This microwave only worked for 3 months.  I then discovered that Panasonic requires defective items be sent far away for repair.  The process is slow and tedious.  We have been without a microwave while we wait.
1,"I was very disappointed by this microwave:(…. It cooked horribly and would not stay connected to Wi-Fi.  I tried several different things to figure out the cooking issues.  Nothing worked.  As far as the wifi connection issues, I moved the microwave around and even set my wireless router right next to it…. Nothing but issues.  Very in a inexpensive but I would not recommend it for purchase."
4,Only bad thing it is very loud.
2,Broken when we received.  Dented stainless steel and front glass was shattered.
5,"I wanted a smaller microwave to save counter space and I don't think I'll ever need one bigger than this anyway. It takes, maybe an extra minute or minute and a half to heat as much as my old big one but that's fine. It works well, it's quiet, and it looks good."
2,Smaller than I expected for the pricing
3,Heating food and tea
2,I previously owned an Amazon basics microwave that was perfect. I would type in times like 99 and 20 all the time. With this microwave you have to first press the time cook button before you can enter in the time. just annoying extra step. And the buttons are less sensitive than the previous microwave I own so you really have to press them firmly.
1,"This microwave stopped working at 6 1/2 months.  It was purchased on 25 Feb 2020.  I am not a frequent user of the microwave so it does not get daily use. My 16yo son went to heat something up this evening, 17 Sep 2020, the microwave light was working, all buttons were working, the turntable was turning, but as he removed the item from the microwave it was just as cold as he had put the item into the microwave.  He called me into the kitchen to see if I could help.  (Cause Mom can fix anything, right?)  I looked at the microwave to see if maybe I could.  NOPE!! Nothing!!  The heating element is out.  I come back to my Amazon Order History knowing it was a relatively recent purchase only to find out my ""Product Assistance"" ran out on 25 Aug 2020.  What a disappointment!!SO...I am out my money from a purchase I made only 6 months ago and now I have to purchase a new one.  HMMM...will I make a purchase like this from Amazon again?....NOPE!"
5,I like the product but was very displeased that the first delivery was not delivered like you said and I had to talk to customer service twice to finally receive the GE Microwave.  I believe someone received a free microwave on that first delivery.
1,Would like to return...does not work  # 7 up does not work; if I want to warm something more than 6 minutes I am out of luck...poor quality
2,"While this microwave is powerful unit, the control panel is so dim that we have to use a flashlight to see what we’re pushing. Extremely annoying and GE should not get by with such cheap mechanics , save your money and buy one that has a better control display"
2,"I have only had this since feb of this year, it has a burning smell when using. I am not paying shipping under the limited one year warranty to possibly not get a replacement for $100 item. Not worth possibly catching house on fire or causing smoke damage to the kitchen."
2,"I bought this to replace my 24-year old Goldstar microwave (which was still working but it was discolored and I thought I get a newer, more efficient one).  Problems with his item: 1) The unit is so light weight that it is not possible to shut the door without moving the whole microwave It stops only when the back counter wall stops it.  2) The glass dish does not have indents to catch the rotation mechanism. It is smooth so when the mechanism spins, the glass is not gripped & held in place.  It doesn't stop the microwave from performing but it's a poor design.  3) The instructions to set the clock are not accurate.  Low quality for the money."
5,"Bought this microwave to replace a similar, but older model that had worked well for many years.  Have found Panasonic microwave to be reliable and easy to use.  Last one was the first model I have had trouble with after about 8 years.  Two others are still working, one approximately 25 years old and the other about 12 years old.  Apparently, this last one had a bad relay inside the unit.  I was able to fix it for minimal costs, but wanted a backup unit in case this problem ever happened again.  This one operates in the same way and has been working great.  Some minor design changes, but mostly updates to newer technology."
3,It’s a microwave. It works. What else is there to know?
5,"First off, I hate reading instruction books. I did have the book handy when I first turned this on, but later found I didn’t need it. Same goes for the design. Pull the handle, door opens…push the handle, door closes. I got the impression that this is going to last. It seems well put together and the simple operation gives one confidence that the designer knew this from the start. Recommended."
1,"Usually stops working midway through the defrost cycle. Will randomly just stop working at other times as well. Just goes off, and then the clock will need to be reset every time. Even if it did work reliably, it generates so much interference that any devices that aren't 5G lose internet connection, which is about half of the devices in our home. So if a kid is doing online school we can't microwave anything, which makes life tough with three kids all on different schedules. Took us a while to figure out why they kept dropping internet when other devices did not. Have never had a microwave that did this, but they claim it happens in the instruction book. So beware. The keyboard numbers are just a sticker sheet, that after a month is now bubbling and peeling off.  My last microwave (Sharp) similar size and wattage, had a quick button, just press start for one minute. This one only has a 30 second button, and you have to hit start also. So not that quick, and 30 seconds is useless,  doesn't heat anything, not even water for tea. For a minute you have to hit 30 sec twice, then start, or just 1 0 0 start. So basically, no quick setting. Popcorn is a pain, can't use default or it burns. The popcorn settings are weight presets, with 3.0, 3.5, and 1.75 oz. But the big name brand bags we like are 3.29 oz. So it either burns or doesn't pop it all. And a second bag doesn't pop well after the first. Defrost setting cooks the food around the edges, and you can't select different foods. It also only gives a tiny sound to turn the meat, which is easy to miss, and then the food gets unevenly defrosted and cooked. But it sure gives you a long, annoying series of beeps when the cycle is done...of course, when everything is over and it's not important to do anything. On the plus side, the sensor cook works well for vegetables and potatoes, and it fits a 13x9 baking dish, which my big family needs. But so did my last microwave, which was about ten years old. So basically, we lost features, lost functionality, and got a machine that doesn't always work at all, can only be used when the kids aren't online, and takes more effort and babysitting to use than a similar item from ten years ago. Wish I could go back in time and buy something else."
5,"This microwave oven replaced the one I had that stopped functioning recently.  And it works great!  The heating/cooking capacity of it is superior to the one I had since the food rarely splatters, if at all, from localized overheating.  My previous oven used to make soups, leftover dinner food, and the like splatter during operation so much that it would knock the paper towel I placed over the food out of place, thereby defeating the towel's purpose to prevent splattered food in the oven.  Now, I still use a paper towel placed over the food I am reheating or cooking, but I don't have the splatter problem anymore with this new Black & Decker microwave oven.  It must have better overall microwave technology, providing a more uniform heating and cooking capacity.  I do like this microwave oven, so I do recommend this brand to anyone who needs a new microwave oven."
4,It's good .. heats from inside out but is very noisy
5,I broke my roommates microwave tray trying to wash it in the sink and this was cheaper than purchasing a new tray.
4,"Pretty decent little microwave. Cooks 30% slower than an average full sized microwave and uses 1170 watts to do it. Apparently it’s standard to list an appliances wattage while operating on the lowest setting, which makes sense if you’re only concerned with utility costs but if you’re planning to power it with solar, peak consumption is what matters most. Don’t expect a 1500 watt inverter to live long powering a 700 watt microwave if you need it to do more than defrosting. Aside from running at 1200 watts this microwave has lasted about 2 years but the inverter failed to last a year. I use it once or twice a workday totaling about 5 minutes of runtime.Price was reasonable but at 1200 watts I think a larger capacity unit could have been had. Great for apartment or dorm rooms I use it in my work truck. easy to use and clean"
4,LIKE THE MICROWAVE ONLY WOULD LIKE FOR THE  PANEL TO HAVE A SOFT LIGHT BEHIND IT SO YOU CAN SEE THE TIME AND SO FORTH WITHOUT TURNING ON THE KITCHEN OVERHEAD LIGHT LIKE MY CUP OF TEA WITHOUT LETTING THE ANIMALS THINKING ITS TIME TO GET UP GO OUT AND EAT WHEN CAN'T SLEEP AND GET UP AT 3-4 AM  ALSO WOULD LIKE INFORMATION ON HOW TO OPERATE THE AIR FRYER AND USE THE GRILL PART OF THE MICROWAVE IF YOU HAVE ANY INFO PLEASE SEND IT TO ME
3,I like the microwave except for the fact that there is no popcorn button.
4,You have to push the keypad too hard. Feels cheap but heats decent enough.
1,The top and back of the microwave cover  was extremely hot to the touch after just three minutes of boiling water in a microwave safe measuring cup.. And tbe microwave was very noisy. Sadly I had to return the product.
5,I questioned a 700 watt microwave at first but changed my mind quickly. Easy to use short cuts to reheat beverages.
3,"Occassionally, this microwave goes Rogue. It sometimes decides to ignore my commands and displays what it decides. The Express cook sometimes won't work. Otherwise, on good days it works perfect!"
5,I've had it for over a year and I have had no problems whatsoever
1,"Do not buy this microwave if you want a clock that works. The issue is that the time won’t stop changing back after I have manually changed it. Ever since daylight savings the clock has been an hour ahead. When I go and manually set the clock back an hour it will keep the new time for a bit, but then the time magically jumps back forward after a few hours. After reading through the questions and other reviews on here and looking at a few other online forms it appears that I am not the only person with this issue. Multiple other people have been reporting this same problem and there is still no provided solution, every time the company just says to manually fix it, disregarding the fact that people have told them they already tried that and it just keeps changing back.In all honesty while the microwave not having the correct time isn’t the end of the world (there are other devices on my kitchen that tell the time, and I have a watch on, and I have my phone) it’s still just a frustrating bug in the system that the company is will not fix. It’s just annoying to always look at the time and then have to remind myself that it is wrong. It’s also frustrating that even when I manually change it the microwave will just go back to the wrong time after a few hours. I do not recommend this microwave at all. Get a better one."
2,Calienta poco
5,This microwave is JUST WHAT I WANTED!!The description of product is EXACTLY CORRECT!Works great and looks nice!!I’m soooo happy!!
3,I do not like the sticky door latch.
2,"Boilling on the edges, frozen in the middle.  I feel like I went backwards with this microwave."
3,Its okay for the price. It's pretty lightweight but it's a gorgeous appliance. Not happy with the timer setting but perfect if you are only needing to do the basic microwaving of food.
5,"Works great, got a loud peeper to let you know when your food is ready. Easy to use controls. And the Red color is extra nice"
3,"Our review of the Toshiba microwave we have purchased reciently, model EM-45P(BS). While I don't know of other models this perticular model has a design flaw that I feel needs to be addressed, also that potential customers should be made aware of. The tempered outer glass on the door overhangs past the edge the door itself leaving two of the corners vulnerable too the the slightest tap that result's in the glass shattering. I know why the glass is so fragile at the corners. That is where all the tention is. I know this due to my work in the solar industry. So after spending over $150.00 dollars Toshiba personally informed us that there was nothing they could do for what was at one time their customers. All we wanted was a replacement door shipped to us even if we had to purchase it ourselves. I will say that the customer representative was professional they seemed to have a bit of a devil may care attitude. Needless to say we are no longer Toshiba customers any more."
5,This works great quite don’t know why some people say it loud that looks to be different model but this one is quite looks great and priced well especially if you can find one open box if you don’t mind consmedic damage to it I don’t as long as it works great looks wonderful highly recommend this one great for small space fits right into my small counter and lower wattage if that something your looking for very happy with this one especially the price worth it for me.
5,Ad information was accurate. Microwave was a better price than in local stores. As cheap as having an old model repaired.  Looks good . Works well. Satisfied and good brand nsme
5,Nice design and compact size. Have only had a month but haven’t had any problems.
5,This is a nice looking and good functioning microwave.  It has a decent size cavity and it is 1000 watts of power.  That is not the strongest but it is much better than some of the smaller less powerful microwaves.  I like the auto menus and especially the child lock.  Like most microwaves this has many of the standard features.  The display is easy to read and a new feature that I have not seen before is the multiphase cooking.  This is where you can have multiple cooking cycles for one food.  The price seem reasonable if not inexpensive compared to similar items.
4,It is easy to use.
2,This takes 2x the time to warm food. It’s very weak. Regret purchasing!!!
5,"I really like my new microven. I use it to defrost and reheat. It has 2 defrost features. It's super easy to use and clean and its fits a regular size dinner plate. I have a small apartment and it take up hardly any space on my counter. Love, love it. And the price is great."
1,"Honestly, I had no issues with the microwave until it just randomly stopped heating things after only 8 months. Everything else works, even sounds like it's working, but it won't heat anything. Kiss my money goodbye, since it's past the return window."
5,"At first, I thought purchasing a lower power microwave would not produce the cooking and heating results I wanted.  But I was wrong.  This unit is not only super quiet but equally as powerful and convenient as any microwave I have owned.  It's good to get the most needed items for me at a very good price!  Thanks!Dana M. Kott"
2,"Realmente el microondas es muy fácil de usar y si tienes un espacio reducido es excelente, pero el microondas en realidad NO CALIENTA BIEN, para que los alimientos se calienten no basta ni con 3min. Realmente no se si sea el mío o le ha pasado algunas personas pero el que el vendedor me envío realmente no calienta"
5,Tengo 5 meses con el y funciona muy bien me encanta
4,Muy pequeño pensé que era más grande
5,It’s a microwave and it gets the job done
5,He loves it! He bought hot pockets and couldn't cook without a microwave.  This was perfect size and works wonderfully.  Very happy with purchase!
2,"I read many reviews about the almost invisible numbers on the panel. When i received the microwave, I have to agree with them. I could hardly read anything on the panel. Even the clock, it is so dimmed. Every time I use the microwave, I have to look at the panel from 10 different angles. It's so annoying and I have to return it. Otherwise, I like this microwave. Spacious, quiet, powerful. Too bad."
4,So far so good 2nd microwave ive. ever had my 1st lasted 23yrs hoping this last just as long
5,"I'd lived microwave-free for years and then one day decided to buy one on a whim. I didn't research at all and ended up with a small, underpowered thing that annoyed me to no end until I got rid of it during a move. Several months passed, and while I thought about getting another microwave (remember popcorn? not having to stand over a stove or turn on the oven to heat up leftovers? simply melting butter in a little bowl for a few seconds?) I was still resistant - they were so much more expensive than I remember them being and I felt overwhelmed by the whole process. Finally one day I sat down and decided to comb through page after page of Amazon listings, and page after page of reviews. I settled on this Black + Decker microwave, 0.9 cubic feet, 900 watts, very good price for a ""Like New"" version. It's worked well so far. Although I do have to adjust the time slightly for some packaged/frozen foods, it's not often enough to be annoying, and I never have to double the time as I did with my old microwave. It isn't particularly noisy, it's small enough to fit under the cabinets of my small kitchen, and it looks sleek. I'm an avid home cook and while I don't use my microwave everyday, when I do I'm glad that I have it."
2,"Inexpensive and quiet because they didn't include a working exhaust fan! Zero exhaust! You will need 2 to 6 sheets of paper towel EVERY TIME you use the microwave! This is another example of asinine greedy companies/CEOs blatantly squeezing ot every penny for profit. Read the reviews... light bulbs going out in a few months and a high number of breakdowns and fires. It doesn't surprise me with the ton of steam that gets trapped because I'd tee lack of a working exhaust fan.My older microwave, which I used over 20 years, only needed the lamp replaced ONCE and the ONLY times I had to use paper towels was for regular cleaning and the rare mishaps.I understand that the price, size, & wattage is very tempting, it's why i purchased it... but please learn from my mistake and but a different microwave, even if it costs a few dollars more. Which is better: half a microwave (no exhaust) for this price or a REAL microwave for $25 more????"
2,"I'd recommend purchasing a different microwave. Looks nice but takes twice almost twice as long as any product recommended cooking time. Also the spinning disk constantly popups off and has to be re-aligned, poor designed."
1,"The funny thing is that I purchased this microwave because I loved the way it looked....nice and sleek. As far as microwaves go, it does what it is supposed to and it does it well. My complaint is with the buttons. The ""Start/Stop"" button has completely worn through the plastic coating over it...AND I'VE ONLY HAD THIS MICOWAVE IN USE FOR A MONTH. There have only been two people using it, so it's not like the office microwave that goes through hell every day with hundreds of people pushing buttons on it. I would have been upset had it done this after a year...but it's been a month!!!  I can't return it because I ordered it at Christmastime before I moved...the box didn't even get opened until the end of February so it is out of the return period.  I've attached a photo of the torn plastic covering which is starting to do the same thing on the ""0"", the ""1"", the ""2"" and the ""3"" . By the way, I should note that this isn't a temporary protective plastic covering over the buttons...it can't be removed. Except in certain locations by apparently by using it....if you care about how your appliances look and you don't want one that looks like someone dripped something down the front of your microwave (at first I thought it was pancake batter or something similar and kept trying to wash it off), buy something else. This is driving me crazy even though I know it's not dirty!!!"
3,I made a mistake. The microwave is way smaller than I expected. The photos and videos were misleading about the size
1,"Worst microwave I’ve ever purchased. So much moisture build up. Gets moldy in corners and puddles under the glass plate. Started rusting and peeling after 1 year. Literally needs cleaned and dryer out after each use. Horrible quality, do not purchase"
2,"I don't like this microwave because it is very small and the plate does not stay put, there is no center holder just the rotating ring. I was expecting more of a mirror finish on the front as well and that was not the case with this one."
5,I have had this microwave for a few years and it still works perfect. I needed a small microwave to fit into center island and the power is strong.
1,Hard to see why this is top rated since it has died after only 15 months.  Sound like it’s going to explode when you turn it on.  I guess  things just don’t last.
2,"I purchased this microwave mostly because it received great reviews. It looks great, fits my small microwave cubby and has plenty of power. I heat a lot of frozen food and what it does not do, even with the turntable, is heat the food evenly. I have had items that were too hot to eat on the edges but still cold in spots in the center. Positioning the items on the edge of the carousel helps, but it doesn't fix the problem. I'm going to give this one away and try another one so it was a complete waste of money!"
4,The media could not be loaded.The microwave is great and pretty powerful for a small microwave ( we had much bigger ones)But the options panel doesn’t light up! This picture has a flash but without it you can’t see the options.Otherwise it’s great!
3,"Returned it. Did not like the appearance as it looked cheap. Size was good as were the feature but just didn’t suit me. Bought a smaller Toshiba-7 in 1(convection, sensor cook, bake,grill,air-fry ,microwave) that is stainless steel inside, very quiet  and even though it it smaller, I love it. Look at the 7in1 if you don’t mind sacrificing some interior space. I use the microwave daily for cooking and heating. My 9” square dish will not rotate in the 7 in 1 but a 1 round plate or pie dish fits just fine. For 2-4 people I can cook what I need in that smaller oven. It came with pans and racks for air frying, grilling. I haven’t used those features yet and it cost a bit more than I wanted to spend but it is worth it for the looks, the stainless interior, the quiet operation and all the extra features."
5,Compact size and heats well
5,"This fit our needs perfectly.  We have had it for about a month and are very satisfied.  There is just my husband and me, so the small size is just right.  A dinner plate just fits.  Tried a casserole size dish and the warming plate was overstressed.  The micro worked, food cooked ok, just not as well as a large machine.  I wouldn't recommend it for a large family.  But I believe that was made clear in the description.  Also this cannot be wall mounted or placed on a shelf.  Needs adequate room behind and around it.  Hope this helps in your decision to purchase or pass."
1,"This microwave is not great - leaves hot spots, does not warm up the food properly. I wish I would have gotten one with the sensor. Makes a huge difference. I like the handle and the look of it but that doesn’t make a difference when I scald my mouth with one bite and then next is freezing...Update on microwave: I’ve had it for less than 3 months and it has started making a loud noise when on as well as the tray on the inside jerking around in a circle while the food “warms”. So much jerking that coffee literally splashed out of my cup and onto the microwave. This is a total lemon but my time for returns has apparently expired. Just buy a microwave at the store if at all possible and save yourself the hassle of this one. All the best."
1,"Came downstairs in the morning a few days after it was set up, microwave was running for no reason (I live alone, did not use in the night, etc.). Only way to get it to stop running was to unplug it. When plugged back in, the microwave began running again and the control buttons no longer worked. Only way to get it to stop was to unplug it again. I returned it and bought a different brand instead. Would not recommend, it's a safety hazard."
5,"Bought this for my daughter’s first apartment (no roommates), in her new state, for her first big girl job!While waiting for her furniture to arrive, we used this quite frequently for meals, since we didn’t have any kitchen supplies.It looks good and not cheap.It had some weight to it as well.It cooked quite well, but keep in mind that you need to get used to the results. I put things in it and used times that I would on my older built-in and this cooked much faster or at a higher rate. So be careful if you’re going from an older unit.She likes the air-frying ability, which is why I bought this one.No need for another big appliance to be stored or leave on your precious, limited counter space!Very pleased with this microwave!"
3,"The microwave is fine, does what it's suppose to. My issue is that the light went out only a few months after I bought it. I emailed customer service at Farberware twice and never got a reply. So I'd be cautious buying anything from this brand as they seem to walk away once the product is sold. You're on your own."
3,"For small spaces , very compact. It heats very well and cooks too . The popcorn button does not do a good job of popping all the kernels. Otherwise it's a good deal for the price . It sweats when cooking and accumulates water . I have to wipe it down after each use Bummer . I would give it a five otherwise ."
1,"I used this product 2-3x.  It's 32 days old.  My son cooked something in it and now I can't get the smell out.  I've tried everything....lemon juice, baking soda, and nothing gets the smell out.  I have owned other microwave ovens for years and never had an issue.  I have contacted Amazon and they won't help as it's past 30 days and Panasonic wants me to drive it 40 minutes away to have it looked at.  Not worth the hassle.  Good to know...will never buy another Panasonic product again!"
1,"I had this microwave for six months or so and it quit, called GE they said they would send out a repair person  he said he didn't know why they would send out a repair man to look at something that repair parts are not even made. One more note I usually wouldn't write a review but I am single and a microwave comes in darn handy."
4,"Took some time to readjust to the new ""times"".  After a few tries I found that it works just as good or betterthan my old one.I now use a microwave plate Under potatoes to ""bake"" them.  It also cut the time down by a whole minute."
1,"Beware!! Don't buy this piece of junk. Followed all instructions, plugged it in, and the lights worked but nothing else. Called B & D Customer Service and she said to return it. How?? It weighs 40 pounds, we can't go out of the house to the post office because of the ""stay at home"" order. We are old; live in the country, and my husband is on oxygen. Would simply throw it away--but wait--it can't be put in trash because it is a hazardous piece. It was made in China. I always bought Black & Decker in the past but this is the very last time I will ever purchase from them."
2,"I am very pleased with this microwave ovenVery easy to operate, and it does an excellent job for my cooking needs.  Thanks Farberware for a great product"
3,The push button is hard to push to open
1,Box came damaged as is and under the microwave the metal is bent probably because it had no protection when it was delivered so it’s uneven underneath and the microwave wobbles
2,This product arrived damaged and without an instruction manual.
1,"I bought this microwave on June 27th and got it pretty fast but that's the only good thing I can say about it. It stopped working on July 29th(2 days after the return policy was void) and hasn't worked since. I normally don't post reviews on here but this purchase truly upset me and I'd like to prevent others from making the same mistake as I did. If you need a microwave, PLEASE buy anyone but this one. You'll be sorry."
1,Microwave lasted less than 2 years before we had issues.  Microwave would power on but it would not allow any key entries other than to enter the time for the clock.  Warranty is only 1 year.  Repair estimate was 150.00.  Cheaper to buy another microwave.  We would not purchase again.
5,"We looked for a microwave that would fit on our bookshelf for a few months, then found this one.  It fit perfectly and looks great, would buy it again."
5,"Had this a couple of weeks now.....  LOVE IT!  For the price, I was expecting to be disappointed with SOMETHING on it, but this is one of those rare times that I ""WAS NOT!!!"" It's a BEATIFUL deep rich ""burgundy"" color. It even has an LED light inside, AND....... It cooks just a tad faster than the ones I had in the past, so be aware of that. Test drive the timing for the 1st few uses. GREAT DEAL !!!  It also has an ""automatic"" 30 second timer to warm up your coffee or tea ~~""CHEERS!""~~"
1,"I had read the reviews and there was complaints about the noise level of the microwave oven.  The reviews did not come close to the irritation of the noise level.  IT IS LOUD!  Additionally, the control panel of my unit did not operate properly.  Setting the time should have been extremely easy.  My unit would not accept any number other than 1,2 or 3.  And I wanted a white microwave oven.  This one is all stainless steel except for a small square of white on the front.  I do have to say, Amazon was efficient and extremely helpful with the return."
4,"The door sounds ""tinny"" when closing it. Just an observation, not a complaint.Other than that, the unit works fine."
3,"Works ok for cooking, but during a period when it got very light use (one person, sick and not eating much)- the button to open it died after just a month. So it requires two hands to open now- one to push the button and one to pull open the door. I can still use it, but this seems inauspicious, and when it dies I will just pay more for a different brand."
5,"Great seller, fast shipping, reasonably priced, great for basement/Apartment kitchenette or college dorm room, highly recommend"
2,"I purchased this unit after my previous unit, for which I had used for 18 years, finally gave out. After only 14 months, this one has stopped working. Needless to say I am very disappointed."
1,So disappointed it’s a beautiful microwave! But within 3 days of having the microwave the push button to open the microwave door stopped working so now I have to open the door with my hand while holding the push button down. I read the reviews but loved the looks and price. I will definitely be returning. DO NOT BUY
5,"The media could not be loaded.I was looking for a substitute for my old tiny microwave and found this. First, the convection oven caught my eyes. It can be used as an oven to bake pizza. I tried with the pre made frozen pizza from grocery store. It turned as good as using the actual oven. Very good feature. The second option that impressed me is it even can do air fry. I haven’t got a chance to try out yet. But that really save time and money especially if you don’t owned a air fryer. This super 3 in 1 microwave is a must have home appliance. The smart sensor feature saves my time. I don’t need to worry about the heat up time anymore. Just one push, things will be ready. That is also good for elders. I have been using the oven feature for couple time. The food all met my expectations. Grill mash potatoes with cheese, just ready in 15 minutes."
5,"Absolutely perfect for my situation, small(a good thing)but powerful cooks potatoes perfect was ok for microwave popcorn,  the bag wouldn't spin with the turntable other than that it does what I need it to do"
3,Very weak low wattage device. Everything takes longer to reheat or cook.
4,"Attractive with air-fry and other good features. Less noisy than others I have owned.However, one stupid design flaw which is that the control panel display is almost illegible in other than strong light (see pic). Mine is shaded by cabinets and I have to use my phone flashlight to read it in low light! Dumb mistake - whiter lettering or backlight would solve the problem. Gave it 1* for ease of use and user interface, but I'm keeping it because of its other features, looks, and perfect fit in my space"
3,Feet on the bottom are not flush so it rocks back and forth unless you put something underneath one of the feet to level it out. They do not adjust.You shouldn't have to deal with that right outta the box so I'm annoyed. Worried a return/replacement will have the same issue so I'll just keep it.Other than that it seems alright and looks nice.
2,Worked for 3 months then stopped
3,"It takes extra time to heat anything in this microwave. Which is okay, however, after only 8 months of use the thing turned into Thor and almost caught fire. Scared my kids. It was arcing really bad with a microwave meal inside, and stated smoking. I wouldn't recommend."
4,"I love this beautiful microwave and it is perfect except for one little flaw that really bugs me .. the display window is not bright enough! I actually thought of returning the microwave because of that but it is perfect in so many ways that others are not, I decided to keep it."
4,You think all oven are same but this was difficult to figure out kept going to instruction would not buy again. Very small ok.
1,"Broke within the year, and my husband and I rarely use it. Cheap quality- do not waste your money!"
2,"Until it suddenly stopped working 9 months in, this appliance met our needs for light daily reheating. Unfortunately, when it stopped working for no obvious reason I was unable to reach a human at Panasonic to help me either locate a company to repair the still under warranty appliance or to exchange it for a new one. The repair company listed on Panasonic's website says they have not been doing warranty work for years and has been unable to get Panasonic to correct the info online. I have called all the local appliance repair places, and none do Panasonic warranty work. I can't reach anyone via chat or phone at Panasonic. So, I am faced with purchasing a new product... despite this initially seeming like a good product, it won't be Panasonic."
4,"I put this on a kill-a-watt meter, it uses way more power than 1200 watts.at full power (P10) it will pull ~1895wP6 = ~1150wP7 = ~1262wP8 = ~1380wP9 = ~1600w--- so you get more power but its a pain to lower the setting every use and the display is hard to see in certain angles"
2,From the beginning door was difficult to open. I kept thinking that it was from the sticky tape.now finally broken with just the push of the open door button.  I should have returned it.
2,"I bought this October 2021.Paint is bubbling, then chipping.I guess I should make sure there are no sparks!!!!"
4,"I chose this oven because it was promised that with the inverter technology I will no longer get cold food on a hot plate. It was a stretch. The reality is that it (maybe) distributes the heat more evenly, that's it.Nevertheless, the oven works fine for an arbitrary oven. It can be programmed to cook in stages (e.g. 1 min @ 100% then 2 min @ 50% then 5 min @ 20%)."
5,"Very nice , just to big for apartment"
3,So I’ve yet to figure out how to cancel a time and even if I did I don’t think it should be so unintuitive that it requires a user to look up the cancel command in a manual. Also despite having numbers on the key pad you can only use the preset times. Otherwise I like the size and heating capacity. It’s the same power as a Panasonic I have but it’s small so it heats faster. But the interface is a deal breaker. Going to return.
1,"We mostly used the product for cooking meals.  It can be difficult to reset the clock when the power goes out, and figuring out how to get around the preset was also aggravating.  But, the real kicker was when the machine started turning itself on and resisting efforts to turn it off.  We came back from the store, and found it running!  Pressing the Pause/Off button did nothing, nor did opening the door.  Only pulling the plug and letting it rest for a while before plugging it back in would stop it.  When we tried to contact product support at Toshiba, they say they didn't sell this model in the USA or Latin America.  A machine that operates itself CANNOT be safe!  A company that won't respond shouldn't be trusted."
4,"This seems to do everything I want. I gave it four stars instead of five, because you have to hit the buttons just right to make it work, and their sweet spot is a little bit up and to the left instead of being dead center."
5,Compact and stylish. It would look and fit  great in any kitchen or dorm room.
4,Works nice and quiet and cooks well
5,"Great microwave for the price. It warms, thaws, beeps, and spins like we hoped it would. Smaller than what we had, but not noticing any lack. Only difference due to lower wattage is somethings take longer, but that's all about math, not the product."
5,"thank you,great microwave."
4,"UPDATED REVIEWI'm liking it more. The Comfee 700  watt microwave is quieter than my old Mainstays and heats quicker too. So I'm feeling better about purchasing it. I also like that it has a pull door rather than an always failing pushbutton door. The question then is how durable is it and how long will it be in service? Time will tell. The warranty registration issue remains an irregular problem, though.ORIGINAL REVIEWIt seems that one cannot register the warranty for this Comfee microwave oven at either the Midea or Comfee websites. Midea returns a script stating ""Incorrect Product Make"" (there's no 'Comfee' option only Midea or Artic King) and Comfee just displays a blank page (see the attached photograph). I'm glad I've found this out BEFORE purchasing their expensive countertop portable dish washer and wasting another $350 (US) dollars. Don't make the same mistake as me."
1,The media could not be loaded.Worked well for about 2 months Aug 16 to Oct 23Past return window.  Now I need to waste how many unknown hours to try and get a replacement.
2,"The white plastic sliders on the turn table ring are too tall, not allowing the glass plate to sit right. It slips. Comes off. Makes noise."
2,"This is a nice looking Microwave. Operates great, cooks well. I really liked it, then, after having it 14 months or so, the LED light started flickering after being on a few minutes. This is annoying, as I normally also leave the door to the microwave cracked open a bit after microwaving something, to let the smell, humidity, whatever out of the microwave.I search online, and read the bulb is not replaceable. Also, iIread that many other people have this issue. Warranty is only 1 year, so, Toshiba will not cover this.It's a shame. This is a nice microwave, but, that LED bulb does not just flicker, it flickers fast, like a strobe light, and from what I have read, this will just get worse.Also, while searching for solutions, I read in the reviews for the 1.2 Cu. Ft. model for this Toshiba microwave, that models manufactured from October 2018 no longer use an LED bulb, and Toshiba replaced it with an incandescent bulb. Sure enough, the product listing for the 1.2 Cu. Ft model no longer lists it as having an LED bulb.I suggest, if you are thinking about keeping this microwave anymore than a year, do not buy this model. The 1.2 Cu. Ft model is not much larger, and it has a more reliable bulb.A flickering bulb may not sound like much of a big deal, but, it's only been a few days here, and it's already a bit annoying and distracting. Do not buy this model, buy the 1.2 Cu. Ft. model, and before putting it to use, make sure it is not old stock that has the LED bulb."
5,"had this item for sometime now, works consistently well, not too big, looks good, used every day for multiple culinary tasks from defrosting to warming, and scrambled eggs!, yup, microwave scrambled eggs, does them perfectly, great item, would buy again."
5,This is such a good size and still powerful to do all I was able to do with a larger model.
3,"I wanted to get a microwave and convection combo and this unit seemed to fit what I was looking for but after using it one time I am returning it. It tries to do too many things in one unit.Pros:Good pricemultifunctionEasy interior clean upCon:You are limited in the size of the try you can put in because the glass tray will always rotate and with some dishes the dish will not rotate inside the unit.No multi-level cooking so you can only cook on the one level which causes you to cook only one dish at a time. for example if you want to cook chicken tenders and french fries you have to cook them separately because if you try to cook them in one dish of with the racks that came with the unit, they won't come out well and you will have to then cook them longer.I am returning this and going back to my Oster Convection Oven (can cook on two levels at the same time) and look to get just a plain microwave for those quick meals/snacks."
2,This is a great microwave in how it works but after having it for a year now it no longer works at all has no power going to it when it goes to everything else so it seems like the power supply is fried
2,"Control panel is non-illuminated, and is fairly hard to read unless you bend down to read the faintly labelled buttons.  Button presses require way too much pressure to operate, and the pressure used often causes a double entry when selecting the cook time in 30 second increments.  Pushing pressure on the buttons causes the whole oven to shift on the counter because the unit's feet are not non-skid type. Awkwardly worded instruction manual: an example is ""In waiting state, put the food in the oven, press the menu key in the sensor cook"".  A company that had $32 billion dollars in 2020 sales, can't hire a proofreader?  No complaints about cooking performance, but I won't buy this brand again."
5,Title pretty much sums it up. We use it alot and haven't had any issues.
2,"Looks nice, perfect size and effective."
4,"Needed a microwave that fit the shelf we already had in the kitchen and I was wanting an air fryer so thought this fit the bill.It might not be the very best at airfrying, or microwaving, or convection bake, but the fact it does all of those things in a compact space makes it a winner. Using air fry for potatoes and veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, chick peas) is great."
1,The first one I bought lasted five years.  So I purchased the same one this November and now in February only three months later it is making awful noise.  I can't believe it.  Can't be returned now and I'm stuck with this.  Very surprised at RCA.  Big disappointment.
1,Just purchased this and it arrived dented!
1,"I bought this TOSHIBA 3-in-1 EC042A5C-SS in May 2023 for a 2d home. I gave away a microwave which I'd had for 30 years and which still worked (although it was huge). I visited my 2d home a few TIMES over months while remodeling. I did not use this microwave even 6 times.Then, it just QUITs. Blacked out. No response to any buttons. Plugged in, plugged out, no change. No way to contact Toshiba for support. Beyond the 30 days Amazon return date. PURE JUNK."
4,I have only ONE negative comment.  There is no backlighting for the keypad and it can be difficult to locate desired keys.
4,"The turn table mechanism is not well placed.  It is easily shifted ""offline"" and difficult to recenter."
5,"Granted I may have to cook some things longer due to low wattage; however, for my purpose this has been great.  I've had it for 15 months and pretty much use it daily.  The price was very good, and one of the reasons I like it so much is the good finish inside the microwave.  I usually have to get rid of a microwave due to the finish inside that starts to chip away after awhile.  There is absolutely none of that with this product.  I like the idea that it is small and does not take up much room on the counter.  I'm very pleased with this."
3,It’s ok for the price I guess but everything takes twice as long to cook. Wish I hadn’t purchased it
1,NOT POWERFULL ENOUGH  !!
1,"Probably defective, but isn't there quality control to keep this from happening? First it smelled horrible on the inside. We haven't needed a new microwave in 12 years so I assumed it was the new smell. Tried a couple things to heat up. One was 30 seconds, one was one minute and the last was 3 minutes. It still smelled awful even after cleaning it twice before we heated stuff up but on that third go round the smell was horrible and it just turned itself off after a minute and 42 seconds. No lights, no clock nothing. Just burnt out right away. And such a hassle just getting it back to Amazon.Zero stars."
4,As a microwave it is pretty good.  Not so good as a convection oven. It takes way too long to heat up.
4,It works
2,"Upon opening box and taking out, the corner was damaged although it still works the corner was badly dented"
2,"It is a nice looking microwave, but it is so loud when you use it. I’m not sure if it’s working right to be that loud or not I don’t know who to ask."
2,Just OK not worth the $
4,"My 11 year old built in microwave just died and I bought this microwave to 'get by' for now. The microwave arrived free of damage, thankfully. It's definitely a micro microwave. The first thing I heated was a cup of coffee, and it heated it up very quickly. It has several buttons for such a small microwave, which is nice...but also kind of strange, b/c it's so small, it won't hold large dishes. I like button #8, which turns off the 'beep' when it's finished it's job. The microwave works well and it will get me by, until I have time to arrange and schedule the installation of another built in. I'd say for the price, it's good for just one person...esp if you need a very small micro microwave.*Update: 5/8/21: I've used this little microwave multiple times every single day since it arrived @ my doorstep and it's been great. Once you get used to the small size, you're good to go. It's a great little 'workhorse'. (Since you have to be careful not to over fill your popcorn bowl w/ kernels....it's actually helped me cut down on the consumption of that also.)*Update: 11/6/21: This little workhorse is still going strong. I use it every day and it still works perfectly.* One more update: 11/24/23 - This is a great little microwave that is used daily...multiple times a day. I use it way more often than the large built in. This microwave is convenient to use being on the counter & does a great job. Love it for popcorn too."
4,"Heats up well. Will need to use an 8"" microwave plate cover (larger size throws off the glass plate). Annoyed with the clock because despite following instructions, it will not program correctly."
1,Two months and door no longer opens.
5,"This is a high quality microwave that is perfect for my microwavestand.. It's quiet, strong sturdy and easy to use. It is very easy to clean. It heats nicely and has so many different setting. Love it worth the money"
4,"They really need to make the setup with alexa/your Echo more straight forward. That aspect of this device is a total disaster. I have worked with computers and tech including live sound and commercial studio equipment and rarely have issues setting up things. I never thought I'd be beat into submission by a microwave and app! I ended up giving up on the Alexa functionality of this microwave as it simply didn't work after wasting hours on it. Fix that and you'll have a winner!as a microwave, it's been great so far! It heats evenly and has plenty of power etc. No issues with that side of things. Size wise it's fine;not too big and not too small.Unlike my microwave that lasted 20 years, microwaves these days seem to have a limited life span so we'll see how long this one lasts.It's certainly worth considering if you're in the market for a new microwave, but, you may not end up with Alexa voice control."
1,"Everything was working great until it wasn't. It was used in a two-person household, so it wasn't used outrageously in the 8 months we had it, and it would regularly be cleaned. I've never had a microwave just start sparking and making a grinding noise like this one had, so it was a disappointment to see it happen after only 8 months of use. Off to buy another microwave, definitely not this one again!"
5,"Having my microwave for 15 years before it decided to just quit I was surprised how far the technology has advanced. This unit perfectly heats water for tea in less than half the time, cooking and reheating is perfect as well. You can't go wrong choosing this microwave."
4,Easy to use
1,"This is the only size that fits and I thought Black and Decker was a good brand but this microwave was weak to being with but after a few weeks, I opened it and it would not shut off. It runs when you open the door, very dangerous and they wanted me to call customer support at B&D to trouble shoot this POS, not worth it. Amazon should have taken a return."
5,"It was a gift from me to a family member, it was deliver on time, package no damage, it worked when we tried it. RCA's is a good brand I trust. It's been about 2 months and still working good as the first day they used it."
3,"It's a microwave and it works. It took awhile to get used to the new controls vs my old much simpler one, but it seems overly complicated. I guess because it can do a lot of things? It beeps a lot, I wish there was a setting somewhere that I could make it beep less or not at all when you push the buttons. I always feel bad when I am using the microwave if someone in the house is sleeping. It's also pretty loud while in use. The door seems to get stuck on something when I open it, so it only opens halfway easily. You can open it more if you needed, but not sure if this is intended or some defect. Also it is pretty ugly and shows all fingerprints. It works for me, but I would never pick this one to buy again."
1,"This microwave has nothing but constant issues.- Time: I have the microwave connected to my WiFi and it refuses to observe daylight savings time, IF I CHANGE THE TIME IT RESETS the time to use non-DST.- It fails to communicate with any of my Echo devices frequently and my Echo Studio is 6 feet away in direct line of sight. I most commonly hear ""Something went wrong .... ""a. I have an Echo Wall clock that is managed by my echo devices and it has no issues with DST.Do yourself a favor and buy another microwave, or plan on having a host of recurring issues."
2,"As several other reviewers have indicated, this microwave draws much more 120v current than specified; the spec says 12.4 amps (1480 watts), I measured 17.2 amps (2050 watts).  It trips a15 amp circuit breaker within a minute or so of operation.  it should be fine on a 20 amp cirucuits required for newer houses, as long as nothing else is plugged in."
4,"Only gave 4 stars as I really wanted a unit without the browning / baking option, but didn't see what I wanted.  Purchased this as a replacement for a microwave that I purchased three months ago.  This one is much, much better.  Turntable continuing to work fine & it heats fine.  I do like the way one can set the power quickly after setting the power.  Easy to clean except for the browning element in the top.  The element also limits somewhat the height of items that one is heating, like Uncle Ben's instant rice mixes.  Overall satisfied with the purchase."
1,Had it for literally a few days and now the light is no longer working.
5,"A microwave is a microwave, right?  When I bought this, it was the cheapest microwave that Amazon was offering.I moved into a really inexpensive apartment, and it didn't have a fridge or range.  I found a used fridge that included delivery, but there wasn't any hookup for a range, so I figured this would get me by until I could do something more versatile.Bad news: some foods, they say not to cook them in a microwave with less than 1100 watts.Good news: don't get your undies in a bundle, because you can do a little experimenting and it'll be just fine.This unit has a carousel, which is very nice.  In the early days of microwaves, I had a really expensive unit without, and it was a pain.  It isn't perfect; if you put a 20-ounve foam cup of water near the edge, the carousel doesn't work really well.  A problem?  Now that I know better, there haven't been any strange noises.I've gotten spoiled by microwaves that have a ""minute plus"" or ""add 30 seconds"" button.  It's convenient, and I don't think this oven has that feature.  The manual that came with it is impossible for me to read, due to my failing eyes.  If they had a pdf online, I could increase the font size, but I haven't found it ter.This isn't is intended for putting in your office or bedroom, rather than being your primary microwave in the kitchen, but I'm using as a substitute for a range.  That's a pretty severe test.  I gives me the confidence to say that - especially if you can read small type - this will serve quite well in your office, rec room, or bedroom.Microwaves are no longer $700, and if you need a big microwave, you probably should spend a few extra bucks for one, but for a small, inexpensive unit, this is a great product!"
5,Perfecto calienta bien la comidas .es  de buen tamaño  me encantó la oferta que obtuve
1,"I wanted to love it, but absolutely dislike it. The no back light on keypad required I order a magnetic sewing machine light to use the darn thing. It shows every, single spot and print on the outside. Would have returned it but husband threw out the box and it is too heavy for me to try to return it. I suggest you do not buy this, even in a lit area cannot read the pad."
4,I was pleasantly surprised how easy to use it was.. Heats evenly and looks great in the kitchen. Has several functions that can be used. It's quite!
3,"The control panel is infuriating - the numbers are so faint (bad color contrast) and there is no backlighting, so we have to use a flashlight to read the numbers, even though our kitchen is well lit. It is beyond imagination why this important feature was omitted. Other than that, the oven works well."
4,Love that I have three products in one. I probably would have never bought an air fryer and had been wanting one. Love it. I did have to get a grounded outlet put in which I did not mind. The house is over 60 yrs old. The only problem I have is the control panel is not illuminated. The selections are gray and are hard to see.
1,Product died after just 12 months with a H98 error code.
3,"Having owned and used a microwave for over 40 years (all the way back to the Amana radarrange), I could never imagine I'd need an instruction manual to figure out how to heat something in a microwave.I don't know who designed the controls on this, but I don't think they ever used a microwave oven before.If you want to set a cook time and power, you know how that's done?  You press the button to change the clock time, but press it twice.  Then you can enter the cook time, then hit the power level button a choose a power level.The noise level of the unit when cooking is fine, but the chime when it is done is ear splitting.  You can here it throughout the house!Not a bad unit, but save the instruction manual, you're going to need it. And yes, we have amazon echo units but why bother integrating them?  You still have to put things in the oven to heat them, so why add a voice command when your finger is an inch away from the buttons?"
5,"First off, it's large enough for 9x13 baking pans to rotate if warming large dishes.  It's quieter than our old microwave, I know that will be relevant to what your using now, and there are no rattles or vibrations that cause noise.  I love the power level setting.  Our old unit just turned on and off to pulse cook, so power level 5 cooked for 50% of the time.  This unit actually turns down the power and cooks at a lower setting continuously, much nicer.  We have been using this for about 4 months now and have had no issues.  The buttons push with a softer touch than our old unit, so the keypad should last longer.  Only negatives: I wish it had a beverage button to heat a mug of water, now we need to key in 1:10 instead of just a one button push.  Our old unit auto started once you put in your selection, this one you have to push start.  I wish the key pad lit up, so you could find the keys in low light condition."
3,"It's possible I was spoiled by my Whirlpool over the range convection microwave, as this model just doesn't measure up. The regular microwave function works just fine- but the air-fry and convection features do not. I'm not sure if the thermostat is malfunctioning, but it simply doesn't get hot enough. It takes much longer to make ANYTHING in this microwave than it does using a conventional oven or air fryer."
3,"It does everything a microwave should do. No complaints about the product itself. I would recommend it. But it is not stainless steel. It's a black microwave with stainless trim, top and bottom of window and stainless around the control panel."
4,microwave slides on cart or counter when you try to close door. 1 hand to hold 1 hand to close door
4,"You get what you pay for: That is to be constantly remembered.I normally rent in apartment units that do provide one. Not this time.I have now gotten used to Microwave ovens so I needed one for sure but not too big that it could fit on my kitchen counter without stealing the whole space.I decided to go for a reasonably priced Microwave oven, considering that I may only need it for a year or two.The RCA appeared as one of the best appreciated on Amazon website.It works fine but I have gotten used to quick touches... In this case, you have to type the whole duration. If you select 1, it will run for 1 second. So you have to enter 100 to get a minute. Not a big deal.Apart from that, it does a good work reheating my food."
4,"I like this new microwave alot, the only thing that surprised me is it is louder than i thought it would be"
3,very low wattage. I keep eating cold food.
5,"Unlike some of the photographs, the interior is bright white instead of gray.  All features I have used are perfect for my needs.  Heating a cup of water for tea is not long enough so I time it for 1 minute 33 seconds."
5,Easy set up everything works great
5,"Perfect compact size for what I needed - no built-in so needed countertop without occupying space.I don’t need microwave to “cook” anything or heat large dinner plates, just the everyday warming, reheating leftovers etc that is too much effort to use stovetop utensils for. So the size and power is good enough.Only downside is I expected stainless steel color and finish and it’s actually black on the sides - stainless steel only in the front. So I felt some of the images were misleading/photoshopped"
1,El microondas solo lo use 2 veces y se arruino ya no funciona ha donde tengo que ir para que me lo cambien
5,I don't usually write a review on a microwave but i love this one! Its compact enough to b on my countertop n i love the design. We only use a microwave to heat up food .. so i wanted something more compact n less expensive. This one is perfect! It heats up food pretty fast n just perfect for what we wanted it for .. the best thing is the price is perfect! I also purchased the 4 year extended warranty just n case :)
1,"The initial device I'd received had a misaligned door which did not close properly. So we did an easy exchange. The replacement looked better and appeared to function as advertised. But the second time I used the ""air fryer"" function, the device began to make an horrendous noise, a machine-gun like rat-a-tat. The same thing happens with the ""convection"" function. This noise, which may, or may not, suggest dangerousness, makes these functions unusable. The quality control here is, obviously, non-existent and I would advise prospective customers to avoid this item."
3,"I must use a flashlight shined on the display to see what buttons to use. The only light up on it is the time and it is good and bright.  Still learning to use it, yet you cannot adjust the time when setting something to cook, cooking a chicken breast at 360 for 10 min and it is automated and does not match the times I used in my other Air fryer.  I think the convection will be ok but again you cannot set time and tempura separate.  Microwave is good.  Maybe it is just the way the book is written that makes it all hard to understand"
4,I have not used all of the features yet.  It does heat quickly.  I put a frozen dinner in for the instructed time. it was over cooked and hot as lave.
3,"Grill tray warped on first use in convection use.  Not level bottom any more.  No instructions in manual for air-fry, but I figured it out reading other manuals from other devices.  Very annoying.  Sensor temperature and cooking time settings were too long."
4,It is an important addition to my cooking needs.  I like gett8ng crispness without the excess oil.
3,"This is a pretty inexpensive microwave/oven unit. If you don’t have a pre conceived expectation like we did of how it should function and what the build quality should be, then I think this could suffice.PRO:InexpensiveGood microwave powerQuietLooks okayCON:Small on the insideWobbles on a flat surfaceCheap metallic feelWe had a Sharp convention microwave oven that we finally needed to replace after 15 years and thought we’d save a few hundred by going this route. Nope, we shipped this one right back and ponied up the dough for the quality of the Sharp.Basically, you get what you pay for."
1,"I bought this unit after returning a faulty Toshiba. It's an ok, run-of-the-mill microwave oven, nothing fancy. Last night I heated up some food and after only 20 seconds, it was crackling with excess heat. Weird, I thought, but let it go as an anomaly. Tonight my wife used it to heat up a potato. After only two minutes, the potato burst into flames!So I threw this piece of junk in the trash before it kills us.  What a disappointment."
5,I like it. has many new feature to go on daily job. grandson has also did it
4,"For what is described at a Professional model, it is ,much lighter and slides around on the shelf. Otherwise it works fine and looks good."
5,I gave this microwave as a present to someone who has a very small kitchen . I think it’s a good product for the money is  not  bulky.
5,I like this micro wave very much  Powerful
5,Cute small microwave. Exactly what I was looking for. Matches all my other ge appliances.
3,"I thought this was a good microwave when I first got it as a wedding gift. I was later disappointed to find out that the microwave doesn't heat food up as quickly as other microwaves I used in the past. I also couldn't fit in my dinner plates without tilting them in at an angle to put them in and take them out. In general there's a size limitation but you can fit in mugs, bowls, and medium sized plates. I'm used to being able to put in my dishes and desserts so this is the first time I had to worry about size. Other than the negatives of the size and additional warming time I think this product is a decent microwave with settings such as popcorn, defrost, easy cook. The other positive is it does fit in my small apartment kitchen and the product's style looks good."
2,"The whole idea of getting a combination oven was to save space and get multiple functionalities in one item as advertised.After several months of trying, we ended up using it only as a microwave oven, since the conventional oven functionality is pretty much useless. It takes 15 min to reach 425, dries food quickly, and can't toast anything. Unless you don't have a range oven in your kitchen, it does not add anything.  I felt like I got a bulky fancy microwave oven for the price of three.  I had to bring my old toaster oven right next to it to make it a real combo."
5,I would definitely purchase again.
4,I really like the color inside. Easy for the kids to use.
5,Perfect size to fit on my counter under the kitchen cabinets. Fits a large plate. Hits quickly & easily. Looks nice. Fast delivery. Great price.
3,"I chose this model for 3 and only 3 reasons. 1 it was the right size. 2 it had a handle instead of a push-button. (Our old microwave had a push-button handle that became miserable to operate.) 3 this one has a button you can push to silence the beeper. HOWEVER, the stupid silencing feature only works half of the time...the other half of the time, the beeper still beeps. And when I say it beeps, I mean if you don't open the door quickly enough, it will start beeping again and continue to beep until you want to toss the microwave out the window. On the other hand, the convection oven is a nice bonus feature. It works great for heating up a few muffins or whatever. The microwave voltage must be a little lower than our old microwave because things take longer to heat. Overall, it's too bad that the beeping is so irritating that if overshadows the product's performance. But it is. By the way, the specifications say you can push a button to silence it. In reality, you have to hold down the 8 button for 3 seconds to silence the beeper. Supposedly!"
5,Our first Panasonic was a similar model to this new microwave. It lasted about 10 years and was one of the best we’ve owned. This model is in the same line for ease of use and features. We’ve found both to be at the high end of the power spectrum which make heating and cooking fast and efficient. It fits our kitchen décor nicely and has an ergonomic key pad that is simple to understand.
1,The product looks nice but it had an oily smell inside but after I used a coffee mug with baking soda & another one a day later with used coffee grounds it was fine. I was happy with it until a few days ago when the motor seemed to have a grinding noise. I thought it was the track under the plate that had some food debris so I removed it. I turned it on a again and heard a loud popping sound. It stopped and I could smell something electrical burned out. Ugh! I’ll contact support but I don’t know if they’ll offer to replace it or not.
5,"When you have a new product it's challenging to grade but so far this microwave is everything I need it to be. It's easy to use and everything works properly. It's fits perfect on my smaller counter space, yet it's large enough for all of my microwavable products."
3,"Ok, so I know I went the cheap route and bought this used, but I've bought plenty of used items before and never had anything show up dirty before. Seems to work fine, but at least wipe it down, please. Hopefully more attention was paid to functionality."
5,"It might be smaller, but it's not small. It is perfect and we love it! If you own one of those space savers like we do, if it's under there perfectly with room to spare!"
3,Its like wanting a Cadillac and settling for a Mazda.  Clunky is best way to describe overall construction.  I get keeping costs reasonable but I wish someone would make premium versions of these products that have a bit more gusto.  Works as designed but would it kill anyone to light the key pad?
4,This is a very dangerous microwaveI had the comfy microwave for 3 years & last night almost caught on fire. If I wasn’t in the kitchen a big fire would have started but I caught it in time. It formed a bubble which is where fire flames were coming out.I was making popcorn and no I didn’t burn popcorn - the popcorn wasn’t fully poppedI’m adding - I always thought - It was not that easy to use - kind of confusingDon’t buy - buyer BEWARE
5,Our microwave was very old and it was time to put it out to paster.  So I ordered this mainly for the crisper feature.  I had not seen this on another microwave and I thought neat if it works.The crisper feature works well I have noticed some of my microwaveable breads are definitely not as soggy.  Microwaves have improved greatly this one is very quiet and the stainless steele looks stylish on the countertop.  Clean up is a breeze.  Great microwave.
4,lo he encontrado mas que bueno y lo mejor es que con el tamaño me resolvio algo de espacio gracias.
2,"This was to replace the same model that died after four years. The “start” button and “5” buttons are not functioning on the brand new microwave. I Will never purchase another Faberware product. Disappointed, and done with ordering appliances through Amazon."
2,"Loud start, turntable doesn’t work properly. Takes three minutes to heat a cup of coffee. I had to work to get the turntable to turn. The little mechanism under the plate was stuck. This microwave has a very loud start to it and then settles down a bit, but it really does not cook like an 1100 W microwave should. It takes twice as long as the Panasonic I had for 25 years. Wish I had sent it back after the first few days"
5,"I had no idea toasting microwaves existed! I knew it would not make actual toast, but I was skeptical on how oven like my food would be. I was pleasantly surprised. I always used the toaster over to reheat food like pizza and hot wings, but no more! My favorite setting is Grill/Combo 2 (this is a short section in the directions worth reading). For every 5 minutes in the toaster oven is about 1 minute on grill/combo 2. Also worth noting, no paper plates when using this setting. I did not catch the plate on fire, but it did smell pretty bad. Overall, I hope this microwave never dies."
2,"The microwave seems to be solid, but the smart feature are a mess.Adding it to home network is a convoluted and complex process that requires an app, account and a whole bunch of steps to complete in perfect order. The app is called MSmartLife. Dont confuse it with another app that serves the same purpose called SmartLife - it wont work.Alexa control, in my situation, does not work at all from the moment I added GE voice control wall oven. I ask alexa to 'microwave one cup of water' and she responds with confusion that I have multiple devices connected. Well, I only have one bloody microwave!The most frustrating thing and I cannot figure it out: I am on Pacific time and the microwave constantly reverts to Eastern.  Alexa's time zone is set correctly, so is the router. No idea where that stupid time zone signal comes from."
4,"I finally got the opportunity to try the microwave as I didn't have a space for it when I first got it. I haven't got to try any of the crisping features or anything like that, but it Heats really well and better than my old microwave which worked great also.I have to see how well it goes as time goes on, but I'm not real sure about the price point. I typically buy a cheaper microwave but, if this one does things that mine doesn't, it may be worth a little bit of an increase."
3,"TURNTABLE BALANCES POORLY ON THREE CONTACT POINTS--TIPS EASILY AND TURNS OFF BALANCE OUR OLDER MODEL HAD FOUR CONTACTS.  DOOR HAS DISTORTED COVER.  NO DISPLAY NOTICE WHEN COOKING FINISHED !"" CANCEL '"" BEEP TOO LOUD.  ALL IN ALL A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  AFTER 2 PREVIOUS PANASONICS."
4,"there are several pros in features, size and looks that others have mentioned.the cons are in reheating and defrosting. reheating veggies can be hit or miss compared to past microwaves. defrosting bread can be super, super quick. defrosting meats - using either timed or weight defrost - is a complete joke. if i was able to consistently make dinner decisions hours or days in advance to defrost needed food in the fridge, why would i need a microwave with defrost features?? instead, i have to add weight to set the defrost when defrosting meats. have a 10 oz steak? better weight defrost at 12 or 13 oz; and then it's only halfway defrosted. past ovens actually paused midway through the defrost time so you can turn the dish over; not this one, it keeps going to the end, only to really not defrost effectively or evenly. there's a guessing game required to use the defrost feature, which is a fail."
2,Worked great when I initially got it. Now there is something wrong with it electronically. It just stops on its own. I have to unplug it then plug it back up and it works again. Just too much trouble to ship it back
5,"Excelente performance, size, price."
4,"the microwave works fine, but the letters are hard to read for elderly persons. the power level needs to be used, so that you can save on energy.It cooks fast so one  has to be aware of what you are cooking."
4,"UPDATE:7 months in and I went to use the oven and it displayed a H98 error code.  This means the main unit that generates the microwaves has malfunctioned.  Not impressed.  We'll see if the MFG responds and I plan to reach out to them as well.Original Review:This is a good looking and big microwave.  It's 2.2cu ft and the old one was 2.0 but it seems to have the same footprint as the old 2003 Sharp model it replaced.  It's very clean looking and the buttons are all laid out well.  I noticed right away that it was considerably lighter than the older one and feels, dare I say, a little flimsy.  We'll see how it holds up to our daily usage.  The ONLY thing that made me hesitate to buy this was that I read many reviews where people had to work with customer service and had bad experiences.  Otherwise, this gets good reviews everywhere I go.  The only bad reviews are from defective models and getting it replaced, and having to hound the company to stand by their product.  Hopefully I won't have to go down that road.  I'll revisit in 6 months and update my review."
2,"Very cute counter top microwave and worked well for 2 months (it is lower power than a standard microwave, but I wasn't buying for heavy duty defrosting--so it was fine).  The microwave started shorting out after 2 months of use (I probably used it 2-3x a week to melt butter, re-heat coffee or warm leftovers)."
5,"Me gusto que eat amplio por adentro y no hace ruido, ademas es muy efectivo y se ve elegante, se los recomiendo 👌🏼"
2,I have had this microwave for 7 months. No problems until all of the sudden it stops heating and makes scary noises while in use. I have tried many settings and none work at this point. I wouldn’t recommend this microwave to anyone!
3,"I just received this microwave for my 93 year old mother's apt to replace a similar model purchased in 2016. The former model did not require additional selections using the 30 second button. With this model, when you push the 30 second button, the display then says ""Food."" Instant deal breaker. Also, I echo a similar comment from another person about the buttons being hard to see. I make small labels to put over a few buttons so my mother can see them more easily but regardless, this one is going back."
1,"but after just 10 months, its spitting and popping and making smoke at us!  and there's NO contact in their service 'contact' website! Just FAQ's. lot of good that s doing usand the link on the Amazon order page goes to a part of farberware 'service' that isn't even aware they sell microwaves!"
5,Very quiet.
5,I bought this microwave for my daughter and she loves it.I got the small size because she doesn’t have much space. The instructions were easy to follow and she learned fast how to use it. It’s easy to clean and doesn’t require a lot of maintenance. Great microwave!
1,Only reason I bought this again was because of its compact size for our small kitchen and fast amazon delivery. This microwave doesnt last long. I would be surprised if the last more than couple of years. I had the same one before and it broke after 2 years.
1,I bought this in January and it suddenly stopped working. It won't turn on and there is no visible damage. I bought it to save space but it was so expensive that I wish I had just bought a microwave and an air fryer separately.
3,"This is my third one-- same model.  It's easy to use, etc.  The first lasted about three year, then stopped working.  It's so inexpensive, well, couldn't complain.  I bought it for the form factor (dimensions)  not any other reason.  Ordered a replacement.  IT DIDN'T WORK out of the box.  Great support from Amazon.  They replaced it within 2 days.  Didn't even need the warranty I purchased.  However, the B&D batting record is not very good.  I am expecting to have to juse that warranty after-all.  Still, it works and fits in the space I have."
1,"We purchased this item about 7 months or less ago and we hardly used it, maybe a small handful of times, my wife and I started making her a birthday dinner so we wanted to melt some butter in the unit (In a plastic bowl) as soon as we tapped the start button, The unit started sparking and shooting white flames out from the holes inside the unit, After reading some of the reviews that they pitched the box and now their screwed and cannot return it!! Well this is MY hard earned money and will demand full satisfaction backed by Amazon!! Hopefully Amazon will back me up with this review!!!! This is now a safety and liability issue!!!"
5,"Like many previous reviewers, I've placed this unit inside an upper cabinet in my kitchen. I have IKEA, which are 15"" deep and gives me plenty of room to close the cabinet doors. I will at some point either drill a hole for the plug to go straight down to an outlet, or move the unit onto the countertop. Why remove it from the cabinet? the jury is still out on if the microwave unit is creating a moisture problem or not.  It is used daily and so far all is well."
1,"No user manual comes with this microwave in. It is a microwave convection, oven, broiler, and air fryer so there’s many options of different functions and things to do with it. On the on the little paper that came with it, it said to call a certain number and that they would mail you a paper copy of the manual, I called the number and they told me they don’t mail out paper copies of the manual that you have to go and look online. If my computer is in my computer room and my microwave is in my kitchen how are we supposed to remember all the instructions for the different functions  and operate it not just myself, but if an elderly person had this item and didn’t have an iPhone, they would be able to use it completely. I would not purchase this item again just for that reason."
3,Picked this all in one cooking machine to hopefully downsize to one.  Microwave part works well besides alot of condensation when cooking kids mac and cheese bowls.  The broiler works ok as well as the convection oven part.  Our old toaster oven workes better but still decided not to keep it and accept it would take a little longer to cook with this unit.  The air fryer part is a huge disappointment.  Our old air fryer works so much better that we kept it and don't use that function on the microwave combo.  Great concept but unfortunately does not compare to stand alone counterparts.
5,Love everything about this ❤ 💕 😍 ♥ 💓 microwave. Easy to use Easy to clean Easy to read and love the inside how it's  made. Perfect  size for small apartments. Most of all not heavy to LIFT.....AND did I mention it cooks Perfect. Best ever bake  POTATOES 🥔 😋 🙌 👌 😍 ❤ Thank you 😊 😋 me  very happy 😊 😋 😀 😄 ☺ 😘
3,Purchased this microwave OCTOBER 6th and received  2 days later via prime. Microwave is lightweight and has your typical microwave functions. This microwave works great but because of the lower wattage food takes longer to heat up. Microwave does not heat the food very evenly so I warm food up for 1 1/2 minutes then turn my food and repeat the timing for hot food. The microwave gets the job done and I’m not made at it especially because of the affordable price point.
2,Item arrived damaged on each side of unit.
3,"We bought this unit to replace a 20 year old microwave unit. This one is only a bit larger, but 20% more powerful. The one problem with the unit is that the turntable rests on a roller ring, and is too easily knocked ajar so that it must be re-seated. It's cumbersome and shouldn't have this silly problem. Otherwise it's fine. I would have sent it back, and I don't recommend it for this one reason, but if I ordered another brand who knows what problems it might have? I can live with it, It's just an annoyance."
3,The microwave works fine but the back is uneven so every time you go to press the buttons to warm up something it moves. It's a slight annoyance.
5,Easy to put up. Well worth the money. Works great
2,Ok quality. The heating mechanism in this isn't so good.  I had to heat meals for 2 - 3 minutes. In other microwaves that are the same size I just needed about 1:30 mins.
1,"This microwave had issues where it would stop working early on after purchasing it. Then, almost 2 years from the date of purchase it stopped working with error code H98."
5,Easy to use. Love the light inside. Size is not too big or too small. Very happy with it
5,"This is a smaller microwave than many, but just needed it as a reliable spare in the basement we use for guests, to allow them convenience. Powerful, despite it's small size."
4,Little noisy
3,"I will start by acknowledging that I did not buy this off of Amazon. I found the exact same model at a lesser price at a well-known retail store.Overall, the microwave itself seems nice, however…This model (FMO22ABTBKA) of microwave, at least the ones produced during the November of 2018 production run, have defects from the factory. According to the Farberware customer service rep that I spoke with, she has had numerous complaints about this model, produced during that time. She was unaware of issues before this production run. She also said the manufacturers know about at least one of the issues.There are two buttons that are reversed. If you want to set the clock, you have to use the timer button and vice versa. I don’t know if it is the components on the control board inside that are reversed or the overlay that you see. The other problem, which I have seen reported by other reviewers, is that when you shut the door, the microwave “resets” itself. In other words, you have to go in and reprogram the clock as if it were new or you had a power outage. This would happen to me about every second or third time that I closed the door.The only other less than positive thing that I have to say about the one that I had, is the fact that it is a relatively light appliance. This would normally not be a bad thing, however, it took a bit of pressure to activate the push button door opener. Enough so, that the microwave would slide back out of position every time I opened the door. Perhaps I had an abnormally difficult button and others would be find.On the bright side – pun intended here – it has very good interior lighting. It makes it very easy to see how the cooking of your food is progressing. This microwave also has a very large interior which would accommodate larger casseroles or oversized plates. The blue color used for the clock display is also nice in appearance.If it were not for the two above mentioned defects, which some may find to be just an inconvenience, and the overly resistant door opener button, I would have liked this microwave and would have kept it. However, if I buy something, especially at this price point, I want all of the features to work as intended. If you are considering purchasing this product, check to see if and when they remedied these issues before buying. For Customer Service and Warranty information: (800) 231-9786 or (800) 233-9054. Also, make sure the one you actually take home was manufactured outside of the problem time frame. You may have to open the box and look at the label on the back of the microwave.I realize that if you are ordering online from Amazon, you cannot open the box before ordering. However, I believe that Amazon may still be able to help with this. When considering purchasing a medication for my pet, I read several reviews that the wrong product was put in the box. (The company that made the medication put it into the wrong box. In other words, the box you received looked like what you ordered, however, what was inside was the wrong medication.) I called Amazon and explained this to them. I said to them that I would like them to open the box to make sure what was inside was the correct product. The Amazon rep – in their usual wonderful fashion, had me place the order while she was on the phone and then she put a note in the file explaining my request and that I gave my consent to open the box."
5,2 months later it went out ! I purchased august 17th and here on October 30 it went out. Not worth the money.
1,"Also no way to turn off, of course...what year is this again??"
4,"For a summer/weekend home it's a great cheap functional unit. If I had to use it every day I'd throw it out. No features, just bare bones and low power...and noisy too.....but it gets the job done, ultimately."
1,"It was great out of the box. It made cold things hot. As a man of simple needs I was satisfied.  Reading the buttons at night was not easy but I figured muscle memory would kick in eventually.6 months in and my roommate went to reheat his cup of coffee and without him pushing anything it started running and spinning with no countdown or heating.  I ran through the manual, went online to see if anyone else had reported an issue similar to no avail.So I checked on Amazon and it was past its return date for them. Contacted Faberware's contracted service provider and its weeks just dealing with emails through them so we bought something else since it was urgently needed to heat the high end gas station cuisine my roommates subsist on. Now the question is whether to keep beating the warranty horse and having a backup eventually maybe or sticking it out back for the scrappers to haul off.  Time and free space will tell."
2,"The title states it all.  Lasted about 18 months, outside the one year warranty, and goes to crap.  Farberware Professional is a bit of a joke.  Not the company they used to be."
1,You cannot use this microwave for more than 2 minutes without it shutting off. We did all the troubleshooting and nothing works. I have thrown it away after just 6 weeks.
3,"I really like the inverter defrost and the fact that you can actually dial back the power level rather than just the duty cycle on this type of microwave. The finish is nice and it runs fairly quietly. The sensor cooking actually works fairly well and the sensor reheat is decent for one-touch leftovers.That said, I have had two issues with this microwave in the short time I have owned it. First, the number pad/buttons are a kind of plastic/rubber printed film that will scratch/ripple/deform if you brush it with a fingernail. The number 2 and the start button have basically begun scratching off after only a few months of use. Second, somewhat careless removal of a coffee mug from the carousel took a large chip out of the edge of the glass. I have owned several microwaves and never have I seen such fragile glass used for the carousel. Thankfully it broke cleanly and didn't crack the rest of it and still works fine."
5,It has been 9 months since I received my microwave. I am writing because in just the last 2 days when we use it it smells like something is burning inside. Is there a way of getting a new one sent out and we can send this one back?Thank you
4,SMALL MICROWAVE AT REASONABLE PRICE
3,Noisy on start up after that it’s not bad
3,Why is everything made so cheaply anymore!?  This thing vibrates and makes a funny sound when running compared to my old microwave.  Gave it three stars because after it is all said and done it does get my food warm.
4,The first one we ordered took much longer than promised.We plugged it in and it sounded like it was ready to explodeWe called immediately.They said trash product. They overnighted a replacement.This company cares about its customers.Would definitely use them again
1,Item arrived defective
2,I think it's pretty bad that there's not a back light behind the buttons. It would be nice to be able to see the buttons.I haven't used the microwave for anything other than heating up so I can't review anything else.
5,The media could not be loaded.
1,"Have been trying to work this Simple Microwave, Punching digents for Weeks Now, DOES NOT WORK, RETURNING IT!!!"
3,"While this microwave suited my new apartment's needs, it has an annoying ability to cause almost anything I heat up (not overheating) to splash up or burst. I think that the microwave is not as unform as it could be. Some areas are super hot, others cold. Would not buy another one."
5,"Perfect for my use as a food warmer and occasional cooker of veggies.  The interior is 11 1/2W  7H  and 11 1/2D.  However,  the actual depth of the flat floor is 10D, front to back.  I included the 1/2"" indent in the door and about 1"" plus  slope in bottom rear.  Essentially, my 10 1/2 diameter, 1""H  large Fiesta plate  fits perfectly.  I was lucky.  Warning:  A flatter plate may not be high enough to  clear the  bottom slope  and door indent enough to give you the full 11 1/2D.  The revolving table is about 1/2"" plus from floor but sits in an indented area.  The whole thing is a bit tricky to figure out if a large dinner plate over 10""  is involved..  The turntable itself is 10""  so obviously that will work.  The exterior dimensions are  17W  10H  and  11 1/2D.  Again,  there is a 1 1/2  bump out in the rear  which makes the depth 13D.I have it on a 13 1/2 deep shelf and it sits fine.  The front feet are set back about 3"".  I am giving this detail because this is what I needed  when I was looking.  I hope this saves someone the time it takes.  Just imagine what I would do if I got a refrigerator.The digital control  is 1= one minute, 2 = two minutes, etc.  there is also a cumulative 30 second button.  Under 30 seconds I guess you just stand and wait.  The high power is relative low and is  also adjustable downward when used with the timer.  Most important for me was the 'sound "" on/off "" button.  No more beep, beep, beep  for half and hour or when I open the door.  I would have bought it for that alone and made it fit the cabinet. Aesthetically,  it is  clean and solid looking black glass and  stainless steel front.  The door closes solidly, and noisily unfortunately."
1,"We spent a considerable amount of time shopping online, to ensure we would get the microwave we wanted, specifically one that had a melt/soften function button.  This arrived; it was the same model number, but an entirely different control panel, without the melt/soften function button that was shown on the Amazon photo. The printed directions on the microwave door didn't even match the control panel.  Extremely frustrated!"
3,"Control panel is pretty useless, small font, hard to see unless you shine a bright light on it, and even when you’re able to see it, it’s confusing to use…!"
5,"I especially like the way it looks. It’s a very attractive little microwave perfect for an apartment or a student’s dorm room. Out of all of the microwaves I was considering, I feel like I made the perfect choice."
5,"My Sharp Carousel MIcrowave Oven just died, so went shopping online for another microwave oven.  So many choices, but I needed one that fits my cabinet and with 1200W.  So I narrowed it down to a few and found this one on Amazon.  It was at a very good price, size and power, but this  Toshiba model had mixed reviews.  So, I am writing my reviews to address the points from other  owners of this microwave oven.First, some owners had a difficult time setting the clock.  I read the instructions, and it was pretty intuitive and I was able to set the clock time with ease.  As for the control panel not well lit, I can see when my kitchen lights were dimmed or shut, it was a bit difficult to see (not back lit) but with normal lights on, control panel was easy to see.  You can see the picture that you can clearly see the control panel.The noise level is quieter than my Sharp Carousel model, so I give it thumbs up.  Yes, you do hear the humming of a microwave oven, but it is low level and I think it is expected.  As for ease of use, yes the bottom two icons can be confusing at first, but once you read the manual (I wonder if owners read the manual before they start complaining about how difficult it is to use) and follow the instructions, and get used to the control panel, it turns out that it is easy to use.I am very pleased with the popcorn option.  My Sharp Carousel had a difficult time popping popcorn without burning 10% of the popcorn.  Or when I tried to time it to not burn, there were quite a few kernels not popped.  This Toshiba to my surprise at it at 1:45 minutes for 3.5 oz bag and it popped 99% if not 100% of the kernels and not of them were burnt.  That is enough for me to buy this model.This is only my first day of unpacking, setting it up and using it to heat some water for tea and pop one bag of pop corn, but so for I really like my investment in this microwave oven.  I will continue to use it and  if I have any issues or praises in the coming weeks, I will certainly write a more complete review.So far, it is 5 stars for me ... and it only costed me $169.99.  That is a good price and it is sizeable for a family of 5.Now, with more usage, (updated review - part 2) I used the reheat feature and I was half expecting to set the time, but it did not require setting the time.  I then patiently waited for it to reheat my dinner from the night before with its smart sensor feature.  When it was done, it then went into the mode of returning the plate to its original position (which was not necessary because it was a circular plate), but the dinner was heated evenly.  Another plus.  And the noise level was low.  So far, so good."
5,"This is a quality oven.  The color is unusual and looks good on the cupboard.  The timer has a nice ring sound.  The rack and inside is easy to clean.  For 1,000 watts, it heats/cooks quickly and evenly.  I would buy it again."
2,I purchased this due to an on-line review.  I'm not happy with this.  I do not recommend it. My 700 watt machine works better than this.
4,"I bought this based on the Wirecutter recommendation. It's a great looking microwave and the size is perfect for our small cabin's kitchen. It's also priced really affordably, which is nice. But it does have a few quirks. The popcorn button/function is either faulty on our unit or useless. On our unit, the popcorn button only sets the time to about a minute and pops almost none of the actual kernels. We need to manual adjust the time and listen for the pop frequency to slow down so we know when to take the popcorn out. I'm used to doing it this way, so it's not that big a deal, but it would have been nice to have a working popcorn setting. Also, we find that the rotating center plate comes off its tracks a lot, which requires that it be manually placed back. This may be due to the microwave being placed slightly higher than normal (on top of a small fridge, instead of on a counter, due to lack of available counter space. But it has been happening often enough that I thought it should be mentioned.But the unit does cook evenly, in our experience, with fairly uniform temperature on reheated food. It's slightly less powerful than some competitors (900W vs. 1050 or even 1200 watts on some competitive models), but this isn't a major drawback for us. Also, most of the 1200W models are much larger so they wouldn't be as convenient. Overall, we're pretty happy with the purchase, with the exception of the useless popcorn mode."
1,This cheap microwave doesn’t warm up anything. Upset I got rid of my other microwave. Save your money and buy something else
2,"product came on time , but upon unpacking it , the microwave had a burnt electrical smell inside"
2,"PROS:It's a microwave and it seems to work at a level that matches its power rating.It's sleek looking and isn't loud.It has a rotating plate and always comes back to the same place.CONS:The buttons are terrible and difficult to use.  They are off-center; pressing squarely on the number on the button, nothing happens.  You have to aim 1/4in (3mm) off.  Very annoying, do not buy, (or plan on peeling the sticker off and re-centering it).  I'm not the only one with this complaint, so they may be a common problem.The beep alert for the microwave process completing is long and quite loud.  This might work for you.Final say:Buy a different product unless you are ready to compensate for the poorly-aligned buttons for as long as this microwave lasts."
1,"Started sparking during use after 3 months. Do not recommend it.The warranty process was cumbersome, but I am promised a refund."
1,The microwave caught on fire the company won’t answer the phone
4,"I have used it a few times and it seems pretty powerful. I was unaware of the restrictions about where it could sit so had to figure out a place for it other than where I had planned. The 3 inches behind it and air movement for each side made it difficult in my small kitchen. Also, wasn’t aware of wiping it out when something produces a lot of steam.  The microwave has to be placed away from a tv.  People may know this but I did not. I thought the buttons where lit but only the clock/timer lights up. I still like the microwave and am pleased with the performance."
3,"I have had it for 11 days now (arrived 3/31/20).  Old microwave pooped out during the shelter in place orders, so I ordered this microwave online.  Arrived and had a pretty dim display and on about day 3 the display went almost black to barely visible when looking at the display at just the right angle.  Making do with the microwave for now, and hope to have it serviced when possible.  Other than the display, it works.  Tempted to just open it up and solder that lose connection, but don't want to void the warranty.  Disappointed that connection was so poorly done that I assume it shook lose during shipping.Update:  Went to Panasonic website to look up servicer in my area and link for searching for that is broken.  Emailed customer service since I was contacting in the afternoon on Pacific time and they were on east coast time and closed.  Email answered by bot since it was obvious a person didn't read because it just sent me a general reply containing the broken link that I referenced as broken in my email.  About to call customer service but 6/25/20 the display comes on out of the blue fully bright.  This is definitely making me question the wiring in the display.  I imagine the display will hold out just until the warranty will be up."
4,Works a little slowly.But I like it.
3,"I think this is a beautiful and well designed microwave, but I don't like how the screen is so dim at certain angles. It's hard to read in the daytime. It is also pretty loud. I have to return it because of that. Otherwise it's great."
2,"OK! Listen Up! Needed a new microblaster that is large and this one fills the bill.I have owned two other Panasonic ovens in the past and both failed because of broken door latches.This one is no different. I have been using it for two weeks and the door is already hanging up.The rest of the machine is excellent. Large size, well finished, lots of power, large turntable, easy to use controls.The reason I purchased this particular machine was because Amazon offered it up at the ridiculously  low price of 150.00 delivered.The door is of the same design as my other Panasonics so if it follows the same progression the door will completely fail in a few years.The Panasonic is replacing a large Sharp machine that lasted for 12 years. The Sharp door is well designed and served me well. The magnetron failed from normal heavy use.If Panasonic ever gets around to figuring out a good door design they might have a good durable machine.If you dont mind spending a couple hundred dollars more buy the Sharp or you can take a chance like I did"
5,It's the perfect size for that small countertop!
3,"We have this unit on a microwave shelf in our kitchen.  The display is so dark that my husband can't read it at all and I have a very hard time with it.  The ""inverter"" feature for defrosting seems to be pretty much a nothing burger.  It defrosts about the same as my previous microwave.  I don't like the way it does the presets.  If your choice is #10 on their list, you have to hit the button 10 times... and if you go over, you have to start again.  My last unit, I just plugged in the number for the preset I wanted.  All in all, I'm not in love with this unit, but it does the job of microwaving, so......."
1,stopped working after less than 2 months.  How do I return as a warranty claim?
1,"Because this was recommended to me by friends and family, I ignored the bad reviews and ordered this microwave. Ordered on Aug 6, 2020; mid-October it started screeching and banging like it was going to blow up. It was past the return window but since Farberware has a LIFETIME limited warranty and since it had only been 2 months since purchase I started trying to contact Farberware and Edge Consumer Brands (which is listed on the Warranty document). It's now November 5th and I have yet to be able to get through to anyone. Emails ro Edge returned as undeliverable; Farberware customer relations (recorded message) told me to call Edge and THAT phone # tells me that I’ve reached a number that is not available from my calling area (WHAT??); the phone # for Edge on the Warranty gives me: “Not assigned yet"" - again (What??). This is ridiculous. They give you NO way to get in touch with them about a warranty.  I'll never buy a Farberware product again!!"
4,"Nice style, looks great on the counter, the 1.6 cubic inches has plenty of space for oversized plates , heats food evenly, gave it only 4 stars because Tashiba came up short on the foot pads , they should use rubber instead of plastic, when you open the door the unit slids forward when you open the door, I solved this problem by cutting 4 squares from a rug stop slip pad and placed them under the feet, works great"
3,"The microwave is fine except I wish the numbers and letters were larger.  My only complaint was the delivery.  It was shipped USPS and they couldn’t fit it into our mailbox……. We had to go to our post office and pick it up.  We are in our 80s, so not so easy to do."
2,"First impression: looks good, the controls are easy to use, the price is low.But... it has some problems. It doesn't cook evenly. The first thing I tried, was a frozen Burrito. After 2 minutes I could see cheese melting out of the ends. Nothing unusual with that.  After I cut into it, I found the center, was still frozen.Granted, this is a low power oven, so I gave it another 30 Seconds. But still the center was frozen and the ends were very hot.I gave it away and bought a GE that was a little bigger and has more power."
1,Zero stars! Don’t buy this product! We’ve had it one month and it doesn’t work anymore. You cook food for minutes on end and it’s still cold. Really upset the return window is already up.
3,Numbers on dial hard to read . Dark on dark.
3,"I loved it when it arrived! It is beautiful, runs smoothly and the motor (fan) is very quiet. BUT after about a month it started making a horrible noise. It sounds like popcorn popping while the turntable is going around. In fact, it does have something to do with the turntable not fitting properly, OR the fitting not correct for the turntable. It is embarrassing, and maddening. I hate using it now. Had I known about this, there is no way I would have purchased this one. And I used to think Farberware was a great product - wrong!"
4,"Purchased for Grandson’s dorm room , everything’s good so far ."
3,"Needs better packaging, unfortunately. The first thing I see when I open the box is cracked glass. There was barely anything protecting the glass tray, but I figured that it would be easy to replace. So I take out the rest of the microwave and realize that it’s dented on the top. I’m over itJust check it for damage. Otherwise, very cute! Maybe might try to purchase again if I can’t find a cuter microwave"
5,"Seems to be a good microwave.  Works like a microwave is supposed to.  I barely use a microwave but it's convenient to have.  For me, it's mostly a clock, and I'll use it to heat water for tea.  Looks almost exactly like my last microwave, which was an Emerson.  I didn't like my Emerson microwave.  I had two fail (same or very similar model) within 5 years.  Not sure if Faberware and Emerson are related, but this new one REALLY looks like my last two.  I don't want to prejudge my Faberware microwave on my last two crappy microwaves, so I'll give it 5-stars and cross my fingers that I don't have to change that."
2,The Plastic that is over the numbers are pealing off and they are not suppose to. Very disappointed in product. I need to return it.
5,Nothing to say about it I love it and it was a good deal I can't complain about it
4,"Ever tried to heat a bowl of creamed wheat cereal in a microwave? If so, you've probably had fun cleaning up the mess it makes when it boils over. Or maybe you just watched it like a hawk, your finger on the STOP button. If you tried to set the POWER to, say, 50% so it would heat slower, you no doubt discovered that it DOESN'T HEAT SLOWER. It takes more time to heat the food, but it's not putting in 50% power. Instead, ""conventional"" microwave ovens just turn the power on and off so it takes twice as long, but it's at 100% when it's on. This means that your cup of coffee sits there, with the power off, for a few seconds, and then gets a blast of full power for a few seconds. When it's near boiling, the next 100% blast makes it boil right out of the cup. With hot cereal, it's even worse, because the blast that takes it to a boil may well make it swell up into a large blob of cereal and spill all over the turntable.In other words, conventional microwaves can't heat something GENTLY. Slowly, yes, if you mean pulsing maximum power with longer or shorter ON and OFF cycles. My induction cooking surface has the same problem. I want to simmer -- but I can't. Boil rice and leave it on low? No can do -- when turned down to 10% heat, it blasts the pot at 100% for 3 seconds, and then turns off for 30 seconds. But during the 3 seconds on MAX, the rice boils over. It's horrible.The Panasonic ""Inverter Technology"" doesn't have this problem because it actually DOES turn down the power.If I set it to power level 5, for 3 minutes, it runs at half power for 3 minutes, just like any sane person would expect. It doesn't run at 10 for ten seconds and then turn off for ten seconds, again and again. So the food never gets hit with excessive heat. Warm something at minimum heat? Easy. Power level 1. Gently warm the food for a few minutes without FRYING it for a few seconds every minute.I don't know why all the other microwave mfrs don't do it this way. It makes a HUGE difference in the usefulness of a microwave oven.I dropped one star for a few usability reasons:1. The power level settings don't make a lot of sense -- 5 doesn't seem to mean 50%, and so you have to get accustomed to what the 10 levels really correspond to.2. .The interior light should be brighter. Even with Inverter Technology, sometimes you really need to see what's going on inside.3. The button panel logic requires more button presses than necessary for some common functions. My old oven had 1-6 buttons just turn the thing on at max power for that many minutes. It's a small gripe, but hey, the thing is close to being perfect.4. It's a bit loud, fan-wise, but I don't bake things in it for long periods (e.g., potatoes), so I don't mind much.5. I really love the ""turntable memory"" feature some other brand offers -- for example, if you put in a pyrex measuring cup for any length of time, when it finishes, the turntable keeps turning until it's in the same position as when you started. So the measuring cup's handle is still facing the door. Nice. Am I fussy to want this? Just so I don't have to reach in and twirl the hot container so I can reach the handle? Maybe.In any case, I have no problems with fit and function. I haven't tried the smart mode where it senses steam to adjust cooking time, because the user guide was a bit confusing, and I already know how I want to cook things. Trusting the oven to get it right would require some experiments, and I don't want to waste food or time on that. So it gets 4 stars, but the Inverter Technology gets 10 stars. It's a must-have feature."
3,Not bad for a small microwave.
1,"Started arcing behind perforated right interior wall about 60 days after getting this in Sept. of 2018. It was pretty random at first. Sometimes just heating some water for tea in the same type of cup that I had used previously without a problem. When it is arcing there is visible electrical arcs seen through perforations and the noise it makes is really scary-think Young Frankenstein when they are bringing the monster to life.  This has just gotten worse and worse until now, the only way to not have it arc is removal of platter and plastic ring with wheels that the platter would normally rest on and placing the object or cup or measuring cup right next to that wall.  I read lots of reviews in this price range and it seems as though with all of the brands, it’s a crap shoot. I don’t know what is so hard about building one of these that will last. I have had 2 microwaves before this and neither were priced much above this one and they both lasted over 8 years. If the arcing had only started sooner I would have asked Amazon to return it. As it is, looks like I’ll be shopping for a new one before 1 year into this one."
1,"Ignore my previous review. We set the oven on an upholstered bench while we were painting the kitchen. We baked a potato for lunch, and that is when the oven overheated. We did not realize we had cut off the airflow.I apologize for my review. We were at fault."
5,Great product
3,"You get a brief pamphlet with purchase. Several places tell you can get a paper copy on how too use the microwave, It's 4 in 1. After much difficulty I spoke too a manager and asked for a paper manual, was told they don't do that anymore even thought it says they do. I was told to go too the library  and she if they would print it for me. Do you think I'll buy another GE product?"
2,"It's so loud, i would have returned it but I had already thrown the box out before I tryed  it out. 😔"
5,Small space saving counter top microwave.  Has room for a full size dinner plate. Powerful enough to work well.  Glad I bought it.  Simple control's.
5,"It works very well, and made good."
4,"I purchased this in 2016 and it has lasted well since then. I just noticed that the ""start"" button no longer works, so I cannot use it anymore. I have been mostly pleased with it with a few exceptions. I noticed right away that it does not have any ""quick"" buttons. It does have one that says ""Quick 30"" but you still have to press the ""Start"" button for it to work. It does add 30 seconds to something that is already cooking but I missed the auto-start feature and now I really miss it because without the 'Start' button working, nothing works. One con is that the door is kind of hard to close. When I close it, it pushes the microwave back because of the stiffness of the latch, and this is since 2016, with multiple daily usage."
4,It was smaller than expected.
4,Even though the sizes are given it’s better to get the bigger design this one looks like the size of a toaster oven
2,Light burned out in 3 months and is very loud!
1,"The package did not seemed damaged at all, but the product had big dent and the door had some details as well, might have not noticed if it did not have the big dent on the top, but it certainly did not look as a brand new product. Returned."
1,Shipped without the ring that keeps the plate inside stable so now I have to find the right one to buy since support has been useless.  1 star
3,I use my microwave to thaw and reheat meals that I have frozen. The Panasonic I replaced and gave away did a PERFECT job at defrosting and sensor cooking.  I wish I would have kept it.The Turbo frost does not do the job I have to check it and check just like back when you put meat in to defrost using high or med and dared not walk away or you would have cooked chicken instead of thawed chicken.Also after a cycle is done you have to push stop even though it is finished to start a new thing.the sensor cook like for frozen entree boils stuff.I am not pleased and would not recommend this product.
4,Microwave is very nice missing two things the volume of the beep is too low and there is not a quick press for like 3 minutes which is 3 and it starts
5,"This is a good microwave overall.  The controls are a bit less intuitive than an older unit I had, which takes a little getting used too.  It is sleek.  Quiet.  Several auto settings that are very useful, although the pizza setting resulted in a very rubbery crust, and I will not use it to reheat pizza again.  But, it warms leftovers (other than pizza) very well, which is my dominate usage.  More compact sized unit and 1000 watts.  It seems to have good insulation, as I have noticed that my wifi signal no longer gets interrupted by the microwave running. Which was a real problem with the old unit….hmmm, probably should have replaced the old unit sooner, right?It has auto settings for beverages, potato, popcorn, veggies, pizza (not using that one again), and leftovers and some programmable options for favorites.  It does have the turn table.  You can adjust the power settings and timer settings. Defrost function too.So. Overall, this is a very good microwave!  Except for warming pizza… (sheesh, enough with the pizza already)."
2,Was good while it lasted.Bought Sept 11 2018.Died July 10 2022.Maybe I'm just getting old... but that doesn't seem enough life to be worthy.Or the fact that the unit it replaced was bought in 1999 and still worked in 2018...Buyer beware. If you like me want to get more than 4 years out of a microwave buy something else or buy this one at c0stco where if it breaks you can return it and they will replace it or give you your money back.Best return policy out there.
1,"The media could not be loaded.I initially really liked this little microwave. It’s compact ~ a space saver and got the job done. I’m a senior and all I do is warm water for my instant coffee in the morning and dinner at night. Not even 9 months old and the door latches just “quit” working. They won’t lock. Extremely disappointed that unless I’m able to find someone who can recycle the metal, it’s very disheartening that this may become landfill. Shame on this company for selling a piece of trash ~ literally"
5,Just the right size for my space.
1,Failed at first attempt to use !
4,"UPDATE:  The grill function shorted out exactly 2 years after I got it, burning out a ground fault interrupter in the process. The electrician’s bill was higher than the price of the oven. Good thing I had a gfi! When I removed it from the counter, I also discovered the mess in the photo. The oven is too heavy to move regularly to clean, although I did wipe up the counter under the edge of the door fairly often and wondered where the stuff I wiped was coming from. I bought it mostly to avoid having both a toaster oven and a microwave on my counter. It made halfway decent light toast from a frozen slice, although that took 11 minutes, and the Combi setting was helpful for crisping the edges of pie crust on reheated quiche. (Both of those things can be done better and faster by an air fryer that I bought more recently. An air fryer  is just a convection oven with a small footprint - who knew?) The interior light never worked. BOTTOM LINE: having tried two combinations ovens from two different manufacturers, I conclude that combining a microwave with an oven function is a technology not yet perfected. At least the price of this one wasn’t as high as the first one!ORIGINAL POSTI just got this, replacing a convection microwave whose heating element died. It was a great price, under $100 - I don’t know whether that will remain in effect. Controls are much simpler than the convection/microwave unit, which was ridiculously complicated. I haven’t tried to clean it, but it looks ordinary. The four stars reflect a very minimal interior light and, especially, a really inadequate manual, especially concerning the grill. I want to toast bread - my old oven took 10 minutes to defrost and just barely crisp a slice of frozen bread on grill feature, with no browning. This oven has a Grill setting and 2 Combi grill and microwave functions. No information about how to use the Combi settings or how they differ.Fairly extensive online research suggests preheating the grill for 1 minute. The grill and oven definitely get hot, leading to risk of skin burns (!) if you touch the interior or the metal grill after using the Grill feature. Grilling a slice of frozen bread without preheating is slower than a toaster would be. The combo alternates microwave with grill function (both the sound and the lighted icons indicate this), but the bread is tough and not yet browned. There appear to be 2 levels of Combi, but I have no idea why.TOAST TEST: good news! When I Grill a frozen piece of bread for 8 minutes, the top is slightly crisp and the bottom is moist like fresh bread. After 12 minutes, the top (facing the roof, where there is an oven-type element) is slightly brown. Perfect light toast color and crunch. The underside is slightly crisp although not brown. Flipping mid-cycle may result in equal sides but I haven’t tried that. CAUTION: Use tongs or risk serious burns.Combi is not useful, overcooks the bread in the center and leaves it tough. It’s probably great for thawing and “browning” a frozen pizza or casserole. I have not seen evidence that the metal grill rack gets hot enough to leave marks on the food - maybe with more time."
4,Great!
2,"This thing worked okay until it died on us after less than two years of use.  The turntable still turns and the light comes on, it makes the cooking noises, but doesn't heat anything.  Their outsourced to India customer service was friendly enough, but not helpful since the warranty is a measly one year.  I guess this falls into the category of you get what you pay for.  It's also a bit weak--I would have to set it for slightly longer than whatever a package instructed.  Also, just a personal pet peeve--I hate it when microwaves keep beeping after you open the door.  If I'm right there when it ends, and I pop the door open, shut up."
1,"I am very disappointed with this microwave.First impression: compact, sleek looking, just the right size for what we need, it is perfect.We have always realized it was not the quietest but now it seems as though the inside glass tray no longer fits correctly. It makes an annoying noise when it is on and the sound of the screeching turntable is awful.If I could return, I would."
4,This works great. I like the versatility but agree with other reviewer who said the panel needs to be lit. Forget using it at night unless you turn the lights on fully or if there isn't a lot of light in the room. Absolutely cannot read the panel.
5,"Awesome microwave. It is a little small, but it's my wife and i and we usually only use it for popcorn, leftovers, or Top Ramen lol. But it does the job. So if you're looking for a nice looking microwave that won't take a whole bunch of counter space and actually cooks your food, go for it. And not to mention this was friendly on our budget :)"
5,Good
3,Not sure how long these last but mine only lasted 3 years. Worked great but disappointed
5,"Very good microwave. Had it almost for a month now and it still works perfectly fine. I dont use it for heavy cooking, I mainly use it to heat up little stuff. This is basically all it's going to do is heat up something little like TV dinners or hot beverages. It's pretty small mainly for 1 person. Make sure you put it somewhere where the cabinets are high."
5,"I bought this as a replacement for one I bought from Walmart. The buttons are pretty programmed for an easy cook time if it's something simple. While the one it replaced couldn't melt ice, just keep in mind that you're going to need at least a minute for the absolute hell fire to cool off of your food before you try to eat or drink. 1:45 needs at least 1:15 to cool off enough for cup noodles. Otherwise,  you're going to get burned"
3,I bought this product in 2019 and this morning I woke up to use it and it had no light. I could tell a couple months ago that it was going bad because it wasn’t heating things up as it use to I would have to allow it to go for a longer time.
4,"Very small footprint, but layout & buttons similar to larger models. Since it's lower power, it does take a few seconds longer. Will not hold a full size dinner plate, but our medium size Corelle plates fit. Our over-the-range model quit during the pandemic, and this one will tide us over, & then be a good extra one."
2,"The turntable clunks, if I put something weighing more than 2.5 lbs it turns back and forth a couple inches one way, then a couple inches the other- over and over endlessly.The lining on the inside of the door buckles.This is definitely a strong microwave, we use it mostly at 70% power level.I love the size, but can’t use it for anything large, as the turntable won’t work!  Our plastic no splash lid only works if it fits the outside diameter of the dish used.  If it is on the outside of the dish (sits on the glass turntable) the microwave fills with steam & liquid.  Also, on full power brand name Glad Cling Wrap melts!  It is easily wiped clean.  Would not buy it again."
3,Surprised by lack of power. Just takes longer to cook and heat items. Love the small size though.
5,I highly suggest this product.  The inside is super easy to clean.  Setting choices are nice and fairly easy to see.
1,"Had it just at 3 months, sucker just tripped the electric switch, and died I waited to submit my review based on Panasonic support. But after more than 2.5 months of waiting for even a follow up. I can safely say Panasonic doesn't care about their customers. Buy any other brand of microwave, but don't waste your time or money on Panasonic. They won't help, even with covid-19 going on, 2.5 months is too long to wait for some kind of answer. I have been emailing them biweekly to try to motivate but no response from them at all. One star is too kind, If I could I would give them negative stars for this microwave and their lack of support."
2,A couple months in and this thing is already dying. It is also quite anemic - it is advertised as 900w but is probably closer to 600w.
2,"Toshiba ML-EC42P(SS) Microwave Oven with Healthy Air Fry, Smart Sensor, Easy-to-Clean Stainless Steel Interior and ECO Mode, 1.5 Cu.ftI had to have some time to write this review, first I think toshiba makes very products, I am happy with my toshiba microwave, the biggest problem with it is, that is sold as having air fry feature, and it does not, it does have a convection oven, which for the most part is an air fryer. Toshiba went as far as to put a “air fry” button on the front control panel. When you press the “air fry” button the convection oven will turn on, there are no other air fry settings on this unit at all. Only the air fry button on the front panel (pic included). This in my opinion is false representation on the part of toshiba.I have read the manual from front to back cover, there are no “air fry” instructions, no additional settings for the air fry selection. And for this reason I would give it a 2 star rating. Without a doubt whoever wrote this instruction manual needs to never write another instruction manual. The manual is the worst I have ever had to read and use.The other item on the front panel that is terrible is the number display, (you can see the clock) for whatever reason toshiba decided to make the number display all blue light numbers and it is very difficult to see and use. Some of the other lights on the same panel for instance when you push the infamous air fry button, a tiny little blue square indicator lights up that says “conv” meaning convection oven and it is so small you cannot really see what it says. Unacceptable.As for the actual microwave oven performance it works very well, it is powerful and does a good job. I think toshiba dropped the ball on this unit."
5,"We had a 25 year old Panasonic 1100 watt that was still going strong, but reheating leftovers was always a challenge to get the center warm without the outside edged begin scorching hot.  Figured it was time to try out a new microwave and this microwave is much better at evenly heating up leftovers.  So far, it works great with reheating leftovers and making popcorn.  The popcorn settings are perfect for the two size settings we’ve tried.  My only nitpick is that the stainless button to open the microwave shows fingerprints way too easily.  That is a high contact area that should have a fingerprint-free panel installed."
4,"This was a gift, and the receiver likes it"
4,Item works and quality condition
3,"It only makes one beep sound when it's  done and that's  it. It don't  have a reminder sound that the food is done. We tend to forget that there's  something we left in the microwave. Our old one, it beeps many times till we get our food out."
5,"So far, so good with this microwave, which I have been using for about a month.  It has the features I was looking for (including a soften/melt button) is easy to use and has plenty of space inside.  The only complaint is that I can't cook at the same time the timer is being used.  Some reviews mentioned the noise.  Mine runs quietly.  The door does ""clank"" shut, but it doesn't bother me.  If someone is sleeping, I close the door almost all the way, then gently push it in the rest of the way, using both hands so it makes little noise.  Now I just hope it lasts a long time!"
4,A little larger than I would have liked but is workable
4,Single dad apartment quality. It’s fine. Not big. Not fast. Just fine. Good price though
5,this was just the size I wanted for my counter since I am widowed and don't need large ones any longer.
5,"My old 1250 watt mega-huge microwave was showing it's age and making groaning sounds and I needed to replace it. Quite happy with this 900 watt microwave, easy to operate, door opens easily and it takes the same amount of time to heat up my morning coffee as my 1250 monster did! It's much lighter, takes up a minimum of counter space and looks really snappy in my kitchen!"
5,"I travel for a living which leads to unhealthy eating and bad cooking habits so I use Factor75 when I’m home for a healthier diet. Considering I’m gone a lot, my sister stops by on the Factor delivery days and puts my meals in the freezer for me (note, Factor75 is a fresh never frozen fully cooked weekly meals delivery service - not recommended to freeze.)When I return home, I simply put a frozen Factor meal into this Panasonic Inverter microwave and use sensor setting 6 for frozen meals and the meal comes out at perfect temp and quality every time. Note, if you store your Factor meals as recommended in the fridge, and do not freeze them, you can simply cook them on high for 2 minutes for perfect meals.From my experience, the sensor setting for frozen meals on this microwave is very fast. Other microwaves require you follow the typical printed heating times. Ex, cook 4 minutes remove film stir replace cook 3 minutes etc. The frozen meals time I’ve experienced with this microwave sensor setting have never taken more than 4 minutes."
2,The glass plate does not stay on the turn table
2,"I replaced my 10 year old Sharp Carousel 1100 watt when it started making noise and heating unevenly with this Panasonic. Needing at least 1100 watts I was happy to find this unit as it was one of the few 1100-1200 watt compact countertop units in a 12 x 20 x 15 size available. After reading the manual and placing the new microwave, I couldn't wait to try it. I have these whole grain  Kodiak muffins that cook in one minute in their own cup. After adding water and stirring, I put it in the microwave and set it at full power for 1 minute. I was immediately assaulted by a noise that sounded like a screaming tornado in a wind tunnel. This can't be right, but I left the muffin in for the allotted minute. When removed I noticed it was still liquid in the center and the cup was very hot on the bottom & cool on the top. I made these all the time in my old 1100 watt Sharp and they always tasted and came out great. I let the cup sit to hopefully continue baking, but it never happened. The muffin stayed raw in the center and the cooked part tasted awful. At 1200 watts, this microwave should have outperformed my 1100 watt Sharp, but it didn't. It may be defective, I don't know. The wind noise was so loud I left the kitchen thinking it might blow up. It actually sounded and acted like the Sharp I was replacing due to suddenly acquired noise and failure to heat properly.  Before giving up and sending it back, I'll try calling Panasonic and see what they can do. I have had Panasonic's before and this unit was recommended by several sources. It's nice looking , has insufficient lighting, but mostly , I just wish it worked."
3,"Started radiating heat / not blocking microwave signal, noticed 2.5 years in, was likely a problem since at least 1.5 years in. Not thrilled"
4,good buy
2,The turntable does not fit securely. It wobbles while turning around.
5,"This Panasonic microwave replaced another Panasonic we had for years, but we broke the turntable and couldn't locate any replacements. This unit is very close to the one we had, so there was pretty much no learning curve.I like that the wattage is the more typical 1200 (previous was 1300, so had to fudge times a bit) so it's easy to figure cooking times as most products list directions for that wattage.I also like that the former 1-minute button is now a 30-second button. If you do need to run for a minute, just press that button twice. Easy-peasy.Cooking is even, oven is pretty quiet and controls are easy to figure out.The one drawback for me is that the light stays on when the door is open. Previously, we'd leave the door ajar after cooking to let it air out, but now we have to get into the habit of closing it so the light doesn't stay on. Minor gripe - and not enough to drop a star - but would definitely appreciate Panasonic going back to the light only on during the cooking process.Overall, we're very pleased with this new model and hope to use it for many years to come."
3,"After receiving two different damaged ovens, each with a different point of damage, I am returning the last one. If the quality control over outgoing product were better, this might be a good purchase."
3,It’s an ok microwave. Standard not top of the line. But it is VERY NOISY
5,Their was not a instruction manual about the microwave
4,"The unit works well for most functions and is fairly easy to use if you have read the directions. Unfortunately, the control panel is a mess for the laminate over the buttons has begun to peel badly. Very frustrating since we have only had for 9 months."
1,Very bad product...AVOID!
3,"Container should 1000 W, wanted 1100 W."
2,"Nice over all, BUT - it makes a constant rattling noise that drives me up the wall...I probably won't buy from Farberware again."
1,"When we got this, we opened it up and everything was packaged nice and neatly. Everything looked good! Then we plugged it in. This is when everything went south. First, we tried to set the clock per the instructions. I've set clocks on every other device I have ever owned. It wouldn't set. The buttons were not reactive. Then we turned on the microwave. It sizzled and cracked and sounded like it had metal inside the unit. Scared my wife to death!! And I'm pretty sure if we kept using it, someone might be getting sued! It's dangerous! I wouldn't buy this again for anything!!"
2,"touch pad stiff, slow to register input #'s missalighned with buttons....assuming you get it programmed (doubtfull)  it will start vibrating loudly 1 minute into the cycle.  I heat 1 cup of water for coffee per day out in the shop......wife made me fix the old one...won't have anything to do with this one!  Too bad, its a nice looking machine...."
5,Like the stainless steel and black look
5,"I like it as I just use it to warm food, water or make pop corn. Have to watch the popcorn bag because sometimes it get stuck. Better to use small popcorn bags."
2,Arrived heavily dented. Works good. Hoping the damage doesn’t affect the use in the future.
5,This combo is fantastic.We are a family of 3 that uses this daily.Comes with appropriate racks and a pan for air frying.
1,"I used it a few times.  No problem.  Tried making popcorn- noticed it was not popping and the unit was VERY HOT!  Then… it died, and of course the return window had expired one month ago.Not happy."
2,"Microwave works well, the issue is that every time I need to do something simple, I have to read the instructions. Most microwaves have a popcorn button. Not this one. It is about as complicated as it gets. How about setting a timer? Forget about it. Back to the manual I go. Where is the start button. Nope, not happening. You have to decipher which one it is. Want to cancel something. Go read the manual. I am smarter than the average bear and this microwave is impossible to figure out."
5,"Exactly what I want, everything is perfect, fit, looks ❤️, the whole package, thank You so Much for payments, Thank You n God Bless 🌟🕊️🙏"
5,The media could not be loaded.Lo recomiendo muy buena elección k ara si compra esta msrcas
5,I got this for another area of the house so it's not so noisy where my bedroom is if people want to make something at night. It's important for me to have a good microwave in my home and this one fits the bill. It is worth every penny because it works great and there are no flaws everything works as it should so far.I'd say the only problem I've had so far with it is that it is bigger than I thought it would be but it's the size of most microwaves I've used so hat's not too terrible. It wasn't damaged or anything so the packaging was good and that's a bonus since I've had things delivered lately that have been damaged quite a bit.All in all this is a great microwave with a lot of settings. I generally just use the timed aspect of it but they have all kinds of settings like a crisp setting which a family member told me is like an air frying type of thing but I'm old school with cooking in my microwave and don't know anything about settings besides what my family says.
3,"Light weight, looks great and works great but sounds like it’s going to break down at any minute... still works months later but sounds funny"
1,"I received BLACK+DECKER EM036AB14 back in September of last year, and the unit operated flawlessly.That is until last month, when the unit started up by itself and none of the controls would work. Had to unplug the microwave, as it was now a hazard.I have gotten a full refund from the manufacture. I am now shopping for a new unit that will hopefully last, at least a couple of years"
5,I purchased  this microwave oven after doing a lot of research and it has paid off. What a great product. The design is exceptional. It is the best looking microwave I have ever owned. It looks great on the counter and is very easy to clean. It is extremely simple to use and is very quiet. I just can't say enough good things about it except I would recommend this product very highly. Black & Decker got it right with this one. I couldn't be happier with this wonderful appliance.
1,"The digits don’t work (see pic), the temperature isn’t consistent, the glass falls off track almost every time and you have to push the keypad so hard that the whole microwave is shoved."
2,It looks very cheap. The glass turn plate keeps coming off when you use it. Hate it..waste of my money!
1,"I too checked for a protective cover over the buttons, but nay. We have to use a flashlight to see, no start stop button/cancel. Lots of steam noticed for some reason. Can't envision spending the next three years or so not being able to see the function buttons or stop and clear. Will return this and shop again."
2,I bought this microwave because it was cheap (just being honest) but it does not work well at all.  Buy it if you're okay with needing to heat something up for double the time that it's supposed to take.
2,"Possible safety hazard. Product turned on by itself with the fan on, plate rotating and it seemed that the microwave was engaged. Would not recommend."
5,"We bought this to replace a slightly smaller one that was lower wattage. I am very please with its power level, and easy to use controls. The plus was the door doesn't have a phus button release. My last one did and the spring was wearing out. This one locks tightly, and we all like it."
1,"I liked the controls and ease of use, but it died at 2 years old. They have to do better than that."
3,Convenient worth the price i paid for it
2,After 2 years 4 months the magnetron failed.  The user manual said it had a 5 year warranty on the part. I took it to a Panasonic authorized repair center. They diagnosed the problem and contacted Panasonic. Panasonic would not honor the warranty and it was going to be $590 for the repair. I cut my losses and just paid $75  for the diagnosis. Will not be buying Panasonic again!
4,"It is really hard to find the right combination of small size yet powerful output microwave. This is it. I have owned this microwave for awhile (11 monthes?) and it works great! I don't cook full meals in it,  but I cook popcorn, defrost, reheat and love the one touch 30 sec button on start and the 1 min, 2 min etc buttons. I also like that it vents from the top not the sides. So I can put it right near the wall.  I have limited counter space. Perfect apartment microwave. Worth every dollar spent so far."
4,Sent as gift
3,I have to heart everything twice as long as I used to.  To me this was a waste of money. So I will wait till it dies hopefully soon! Then get something better!!
5,Got this to replace my 15 year old Microwave I have had it for over 1 year and I'm very happy with it ...
4,"It does what it is supposed to do, have had no problems with it so far, been using it regularly for nearly three months."
2,Worked fine for a year; looks nice on the counter.The numeric pad died after one year of moderate use.  Never had this happen before but I guess I got a lemon.
1,"This microwave literally blew up when my husband plugged it in the wall. Each time I tried to return this broken, defective product, the site would direct me to watch a video on how to fix the problem, rather than allow me to return this non-usable item. I teach and intended to take it to my elementary school. I am grateful I did not take this dangerous appliance around my students I am out money and very disappointed at the complete lack of customer service.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MICROWAVE!"
3,This microwave is normal size on the outside but small on the inside. A regular bag of popcorn can stop rotating because it gets stuck on the sides.
1,This microwave is dangerous and caught on fire when we tried to use the air fry option.
1,"Got to plug the unit in, attempt to read the poorly written manual.  It worked fine on several items we chose to cook (microwave function only).  The next day it blew a GFI circuit breaker without even being in the room or attempting to cook anything.  After that we couldn't even plug it in without throwing a breaker.  My specific unit appears to be very dangerous electrically.  How does that even happen after 1 day?"
1,"Lasted a year, piece of junk! It’s a nice small size, but went to reheat a sweet potato and it caught on fire."
1,The number pad did not work.
1,"I replaced a Samsung Microwave and put this GE Oven in its place. In the same exact spot in my kitchen, it is impossible to read the white button labels on this GE model without a flashlight. The same is true with my bright LED ceiling lights turned on or bright sunlight coming through my 4 kitchen windows. The touch panel is not backlit according to GE and neither was its Samsung predecessor. I had no problem seeing the white lettering in the labels on the Samsung. I will be returning this GE Microwave because I do not want to have to shine a flashlight on the panel each time I use it.I bought this microwave because it was #8 in the list of popular microwaves on Amazon. I know the GE brand but this appliance is not the GE brand I grew up with. The brand is now owned by Haier.I wish I would have read the 1-star reviews where others complained about the exact same thing. I did not because the overall rating on this microwave was good. Perhaps there is a batch of ovens with incorrectly printed dark front panels.I will be returning this Microwave to Amazon. I seldom return anything I buy from Amazon. I love Amazon."
5,I was surprised when I opened my door to look out and find it in between my doors a day early. so I got it set up and used it when fixing my dinner. it's a little more powerful than my old one was I think and the door won't open as wide or stay open when fully opened so I can load or unload the microwave
4,"I love how tiny this is compared to our last microwave. My husband doesn't think it gets things as hot as fast as the one it replaced, but I am happy to wait a few seconds longer each time for all the counter space I got back."
5,"Unboxed this last night and discovered a dent.  (See photos)Don't discount the review after the first sentence, or let it sway you negatively.In an effort to leave the most accurate review, I am going to follow up this one with another after more usage and time under it.  Maybe 30 days.  That should do.The Dent.It arrived with a dent on the left top edge.We were a little disappointed and Leary of any dent on a microwave.We don't order appliances online or otherwise.  As a matter of factthis was the first microwave we ever ordered in our 30 year marriage.They've always been where we moved, so there was a bit of trepidation.Apparently, it's cosmetic and Amazon Customer Care gave us a $25 creditfor the issue, which I thought was fine.First Use:We boiled water.I know exciting right!!!It works.The inverter /  flex capacitor / core with dilithium crystals is magical.That water boiled faster than I have ever boiled water before.Next, we tried cream.  Cream is difficult in any situation.3.5 ounces in 20 seconds, and even heat through out.  Well done!Usually the top is hot and the bottom is cold and you have to put it in again.  (The cream)So far, we are pleased.Check back in 30 days!$150? I think that's great if it can last us a good long time.I don't fancy replacing another microwave, so here it goes!(Noise Level is going to be subjective, as will the User Interface)We could be wrong due to our inexperience with a plethora of microwaves.4 stars for now.The last photo is the ugly beast it is replacing, but inside the island instead.Wish us luck!*** We got a really cool hood / fan to replace the giant microwave pictured last ***"
5,"Needed a small micro for my daughter’s new apartment. Amazon made it easy to get a respected brand and quality product like B&D, next day delivery and didn’t have to hunt around town for a deal."
4,"Overall I like the device. Seems more powerful than my last one resulting in shorter cook times. And it's a little smaller than my last one, my counter space is limited. It's good to read the instructions because all the features aren't self-evident. Three things I don't particularly like though. Can't turn down the alarm volume and change the # of times it beeps. And door makes too much noise when closing it."
5,No problems and it is a lot stronger than my previous microwave.
2,This microwave is noisy with a loud fan and loud beeps that cannot be turned off. I have bought Panasonic microwaves in the past and loved them... this model is NOT the same. The Panasonic NN-SN736W model is larger but it is much quieter and the beeps can be turned off. The door latch has even been improved since previous models.
5,This is my second Panasonic Microwave with Inverter Technology.  I purposely bought it again.  My old one was still going strong but there were issues with the door latching - as others have reported.  It helps if you don't slam the door and if you gently open it.  It is a powerful microwave and it's large.  It holds my large casserole dishes.  For the money I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again despite issues with the door.
5,"The owner's manual for the Stainless Steel Countertop Panasonic Microwave Oven NN-SN686S says it requires a separate electrical circuit with no other appliances sharing it.  Indeed, if sharing, the microwave can blow a circuit.I bought the Stainless Steel Countertop Panasonic Microwave Oven NN-SN686S to replace my 38-year-old Quasar Microwave purchased in 1985. Yes. We had the amazing machine that long. You can imagine that anything replacing it has a hard act to follow, yet, the Panasonic Microwave Oven is holding its own.It is very powerful, heating a full, homemade dinner of meat, starch, and vegetable on a plate covered by a glass bowl in 1.5 minutes. Two stacked plates covered with bowls fully heat in 2.5 minutes.  As a rule, I cover anything to be heated with plastic wrap or something else to prevent spattering so the interior rarely needs cleaning.  When it does, all the pieces inside disassemble and reassemble with ease.The stainless steel and glass front are fingerprint magnets.  My only complaint is that the Owners Manual suggests cleaning the exterior door with water and a soft cloth. Clearly, the author never attempted this method. No one has ever removed greasy fingerprints from stainless steel or glass with water alone.  I would appreciate more candid instructions."
3,"Cooks food fine. A bit loud though. Feels a little cheap as well. But like I said in my title, it looks good if you need stainless steel appliances."
2,"Description says stainless, but it is painted.  Description says 1200 watts, yet it takes longer to boil a cup of water than my 10 tear old 1000 watt microwave.  Very annoying ""quick"" 30sec button requires the start button to be pressed after each entry.  The internal cavity coating seems quite thin, so thin that it will likely allow rust to form.  The unit rattles as if the screws are loose."
2,Product looks good and warms everything like expected but only lasted 45 days.  Woke up this morning won’t heat up and it’s only been 45 days sense I bought it.  So with all considered the product is junk and will not by again advise anyone else to do same.  Unless your microwave savy then you might get a few more days out of it
5,have had this microwave oven for a year or two no problem easy to use
3,Door is cheap and must be slammed.  New white LED light is cold color and not as bright as previous model.  Buttons are dark and lights must be on to use or to read any settings.  Also not marked well
5,"Purchased this for my older mother as she does not need a large microwave, nor one with a lot of bells and whistles.  A perfect fit for her space - she is thrilled with its quality."
3,"This microwave cooks evenly and is fairly quiet. Unfortunately the display started messing up after a month. The photo shows the clock which should read 9:57. Faberware offered to refund but no replacement, which is bad because the prices have gone up.  Gave 3 stars because the actual microwave works well."
1,"Noticed it was sweating a lot on the interior and the left side was too hot to touch, only after running for 5 min. No air moving near vents-researched it and apparently the fan is no longer working. Unacceptable for such a short time frame. Choose a different brand."
2,"I donot like the face that part of this product does not work and I have no recourse, I have to buy another one.  that really sucks."
1,I’m having a difficult time trying to return this item now UPS is saying I have to pay for the return
5,"I love it, it works smooth, has no issues, is a great size and power"
5,I love the sturdiness of this microwave. It heats quickly and efficiently.
4,"I don't know why, but the inside door holds a lot of moisture; this didn't happen with my other microwave. So I wipe it down and leave door open for a half hour."
3,"Honestly not as powerful as I expected, smelled a bit of styrofoam, not so much any more. Glad to have it now, Service Awesome, thank you Amazon!"
4,"It's huge! The defrost cooks the meat, but I may have done it wrong."
4,"I am not the end user of this product.  It was given as a gift.  It did arrive on tome and was in good condition.  It was unpacked, plugged in, and it works fine.  The only comment I got was ""I wish it was a little bigger, like my last one""."
5,We like this microwave. It is the perfect size. It's very quiet. The weight defrost function works great. The quick timer buttons are useful.
2,I bought this for my basement office. The power stinks. It takes 5 mins just to heat up my coffee in the mornings. Also it barely fits an extra large coffee mug.
1,"When trying to use the new item for the first time preparing ôThanksgiving dinner, the item wouldn’t turn on.Tried troubleshooting and item still wouldn’t work."
4,"Powerful and easy to understand what buttons do what, but it will burn your leftovers if you use the auto reheat options. Best to just do a time set so they don't burn."
4,Nice product and we have always favored  the Panasonic brand. This is the first time I have received a product with on owners manual and other papers. The box appeared to have never been opened.
2,"I needed a new microwave as my old one was on its last legs.  The price was good on this model and the right size to fit on a shelf over my kitchen counter.  I am not sure why, but I have lots of condensation build up inside the microwave and have to mop up that water almost every day.  Also the revolving glass plate that the food sits on keeps coming off of the place where it attaches to and I struggle to get it back in place.  The wheeled plastic ring that the plate sits on keeps slipping out of place as well.  I have no idea why this is happening, but I am so annoyed, I am thinking of getting rid of this and buying another brand.  It really is a nuisance."
5,We love it
1,"I struggled with 1 or 2 stars for this review.  It has been less than 3 years since I purchased this microwave and like some other reviews, I am now having to replace it because of rust issues on the interior.  The entire top has bubbling paint and rust now to the point where flakes are falling onto anything that gets microwaved.  I hadn't noticed it until recently but to be this bad the problem has to have been going on for a while.The microwave does its job as expected - but rusting on the inside after probably a year and a half or two?  Absolutely unacceptable.  I would look elsewhere."
3,It didn’t last long. Not sure what went wrong but I used as like you usually would a microwave. Not buying this brand again
3,"We wanted something that could hold a full-size dinner plate, which this does; did not take up a lot of space on the counter, which it does; and one with a feature where we could turn the beeping totally off, which this has. Too bad it is obvious that is not a very well made microwave, so if it lasts 6-12 months we will be surprised. The door is a tad loose (more so than our last unit, which was a different brand), but then so are a lot of microwave oven doors, just not as much as this unit. What bothered us most was that it wobbled a lot whenever we opened and closed the door. This was solved by placing soft plastic bumper pads on the 2 front feet. As for heating food or drink, so far it seems to be doing okay, and what we have prepared seems to have cooked/melted as usual, even though this unit has a lower power wattage than our last unit. Just have to adjust times is all."
2,"The settings on this thing are super frustrating, mediocre device. Would not buy this one again. Can never get the right time or setting. Hate this microwave."
4,"The oven works well and is easy to use but the display is absolutely useless.  No matter what you set it to do the display is uniformly a number of minutes and seconds counting down.  Select a cook time and press start or select a power level and a cook time and press start or select ""inverter turbo defrost"" and press start.  It's all the same display - a number of seconds counting down.  And since it's an inverter you can't tell the power level by listening to it turn on and off.  Did I remember to select a power level or is it on full power?  Is it defrosting or cooking?  Who knows?  Who cares?"
5,I have used this microwave to several months now and can report that daily use is convenient and easy to use. Heats consistently and I never have issues with functions or heating properly. One test I like to use it microwaveable popcorn. I experimented with time and got consistent results. Then I found the right timing and never looked back. Each bag pops nearly all the kernels and never burns it. That's worth the price alone to me.
3,"I almost gave it 2 stars. Closing the door on this thing sounds like closing a big, tin barn door; it is very loud. I wouldn't be surprised if my next-door neighbor can hear the door shut. It's also very loud the moment it starts heating. I've had it for less than 5 months. Works OK so far, but after reading how many people have had theirs last only days or weeks, I have to wonder how much longer it'll be till mine gives up the ghost. Twenty-first century economics: ""pay more, get less."""
1,Box damage old dry food on front of microwave dent on side
1,This microwave easily overheats and just off.  I tried to cook two microwaveable potatoes and after 14 minutes it overheated.  Would never buy this product again.
5,Excellent product. The compact size fit my limited kitchen space. Easy to use.
5,"Initial reactions to my new microwave:It's larger than expected, even though it says it's perfect for apartments and dorms. Larger than my last microwave.It's very heavy though. It is definately a countertop microwave and not a shelf microwave. Probably 34-40 lbs. For a new microwave, it seem s like a lot. The Amazon driver dropped the boxed microwave and broke my cement step. The microwave was not even damaged because it was packaged so well, but the unit is heavy.The Stainless Steel face is great for cleaning and very nice looking. The rest of the microwave is black.I would have liked the current 99.99 price, instead of the 109.99 price I paid. It went down in price the day after I bought it.Cooks frozen burritos thirty seconds faster than old microwave. (Granted, it's five years newer).Overall, I'm very pleased and impressed."
1,We ordered the first microwave and the turntable made a terrible noise and I knew that something.  Amazon replaced the item quickly but it stopped working after about 45 days. Do NOT buy!
2,"This microwave has a nice look to it, smaller then I was expecting but ok. It cooks food just fine, but the defrost feature sucks! It cooks the food every time which makes it difficult when trying to make burgers or anything really. Hate writing bad reviews,  but this is the truth.."
4,It's great other than the fact it doesn't give you an option for showing the time of day it is.
4,"Downsized from a full size microwave and love the smaller size. Plenty of room for a dinner plate. Works decent. Only complaint is you can't change power level mid-cook like my old microwave allowed. So, express cook shortcut can't be used for 4 minutes at power level 5. Instead lots of extra button pressing... ""time cook"" ""4"" ""0"" ""0"" ""power level"" ""5"" ""start""."
5,"Bought this for the office; small footprint, simple to work, quiet, works great.  Definitely recommend if you don't have a lot of space, but want a microwave."
5,"This microwave allows you to get rid of the annoying beeps when pushing the buttons and when it shuts off.  Don't understand why all microwaves don't have the option to get rid of them.  Anyway, been using this for a while and am very happy I purchased it.  It also runs quieter than my old microwave!"
1,"It was pretty good until it started heating plates & cups to the point that you needed a potholder to remove and the may or may not be hot. Now at 2 yrs 3 mo. it doesn't work. The light comes on, the non-cooking buttons work, but I can't get it to warm even after unplugging multiple times and even overnight.  Very disappointed with the short life!!!"
4,"This machine is awesome in every way, except one: durability.  We love this machine, the problem is I have needed to buy 3 in 10 years.  I gave it one more chance because at my large office complex, there is one on every floor and they have lasted 7 years now with much higher usage than a home microwave...and they are all still kicking."
5,"This is a great microwave. Internal size is perfect for a larger family, counter depth allows it to sit back into the counter top."
4,"It’s a nice large microwave oven. Even the pizza box fits in it. Only 2 cons. 1) door doesn’t open when the open button is pressed and appear to have a stickiness. So need both hands to open the door (which is not very practical when one is trying to load in some food). 2) there is no quick time starts. Even 30 second option needs to be selected then have to press start. No one click heating. Other than these two, haven’t had problems over the last couple of months of use."
2,"Well, after just over a year, it's suddenly started buzzing and smoking when I try to use it.  So, I now get to find another disposable appliance to waste my money on.  Good luck with the roulette game of finding something that'll last!"
4,It’s perfect for my small kitchen. Very easy to set up and use
1,Loved the sensor and the way it heated the whole food item at the same time. My old microwave had cold spots in the middle.  It worked great for 4 months.  It then started making a whistling noise while running and the outside top got so hot I couldn’t touch it.  Felt it was a potential fire hazard.  Returned it through Amazon for a credit card refund.  Much to my surprise I was charged a $43 restocking fee.  Hope they don’t just turn around and sell it to someone else!
4,I love the look and easy use of this microwave.  The only issue is it came with the clock piece jilted so it only shows half the clock.  Does bother me enough to send for a replacement.
4,Me agrado el tamaño y lo fácil de usarlo.
1,"Right, well, I was expecting to be happy with this purchase after reading all of the decent reviews, but I'm disappointed now that it's here. When I opened the box, I was greeted with the turntable ring being broken into pieces. Not that surprised it didn't make it, as it feels like cheap plastic. I was willing to overlook that though because a turntable ring isn't a big deal, but then I started taking everything off of the microwave itself and found another broken piece. Opened up the door to the microwave to see that the bottom piece of the safety interlock system had snapped off, so now I can't even shut the door all the way, which means I can't use the microwave at all now. It's just sitting there, a useless waste of money. Safe to say I'm quite ticked about this."
1,product was unable to turn on
4,"Very easy to use, with understandable controls (I hate to see microwaves with buttons that you have no idea what they do). Works well, and when the time stops it doesn't fill the whole house with loud beeping. Just be careful with cooking or reheating food: most food instructions are set for microwaves of 1100 watts or lower; this one is 1250 and can heat fast."
4,"First the positives.  It's almost exactly the same size as the microwave that went out, and slightly more powerful.  It cooks well, and the turntable runs smoothly.  The reason it didn't get 5 stars?  Because the control panel manages to make the simplest of operations take far longer than they should.  On my old microwave, if you wanted to record something at half power for five minutes, you hit minutes, followed by 5 and two zeros, and hit power followed by 5 and hit start.  You could do the time first or the power first, either way it worked fine.  For this one you have to hit the power button five times to get it down to half power,  If you hit it six times you have to keep hitting it till it rolls back again.  No way just to enter power level 5.  Then you enter the time.  If you switch the order, you figure out after you take the food out that it cooked it at full power instead of half power.  Of course the old oven displayed the cooking power you were using while it was running, of course this one doesn't. The old microwave I replaced worked for more than fifteen years, and the very forgiving and simple control panel functions it had are still very similar to the ones used on most microwaves.  Why make things that should be simple unnecessarily complicated and time consuming?  I bought this unit because it had very great reviews on quality.  Is it too much to ask that while making it last a long time, they not screw up something as simple as how you actually use the control pad to use the microwave?"
5,"Our 20-year old 1500 watt Panasonic (1.5 cubic ft) finally died; it was a great microwave.  I wanted something comparable, and this is it, only better.  After a couple of weeks, I have tried out all the major functions by now.The first (and easiest) was popcorn.  It was the best I have ever seen, using the 3.2 oz setting for the 3.6 oz Orville Redenbacher bag.  There were no burnt kernels, and very few unpopped ones.The cooking times are comparable to the old one, even though this one is lower power.  Maybe the old one was getting a little weak with age, or the new one is just more efficient.  But the ""inverter"" technology (which actually refers to the power supply) is very good at controlling the heat and making more effective use of the power available.  And the timing controls are the same as the old one, just with a few additional buttons for the new functions, so it is easy to use.My real favorite is the ""sensor"" technology.  If you do it right (choose the right setting for the type of food, and use a vented cover so that the steam can escape), it takes a lot of guesswork out of common chores.  I have tried both large and small baked potatoes (split in half with bacon on them), and they came out great; better than I could do with manual timings.  Also omelettes are perfect; I do egg burritos with salsa and sausage or whatever.  It allows experimentation with recipes without worrying about the cooking time or power.Vegetables are good too, though I use the ""reduce time"" button there to prevent them from being overcooked.I have a couple of minor gripes:  the push button to open the door is a little bit of over-design, and may push the microwave around.  Why not a handle on the door like the old one?  And as others have noted, the light is dim.  But I only use it to check boiling water once in a while, and with the sensor technology, I don't even need to do that much anymore.I just hope it lasts as long as the old one.  It is a winner for me."
3,I was happy enough with this product. The microwave has been kept clean.The turntable simply stopped.The Panasonic website says not to use if turntable is not turning. This item should last longer than a mere 16 months
5,"I got this Chefman MicroCrisp microwave oven because I was tired of ending up with soggy reheated food. The promise of a microwave that can also crisp and cook like an oven intrigued me, so I decided to give it a try.This microwave oven has a sleek all-black design with a sturdy stainless-steel handle, giving it a modern look that blends well with my kitchen appliances. The user-guided touch control panel is intuitive and makes it easy to select the desired cooking time and temperatures. After unboxing, I simply placed it on my countertop, plugged it in and started using it right away. The microwave's size is perfect, fitting seamlessly into my kitchen while still providing a spacious 1.1 cubic ft capacity. The instruction manual provided clear guidelines for the initial setup. It took no time to get the microwave ready for use.One of the awesome features of the Chefman MicroCrisp is its ""Cook & Crisp"" power combo. This unique function allows me to achieve oven-like results in a microwave! It works like a microwave air fryer combo, providing both heating and crisping capabilities in one appliance. With six precision presets, I no longer have to guess the cooking times for my favorite foods. Whether I want to cook, defrost, pop, reheat, or simply warm up my food, I can choose the appropriate preset and let the microwave do the rest. The results have been consistently satisfactory. Also, I like the alarm mute option, which allows me to silence the microwave's beeps. It comes in handy when I want to keep the noise level down, especially during late-night or early-morning cooking sessions to not wake up my family.While the Chefman MicroCrisp has impressed me overall, there are a few minor issues I encountered. Firstly, the interior could be better illuminated, as it can sometimes be challenging to see the food while it's cooking. Additionally, the power cord could be a bit longer for more flexible placement options.Overall, Chefman MicroCrisp microwave oven has exceeded my expectations. It delivers on its promise of providing crispy reheated food, making leftovers a delight to enjoy. The easy wipe-down stainless-steel interior and dishwasher-safe glass cooking plate ensure effortless cleanup. Overall, it's a versatile and convenient kitchen appliance.*** TL;DR ***I highly recommend the Chefman MicroCrisp Countertop Digital Microwave Oven. It combines the convenience of a microwave with the crispiness of an oven. The six precision presets and intuitive touch control panel make cooking hassle-free. While it has some minor issues, its overall performance and results are overly impressive.My rating is 5 stars!+++ Pros +++1) ""Cook & Crisp"" power combo for crispy reheated food.2) Intuitive touch control panel with precision presets.3) Alarm mute option for noise reduction.4) Perfectly sized and sleek all-black design.5) Spacious 1.1 cubic ft interior.6) Easy wipe-down stainless-steel interior.7) Dishwasher-safe glass cooking plate.--- Cons ---1) Interior illumination could be improved.2) Power cord could be longer for more flexibility."
3,"This unit only has rubber bumpers on the front legs, the back legs are just extruded metal.  This became a real problem when I discovered that all 4 legs are not level with each other.  Hence the unit wobbles 1/4 of an inch!  It naturally rested on the back 2 legs that did not have rubber bumpers on them, leaving only one front leg with a small rubber bumper touching the counter top.  Hence when I tried to open the door the microwave slide all over the place.  Because I did not want to hassle with a return, I did build a cradle for it, and then created a shim to level it out. After an hour of solving the leveling and sliding problem, I tried the microwave out.  Seems to work very well, and heats my coffee almost as fast as my last more powerful microwave.  Let's just hope that the only quality control issue is the lopsided uneven support legs."
5,This is a second one of these I have purchased for a second home.  We loved it so much we just got another one exactly like our first!  A really good buy too!
4,The power seems to be less with this unit although it's the same wattage as my previous GE unit.  Have to heat food a couple of minutes longer than I did previously.  Next time round I will purchase a unit with a handle on the door rather than a push button model.
5,Very happy with this purchase it’s compact sleek design with great power
4,"One of the reasons I bought this was for the BLUE LED DISPLAY that is mentioned in the item description three times. But it's not blue at all. It's a very dim faded green color.Hopefully I can get another one sent to me that has a BLUE LED DISPLAY.Other than that, the microwave is extremely light and moves around the counter when opening and closing the door. Do you will need some rubber sticky feet to go under it."
2,"Thought it was much bigger from the picture. I hate how small it is, and it doesn’t heat fast. Nice for a basement or a dorm. Just not what I expected, or wanted, so unhappy"
5,"I hesitated in buying a new microwave because I felt it would be a pain to relearn the new features, the button placements, blah, blah, blah. But the old unit was slowly failing and I needed to replace it before the Christmas holiday, and so I chose the ""Panasonic NN-SN936W Countertop Microwave with Inverter Technology, 2.2 Cubic Foot, 1250W, White"".I selected this unit based on features that were or became important to us: the button to open the door, inverter technology, a button for a 30 second quick cook, a signal when finished, a lighted oven when it cooks, when door is open a light comes on, sensors to cook, reheat, and defrost.  And we chose the lighter color which helps brighten up a dark corner.  We are happy with it."
5,"Looks great, works very well and matches our GE appliances.  For the first 6-8 months I noticed the keypad numbers bubbling up so I called Faberware.  There was a thin plastic protective cover over the keypad I didn't see.  I took it off and it looks great!  Would recommend this microwave."
5,Just what I wanted!👍
5,This is such a great microwave that we bought a second one for our rental house. Directions are pretty straightforward once you understand how the air fryer works. Looks nice on the shelf.
5,I love this thing!!  It grills beautifully. The air fry is just what a couple of seniors need for a bit of fried food without a lot of grease. It heats quickly.
1,"Please read the reviews. This is a BAD Quality Microwave box! DO NOT BUY!  Problem #1:  Wobbly box. I had to put a piece of cupboard on one leg to keep the  box stable on the counter.  Problem #2: Horrible, I mean absolutely HORRIBLE touch control panel.  You have it press HARD and maybe 3-4 times before it registers.  I mean BAD!!!  Problem #3:  NOISY!  Simply closing the door is too load!!  Problem #4:  Complex instruction just to get a different power level.  RETURNING THIS PRODUCT!!"
3,"I use the convection and microwave features all the time. But now it won’t convection heat above 360, when it used to go to 425. Also it frequently loses Alexa connection and is not user friendly to reconnect. It has lost its ability to follow Alexa voice commands. Beeps stopped working on the keypad. Size is comparable to other similar ovens. It’s no longer for sale and I guess that’s why."
3,Works fine just it makes a lot of noise
4,"I like the function of the microwave, but the user panels letters and numeral are not bold enough and are not backlit, making it some what difficult to use. I received it 2 days late, because it was delivered to a neighbors house half mile away. Neighbor called and asked if i was missing something. Said this microwave was in his garage with my name and address on it. Good neighbor delivered it to me. USPS can not be trusted."
2,Very Very Very Large
1,"I bought this in July, it no longer works"
1,"Single person light usage with meticulous cleaning with no chemicals…..this is what happened after a year and a half.  Black n Decker support frustrating having me send repeated multiple documentation to then tell me it is out of warranty.  They sometimes make exceptions, they said, but not in this case.So far, extended warranty won’t cover it either.Update:  Asurion warranty stepped up..yay.  Still disappointed with BlackNDecker and will NOT buy again."
5,"To be clear, I just use the microwave to warm things up. I also use it to steam veggies in a steamer dish specifically made for microwaves. Otherwise, I do not use microwaves to cook things. I cook by more conventional means (I.e. oven, stove, crockpot , etc). With that said, it does a great job. It’s also easy to clean when my sons occasionally explode their food in there."
4,"Good price. Looks nice. Somewhat low quality construction.Microwave being replaced had the same power output specifications, this new microwave takes about twice as long to heat anything. Overall satisfied. Giving a solid B rating"
2,"I returned the oven because of uneven heating. Other remarks...The oven is quiet (compared to my very old microwave oven.)The buttons are difficult to read. . . a flashlight helps.I'd like to be able to kill the beeper. The best solution I've come up with is to open the door just before time's up. But, that means you have to be at the oven when time is about to run out. ""Cancelling"" after you open the door will clear the remaining second(s) but will cause a single beep."
5,"It's what it says it is. Looks nice on the counter - I mean for being what it is. I didn't need to read the manual to set the time, figure out the timer - so points for intuitive design. It microwaves stuff as expected - I'm happy with the purchase."
2,"The things that don't matter much are fine: it looks nice, the touch-pad seems sturdy, the defrost works fine. The thing that matters most, though, how it heats food, is lousy! I bought this to replace an older, 1000 W, no-name brand that was starting to cook unevenly. This 1100W oven takes twice as long to heat my food as my old one! I spent good money for this, thinking the name brand would insure a quality product, but I was sadly mistaken. Now, I have to live with it."
1,"I never usually write reviews but I do read them to determine whether or not I should buy anything.  I bought this microwave almost exactly 2 years ago it has a""life expectancy "" of 5-7 years....and I loved it.  But I was warming something up for my daughter today and after 15 seconds the metal plate caught on fire and was smoking and sparking.  I keep my microwave very clean always its a huge pet peeve of mine so I'm not sure if it's something wrong with their microwaves in general or just a default with this specific microwave during the manufacturing process. Either way it almost cost me my home (it was that bad although the picture looks minor the amount of smoke and sparks were pretty scary) I really just want to put it out there so people know it's a possibility."
2,"I bought this last May and exactly 2 months past the ""limited"" warranty I was cleaning and saw all the paint was peeling off and rusting. Its disgusting? I have never had a microwave do this. I am so disappointed, not in position to buy another right now."
1,"This microwave seemed like a great improvement from our old one which would keep tuning even after the timer stopped. At least the old one stopped heating at that point. We have had this microwave for 3 months and this is the second time it didn't stop after the timer ended. The first time we were in the kitchen and we're able to catch it.  This time, distracted by things (as people often are) the microwave did not stop heating. When we finally could smell the burning, the microwave was full of smoke and almost started a FIRE!!Of course we are outside the return window, so pretty sure we are just out $125!"
1,While heating up our food in the microwave safe container the side of the microwave caught fire after making a crackle sound and sparked.
5,Perfect for my daughter's dorm room.  Matches well with her stainless mini-fridge and stainless coffee maker.  She likes her stylish mini-kitchen nook in her room.
3,"Works like it is supposed to, but one big drawback is there is no quick start (numbers 1-6).  This means that you cannot select 2 and it auto starts.  So if you hit 2 and then start, it runs for 2 seconds.  Even on the 30 second option you have to then hit start.  It does however let you select the 30 second button multiple times as well as adding 30 seconds (once or multi) after starting the cycle."
1,"Brand new just received, door won’t open push button wasn't engaging with the plastic fitting to push on the door latch.  Improper installationOf plastic fitting. Wasn't snapped in place.  I found this out after removing cover from microwave. After numerous tries, I was able tO snap the plastic lever back into its correct position. Door button works fine now. It was a hassle,but now I'm not waiting for another microwave!Probably would not buy another Black and Decker."
3,"This is a good microwave, with a poor user interface.  Having black ""buttons"" (for the controls) against a black background was a foolish mistake.  The face of the microwave requires good (exterior) illumination for easy use."
1,"Bought this microwave late October and worked perfectly fine, but now the microwave is making a weird loud noise. Total waste of money."
5,So far this has been a great little microwave. I have the classic model and no complaints.. To me it's not extremely loud and it's a sound you get accustom to. Yes you know it's on which is what I prefer.
2,This thing seems like it’s missing parts. The door seems loose and it’s loud when in use. Poor quality but cute I guess. Don’t recommend
3,Had many microwaves over the years none of them leaked enough to kill the wifi in the house. This is a huge problem as we work from home.  How can they get away with this much leaking? Yes my cell phone rings in the microwave.
1,We used it about five times and it broke. I need to bring it someplace to get it fixed. I keep getting a message that something is wrong with the door.
3,"My microwave bit the dust and I couldn’t find specs on it to duplicate the size and strength. I ordered based off reviews and intentionally choose one that was mid-range in size, strength, and price thinking it would be enough.I cannot fit my dinner plates in this properly. The go in, but the get jammed and won’t turn. This is absolutely not the microwave for you if you’re needing something that can handle more than bowls or beverages. Big disappointment."
2,Hard to open
5,"We were pleased to be able to get the same Panasonic microwave we chose when we remodeled our kitchen since it's a perfect fit for the microwave garage.  Our only issue with this model is that it seems to have a tendency to trip the arc fault part of the circuit breakers that are current code for kitchens and so on.  The older one did that too, but not as bad as an even older one we had for a while.  We decided that since the microwave is the ONLY thing on a dedicated 20A circuit with a dedicated ground fault outlet, it was OK for our needs to eliminate the arc fault breaker and replace it with a standard (overcurrent) breaker.  We'll take our chances on an arc fault destroying the microwave (very unlikely) or killing us (also very unlikely)."
2,"After about six months the high-voltage unit(s) died. It was under warranty, but that still meant two plus hours of driving to and from the repair station (only one still open within 300 miles) and waiting weeks for the repair to be completed. Now it works again and we're pleased."
3,"This was.purchased in September, by March it was bubbling amd peeling on the keypad. I live alone and take good care of it, but I am deeply disappointed in the eyesore it is now."
1,This microwave died far sooner. I would think the life expectancy of a microwave should be more than 2 years -- but this one died at 2 years. Very disappointing.
1,..... of course warranty expired a few months ago.  Next step--add more refuse to the landfill.
4,LIKE THE EASY USE AND LIGHT WEIGHT
3,The turntable didn't work the first month of use then for whatever reason it finally started to work - wonder if it'll fail the same way? It's a powerhorse so I am having to readjust ALL my usual cooking times and heating levels. It's HUGE so be prepared - I would NOT advertise this monster as a countertop microwave.
3,"Pros: Good power, fits into the space I have. Cons:  1) The glass plate has notches that fit into corresponding notches on the bottom of the unit, but the fit is not tight enough. The plate easily becomes unstable with heavier foods on top of it. 2) The beeper sounds 5 times, even if I've opened the door and taken out the food. 3) The light stays on until I close the door. If I leave the door ajar, the light stays on until I close the door. 4) The smaller interior cavity means that fewer items can fit into the space. My past microwave fit into the same small space I have, but it had a larger cavity."
5,"Good quality microwave. After looking in person and online at lots of microwaves this one stood out as reasonably priced, good size, and useful features. The genuis sensor and inverter technology definitely cook, heat, and defrost evenly and well."
3,"Every thing was good, except for when I take something out, if I'm not really careful, (which who is All of the time) the prongs on the door have sharp edges that  cut the wrist bad enough to bleed.  I'll have to file them down a bit, which the customers shouldn't have to do."
2,"I like this microwave, but for its rating, it just doesn't get the job done as quickly as I would expect.  Everything else is perfect.  It just ""feels more like 800 watts than 1000"".  The features available for rating don't include power which I find strangely coincidental.  Is it possible that Faberware knows that they messed up on the engineering of this unit?  I like Faberware products, recently bought a set of stainless steel pots and pans.  I like this microwave also, but I feel that the power generated is to be desired."
3,"The unit itself seems fine, meets our needs and as described.  However Amazon really need to look at the warehouse where this was stored as there was a hole in the box and when opened, it was littered with mice feces and the styrofoam was chewed up, thus the 3 stars.  Pretty disgusting actually, if my son at college had not thrown out the packaging I would have had it sent back."
5,Works very good. Easy to clean.
3,Uneven temp.
2,Do not like anything about it!
5,"This is a perfect little microwave for our apartment. It's the right size, works well and has plenty of pre-programmed times that work very well for the ones I've tried. If you are looking for a small, good microwave, this is it. If you want a full size one, this is NOT the one because it just barely fits a 8.5"" plate in it. The cooking times need to be adjusted up for normal stuff because it's not a hugely powerful microwave, but the pre-programmed buttons seem to take that into account.It works well and looks great with our other appliances in our kitchen and fits perfectly on the counter under the shelf next to the fridge."
5,"Best Microwave from all the ones I previously owned, I highly  recommend"
4,"It has taken us some time to sort out the various features. All mistakes are ours, but we LOVE the possibility of reheating 7 lb.smoked ham for family group, and cooking large casseroles for family dinner, nothing burns. I even reheated some rolls the other night, didn't need to add bowl of water as in old unit. I warmed mixed breast/thighs previously grilled, brushed lightly with sauce for 3-min cook on, all well."
1,"The second one I'm returning and with the same problem. I believe Amazon was supplied a faulty batch of this model of Toshiba microwaves. The microwave TRAY KEEPS TURNING for 5-8 seconds after the time runs out. The manufacturer, whom I contacted, stated that this was not normal. I exchanged it but noted the same problem with the new one. I'll be returning this one also and looking for a new make."
2,"Really liked the microwave. We used it to heat leftovers, cook frozen foods, heat drinks and thaw frozen meat. Love the inverter technology. However the unit only lasted  from March 2019 to December 2021. This is why it gets only two stars and that is probably generous as I have had microwaves that have lasted more than 20 in the past. Fortunately I had an extended warranty and they say that they will send me an Amazon credit for the purchase price of the unit."
2,"This is probably 1 of the worst microwaves I've ever had.  It makes rattly sounds when in use no matter what's in it.  You have to make sure you press the start button with the flattest part of your finger or it won't work.  The buttons seem to, even after only a couple weeks' use, develop little pin-like holes from use.  Takes several tries to get it even going."
5,"Perfect small size for me, love the ability to turn off the annoying beeping that most microwaves have."
4,"I really like this microwave, but I live in an older house with older wiring so I have to be extra careful not to flip a breaker using the crisp setting because while the microwave is 1000 watts, the crisp side is 1800 watts and surges up quickly. Be sure to check the rating on your fuse that the plug you're using is on and move to a higher rated plug if needed. This microwave is smaller than the one it's replacing but the inside area is still the same size. I like the way it only shows the start button and the time until I open the door or touch the start button. It's a very powerful machine. I rated it 4 stars because it's so high of a wattage  for the crisp tho."
1,"Not recommended, I bought this microwave because it looks like it fits with my furniture, but I've had it for a month and it still smells like burning wires, I was terrified, thankfully Amazon let me return it although I have already passed the return date from the manufacturer by one month."
4,Louder than last one from this company. Does it’s job.
5,"My 15 year old microwave had finally begun to rust inside and was losing power. It took 4 minutes to boil a mug of water for a cup of tea. I researched and really wanted a big, high powered microwave, I chose this one and boy, am I ever impressed! This one boils a mug of water in 1 minute and 40 seconds, that's pretty darn good. The ease of use is incredibly good, it has numerous multi function buttons, a good solid closing door and a clear but not obnoxious timer alarm when finished.  I searched all over, found this same model at Walmart but Amazon beat everyone's price, plus for a little piece of mind I bought the extended Asurion Protection plan (48 months) from Amazon as well. If your looking for a big sized microwave with max power then this is the one for you. I will update this review in 6 months. My rating is 10 stars, yes, really that good!"
2,"It didn't cook food all the way through and sometimes the food would be lukewarm, even though I set it on high and cooked it per the package directions.  Worried that I'd get sick from inadequately cooked food.  Tried cooking it longer than directions but still wouldn't always cook through.  Way past the 30 day replacement date so will toss in the garbage and spend another $100 plus dollars for a new one.  Definitely not this brand ever again!"
1,Purchased on 1/30/23 and it stopped working after a month of extremely light use. Troubleshooting has been done. The product isn't receiving power; many power outlets have been attempted. I'm pretty disappointed given this product was purchased new and quit working right after the 30-day return period.
1,I bought this microwave for my granddaughter when she moved into her first apartment. That was in February of this year and the microwave has already stopped working. She says some of the buttons work but some don’t. Doesn’t last very long.
1,"The microwave seemed fine and perfect for what we wanted. We have an old house from 1967 that was remodeled, but still had no space for an over-the-oven microwave. The size was not too big and not too small. It was easy to use, but after a month, the turntable stopped working. It began to stop turning in the middle of heating something. Then, it would start up again abruptly. This would cause the glass tray and whatever food was on it to jump and jerk around. Since we got this only a month ago, I sent an email in to the company today. We will see what their response is.UPDATEYou will never believe this. The company, after I gave them a copy of the proof that I purchased this product, told me they would send me another one...AFTER I send them a picture proving I had cut the cord from the defective unit! I have never heard of something so ridiculous in all my life! I told them that I don't believe it to be good customer service or good business practice to tell me that, on top of dealing with a defective microwave, I would have to pay to take it to the dump. I also told them that they were making the insulting assumption that I am attempting to cheat them out of a microwave. I realize there is no way to PROVE that my microwave is malfunctioning, but I told them I expected to ship it back to them (AFTER receiving the new one and at no expense to myself seeing as how it is their product that is defective and it is still very much under warranty) so that I would not be without the use of a microwave and not have to pay extra to take it to the dump. They have not since responded to my email! I contacted Amazon, even though it was after the 30 day return window, and they were gracious enough to work with me. I was also told that Farberware is no longer in business. The use of the name of their company was sold to different companies for different products. So a totally different company makes their blenders than makes their microwaves etc. I will update again if they ever respond."
1,"Definately a quality control and defect issue.  Tried to clear control panel including un-plugging and on both units, the stuck status LED control panel stayed the same.  After problems with two units, returned and bought a Cusinart.  The Cusinart is perfect and actaully better looking, easier to use and has a smart look.  Sorry GE."
4,I liked the product but it did not fit into the area where we wanted to use it.
5,Love everything about it
1,"The media could not be loaded.I had the RCA Microwave installed over my range and we discovered that it would not work. The lights, fan, and clock work  but when I try to cook food in the microwave it just says “pause” and will not start. I called the RCA helpline on October 4 and they assigned me a case file number. They asked me to send them a copy of my purchase order, a picture of the front of the microwave, and the model and serial number. I submitted the requested information on October 5. Since then I have called them several times and resubmitted the requested material again. Each time, they tell me that someone will get in touch with me as soon as possible. As of November 3, after almost a month since I first contacted them, no one from RCA/Curtis has gotten in touch with me about the microwave oven. Since I paid to have it installed, I really want a repair person to look at it before I have it uninstalled, in case it is a repairable problem. Unfortunately it looks like no one from RCA/Curtis is going to get back to me. I seriously regret  buying this microwave.Update 12/27/2017– I have been trying to get Curtis International (who owns RCA) to honor the warranty on this microwave since October 5,2017. This microwave has NEVER worked. Today I got an email from Curtis telling me how to box up the microwave and how to mail it back to them via USPS and when they get it they will determine if they will replace/repair it. Of course I have to return it at my own expense. I have asked them for a pre-paid shipping label but so far no response on that request. Typically it takes them 2-3 weeks to respond to any email and you cannot contact the warranty people by phone. I have supplied the bill of sale, model number, pictures of the microwave at least four times to them and they always have some excuse for why they are delaying in honoring the warranty. I bought this microwave because there were some glowing reviews but buyer beware! If you get a POS like I did, good luck trying to get them to honor their warranty. I should have returned the microwave to Amazon as soon as we discovered that the cook options will not work but since the fan and lights worked, I hoped it was something simple to repair. And I had already paid someone to install it. I thought that RCA was a trusted name so there shouldn’t be a problem getting a repair/replacement. Was I wrong!!!ANOTHER UPDATE:  Since Curtis/RCA wants me to pay for shipping their defective microwave back to them and I am waiting to see if they will send me a pre-paid shipping label (yeah, right), I decided to see if a local microwave repair person could work on this microwave.  So far, I have contacted 3 different repair service companies and NONE of them will work on Curtis/RCA microwaves.  WOW!FINAL UPDATE . Jan 10, 2018.  I refused to pay to ship the defective RCA Microwave to Curtis/RCA.  I could not understand why a company would sell defective merchandise and then expect the customer to pay to have the defective microwave shipped to them.  Shipping a heavy microwave to Detroit, MI was going to be expensive!  I finally found a microwave repairman who said he would try to repair he microwave.  When he arrived, he agreed that it was a defective control panel and would have to be replaced.  Now here is the kicker:  This microwave is proprietary--which means repair companies cannot purchase parts for it.  The only way you can get service is to ship it back to Curtis/RCA at customers' expense and HOPE that Curtis/RCA will repair it and send it back.  Apparently, Curtis/RCA has been selling defective microwaves over the past several months, based on reviews I have read.  DO NOT buy this microwave!!"
5,Good size
2,"I bought this for the look and size as we needed a microwave that fit a specific area. At first glance this has a lot of positive features - the top one being how incredibly quiet it is. Sometimes we even forget we are microwaving something as we simply don't hear anything.However, two failed features on this caused us to return it. The first one is it's inability to microwave popcorn on the popcorn setting. This is something my kids use all the time. It only heats for 30 seconds and then shuts off. The other heating challenge was how it cooks bacon. We use it at least once a week to cook bacon for our family weekend breakfast. It takes nearly 10 minutes to cook 5 slices of bacon. That is double what our previous microwave took.If it cooked in a more timely manner and the popcorn button worked - it would be a keeper. Sadly, that is not the case. We just returned it and are now in search of a new one."
2,"This thing leaks electromagnetic waves around 2.4ghz so itll kill your wifi while in use. It's fine otherwise, though.Use 5ghz wifi to avoid this."
4,"We like most things about the microwave, especially that we can put a 9 X 13 dish in it.  So far my primary complaint is that it's rather noisy."
3,"I love the red color and the ease of operation - HOWEVER --- I am REALLY tired of almost always having some defect in nearly every applicance these days!  Thank you for allowing china to cheapen US product consumption.  The microwave CLOCK IS DEFECTIVE.  I CAN RE-SET IT EVERY COUPLE OF HOURS AND IT MOVES AHEAD HOURS.  I HAVE JUST MOVED INTO A NEW HOME AND IF I DIDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TO DO, AND IF MY FRIEND HADN'T DESTROYED THE BOX IT CAME IN, I WOULD HAVE RETURNED FOR REPLACEMENT.  I AM JUST TIRED OF RETURNS FOR DEFECTS!!!  Also, beware when another applicance issuggested"" I went ahead and also ordered a toaster that was supposed to match color wise but DOES NOT."
3,"The microwave itself started making an odd noise after we had it for about 7 months. I messed with the plate on the inside, taking it out to see if it was off center or causing the noise but it was not that. I called the warranty company. They asked me to send them some additional information, the receipt, serial number, and a recording of the noise. I sent it to them, received a confirmation email that they were working on it, but I did not hear back from them for a little while.  I sent an email noting that I had not heard back and the next day, I received a check in the mail for a refund."
1,"At first I liked this microwave.  It's small, runs quietly and works well.  But in almost exactly 4 months it suddenly overheated when trying to bake 2 medium size potatoes.  The control panel buttons did not work.  the inside light wouldn't shut off and the potatoes were rubbery and petrified.  After we took the potatoes out the oven got hotter and hotter even though it didn't appear to be still on.  I tried two more potatoes but the control panel didn't work again and the over over heated without ever really coming on.  We had to unplug it because it just kept getting hotter and hotter. We tried to contact Farberware for a manufacturer's warranty as it ws past the Amazon warranty.  None of Farberware's phone numbers or emails work.  Some are disconnected, others don't reach a human.  On the website it says they have so many returns expect it to be 8-10 weeks before hearing from Farberware.  Obviously we lost our money on this product."
5,"Bought this to replace almost identical Panasonic that failed to operate after 5-6 years.  The great thing about Panasonic inverter style microwaves is that they don't regulate the power lever by cycling the unit off and on from full power to no power every couple of seconds (called duty cycle controlling) which can lead to very uneven cooking and overcooking edges.  They actually proportionately throttle down the power at lower and lower settings while maintaining the power level constant at whatever level you choose.  Interface is excellent although I never use anything but timer and power level most of the time.  Internal light comes on when you open door, and stays on while you're cooking.  Tucked unit away in the kitchen dual door pantry at eye level, ran the cord through a drilled hole, out the side to an outlet hidden behind the refrigerator. Unfortunately if the refrig, side by side freezer, and the microwave at 8 setting or higher all run together, the basement breaker trips, but only every few months on average.  Beats leaving it out on the counter.  You just leave the pantry doors open of course when you're cooking.  Something to remember:  You need to avoid closing the door of the microwave when you have steam condensation left inside.  The paint will eventually chip and rust will occur in places over the years.  On this one we always wipe off inside the box, inside door, and on bottom of box beneath rotating glass plate when done cooking anything that creates steam.  I guess at this price you shouldn't expect stainless interior."
4,thank you for product. Okay
1,"This product failed to work, displays error H98."
4,Nice for small areas. Works just fine
3,The machine was a pretty color but the heating has not been favorable.. lots of extra times added time. The black on the face of it in the corner is lifting off the machine.
4,We had to have a small one and this one is working great.
3,"Picked one of these up after my less than a year old Kenmore decided to die with the rest of Sears.  Was an Amazon Choice product, and the price was cheap, so i snagged it, and curbed the other one. In the six months i've had it, i can honestly say.It's decent enough.Not great, it's only 900 watts, so you'll have to adjust cook times since basically everything is designed for 1200wkeypads and timer work fine, but  so far the plastic on the control buttons has started to de laminate very quickly.  It's not the plastic that everything ships with, it's literally the keypad separating layers.  The LED lighting went all wonky and stopped working a month or two ago.The turntable is neat, but really likes to pop off the spinner and jam up at random intervals,If you need a microwave for your dorm room or a rec room, this is fine. It gets the job done with minor hassles, little complaints here and there. But if you're using this regularly with a group of people, it shows it's wear remarkably quickly. It still works fine, mind you, but there are better options available."
1,We set up this microwave on October first 2018. It died on February third 2019. Don’t waste your money
1,"The microwave was very late, there was no seller to contact and it isn't easy to use.  You can't put in the amount of time you want!"
5,"It works great, and it’s what I ordered"
1,"settings do not work, can not set time or any of the cooking/heating settings"
1,"Pretty sad this didn't work, the reviews were so good. We are looking for a compact microwave (replacing a Kenmore that we've had forever!) but the opening won't accommodate either of our dinner plates. Funny, I even read a review on the Black & Decker website stating that it was not the quoted 0.7 cubic feet but I did read that the glass turntable was 10"", which is what our old one was, so I took a chance. I didn't measure the inside as the walls aren't perfectly flat, but I can tell you that our 10 7/8 dinner plate would not fit into the interior unless we tilted it - which doesn't seem like a great idea w/ a plate full of food. For $75 I don't want an oven that I'm frustrated with."
3,"Overall, it's a nice, compact microwave. My main complaint is the clock does not work. I now note others have experienced the same problem, only to be told to return the microwave. I'm not going thru that hassle. I should have more diligently researched this model before purchase. Just beware, there appears to be an ongoing clock problem."
5,This 3 in 1 does some cool stuff. It's large and fits alot. I wish it came with a bigger air fry basket like some competitors have though. A word of warning...it gets hot enough to melt butter on the cabinet so buyers should keep that in mind.
1,"Farberware doesn’t make this. They refer you to Edge Consumer Brands. The number Farberware gives you got me to an obnoxious sales thing for medic alerts. What? I double checked all numbers. Looked up Edge. No website. BBB rating is “F”. Really! I contacted Amazon again. The Amazon rep couldn’t get hold of a human at Farberware. I realized that if I had problems later, I’d never get help, so decided to return the microwave. It was actually so ridiculous I laughed. Farberware should reconsider trying to farm out appliances and putting their name on it. Stick to what they do well. I’ve since seen reviews of other Farberware appliances that said same thing. No luck with Edge. No more Farberware appliances for me! Good cookware, but I won’t buy anything else from them."
3,Microwave is so loud
5,"I use this microwave just about daily.Works great, takes up little space, very happy with it"
3,"I think this would be a nice micro wave-air fryer if they would give some instructions on how to use it. I looks nice but there are virtually no instructions that tell you how to use the different function that they say this unit has. My wife is a retired engineer and can't figure out what the different heat settings are, or how long different things should take to cook in any of the different settings in any of them the air fryer, the microwave, or convection oven."
4,I like that the microwave heats food evenly.  No more cold in the middle...nuke it some more.  The only thing that gave me a fit wes the depth.  The given measurements should have fit nicely in my cabinet.  The only problem was the power cord in the back adds an additional 2 1/2 inches.  The front legs stuck out 2 inches past the front of my cabinet shelf.  I have to put something under the microwave so that it sits level.Add 3 inches to the depth to ensure a good fit.
2,We noticed it holding a lot of excess moisture even though it was well ventilated. Today I noticed rust at the inside back seam and it’s not even a year old yet. Tried to go to their website to submit a ticket and you can’t for microwaves and their customer service number isn’t even for Farberware and doesn’t connect to a live person. Not sure if I got a bum microwave or if this is how their products are. Tried to show a picture but it wouldn’t allow me to attach.
1,"Nothing special as far as microwaves go to justify $50 more expensive. I thought maybe it would last longer, as Toshiba had a good reputation. I bought it July 26 2022, and 5 1/2 months later I was cooking rice in it at 50% power. Suddenly I heard a click and all the power in the house blinked. I reset the microwave and waited the 20 minutes to cook. After that time, the rice was still cold. I reset everything but still nothing - no heat. It makes noise, turntable and timer work - just no heat. I expect a replacement, but if not will be very upset."
1,The media could not be loaded.I've had this microwave for six months and now there are sparks flying from the side on the inside.  Yesterday it was my favorite kitchen appliance. Today it's a piece of junk and a fire hazard.
4,Combo microwave & air fryer that fits nicely on the counter for $256?! One major design flaw however: the front plate does not light up! Having a small light handy is a small inconvenience for this unit!
4,It is worth the money very good buy
3,Gross plastic smell when you heat food. Very unappetizing and probably toxic.
1,"Had to return did not work when we plugged it in. Very disappointed because I like the looks of it, probably will never order one on line again."
1,"Like the depth and size of this microwave.  I""ve owned microwaves, but never one that failed.  This one was lightly used and actually cracked inside along the back.  I should have replaced it then.  After less than 2 years it stopped working."
1,"We have had this for about a year.  Everything it is used, you will notice there is water drops along the top and water on the door.  This causes the inside to quickly deteriorate, paint to peel, etc."
2,"Arrived fast, thank you!! Nice looking, easy to use and fits nicely. Heats fast, easy to read. Packaged great. I'm happy it arrived so fast as my other one (4 yrs. old) I found had broken/rusted and I'd been using it. I threw it out and came here immediately to get a new one and different brand. So far, perfect! Easy to clean also. No noise I notice at all. It seems well built so I guess it's about a normal weight as I don't have anything to compare it to.-->>UPDATE - See photo added Oct. 27, 2020 /// Light inside began to blink fast when I tried to use it. I put a flashlight on it so you can see / view that plate thingy inside which is all broken like.  I have no idea what happened or when nor do I know what it is or what is wrong with it but I will NOT be using this anymore. I think it should have lasted much longer as it's not used a lot. The light bulb is very hard to find and not reachable from inside this unit. I'M NOT USING IT AGAIN. I'll add more pics. Not safe imo."
5,"I bought mine 12/21, and just pulled it out of storage to replace a very old microwave that I finally decided I let limp along for the past year. It's extremely quiet! It cooked 2 potatoes in 7 minutes, then u put them in the air fryer to crisp up the jackets. I also reheated my leftovers (chicken thighs, corn cob and half a potato) in a minute and a half! I think I'm going to be very happy with this microwave. I just hope the inside track where the wheels rotate doesn't  wear out like my old microwave (not faberware), but that was the issue to finally throw out the old one... I don't know how old that microwave actually was. I used it for over 7 years and it was given to me used. I don't know why people think this brand is loud, I find it extremely quiet compared to the one I just threw out :)  And, the glass turntable is very large, too. Love it!"
1,Order twice.  First time the glass door came broken.  The second one was dented on the back inside and also had no power to it when plugged in.  Didn't try a thrid time.
4,"Works!  It's a little noisy, especially when starting to cook. The timer ""times"" out quickly if you don't push START quickly.So far, no real complaints."
4,"Love it so far! Well made, looks great. The timer notification chime is a nice change from all of the other machines we’ve had in the past. Would recommend."
4,"We liked this microwave and our family of 8 used it every day many times a day for 5 years. Then today it started to spark and the interior liner had a brown melted spot. Tried it one last time, and it sparked again. So it’s fried. They just don’t last as long anymore"
4,Product was nice. Perfect small/compact spaceYet item is damaged.
3,Works fine but continues to emit an unpleasant metallic odor.
4,"First of all, this Farberware microwave oven is Farberware only in name/branding, which Farberware licenses for the purpose to Englewood Marketing, which gets the ovens made mostly in China, and then markets, sells, and warrantees them. It’s not really up to Farberware traditional standards, but still probably among the best in a large, really crummy field of available microwaves.This oven comes in 4 or 5 different “colors;” mine is “stainless steel,” and calling that the “color” is pretty accurate, as there’s a thin veneer of what probably is really stainless on/around the front face of the oven, and that’s it, that’s about all the stainless on or in this oven, ‘most everything else is plastic and cheap, painted steel. The very first bullet point of the product description falsely says, “Stainless Steel exterior and Stainless Steel interior,” but that’s just a big, bad lie. (It’s generally easy to tell, as a magnet isn’t attracted to stainless - and stainless is almost never painted or coated, ‘cause it’s fine without.) Nonetheless, from the front, it actually looks good, handsome. From the top and sides it looks like what it is, plastic and cheap painted steel. But still it’s probably about as good or better as any other at the price.(There is another available color, “copper,” which is also handsome, but, ironically, reminds me very much of Revere Ware cooking pots, Farberware’s long-time traditional rival.)This oven consumes 1500 watts electrical power, by actual measure, same as advertised. I haven’t yet bothered to measure/test the microwave radiative power delivered into the cooking chamber, to see if it matches the advertised 1000 watts. (The difference, the missing 500 watts, is lost in the process of converting from electrical power to microwave.)This oven, so far for us, cooks well and evenly enough. There are a lot of reviewers here reporting various hard, early failures with this oven, but so far at least we’ve been lucky, ours works. Time will tell.Reduced power levels, e.g. 50%, as/when requested by the user, are achieved, not by actually running at 50% power, but by cycling between full on and off at somewhere around 10 second intervals with a 50% (or whatever) duty cycle. (Do all microwave ovens work this way, is it too hard to really “dim” the microwave generator?) I suppose this is mostly okay, but if you want say 50% power for a short period like 10 seconds, perhaps to soften a small amount of butter, you’re quite out of luck.The power cord is 3 feet long - rather short, too short for our situation, we’re forced to get and use an extension cord. Our previous microwave cord was 4-1/2 feet, which worked perfectly by itself.The oven’s operational noise is a bit loud, certainly a bit louder than our previous microwave.The oven’s audio beep signaling sound is produced on way too many occasions; and way too many beeps for less than no possible purpose - like it’s beeping to notify you at the end of a cooking cycle - which is pretty ridiculous in the first place, as the oven is noisy enough in operation that you’d have to be deaf not to hear it stop - and you’ve opened the door and it obviously knows that too but still continues to beep regardless; and it (the beeping, still) is too loud; and is especially sorely lacking a way to just turn the whole darn beeper off (i.e. *OFF*). A super nasty, irritating fault in my view, believing firmly that machines should be seen but not heard. Especially egregious since the makers of this oven invested so much in hardware and firmware for cheesy gimmicks like dedicated Pizza and dog-food buttons, but couldn’t be bothered to simply add a small bit of firmware to allow the owner/user of the oven to tell it to just be quiet, do not beep at me!Occasionally this oven requires two or more presses of a button before it registers. This is probably just some flakiness in the (always cheap) membrane button switches, but might also be a bug in the firmware, I haven’t lived with this oven for long enough to know which yet.The oven interior light is needlessly ridiculously dim; and the oven interior surface is needlessly dark, medium-dark grey (could as easily and better been lighter-colored); and visibility through its front-door window is very poor (heavily obscured by some kind of presumably protective masking, but also needlessly dark); so overall visibility of whatever’s inside is triply-needlessly extremely poor. My mate sarcastically called it “theatrical.” I call it nearly useless, almost impossible to see into. They could just as easily install a light bulb with 10 times the light output.The Instruction Manual is written in rather broken english, presumably by a Chinese, sometimes understandable, but often not. Fortunately the oven is not so complicated that you can’t generally bumble around and figure it out.Customer service - by Englewood Marketing, in Green Bay, WI USA - is remarkably quick, nice, knowledgeable and helpful, at least for answering operational questions. Didn’t try ‘em on any more substantial matters.The real, actual weight of this oven, including the turntable, excluding all the packaging, is 29lbs, 14ozs., i.e. 2oz’s. under 30lbs. The Instruction Manual says the “Net Weight” is “Approx 31.0Lbs” - but I’m pretty certain that’s just not currently accurate, over by a pound. Given that they specified the ostensible weight down to the tenth of a pound, I’d guess that their scale is accurate but that they have lightened/cheapened the oven by “approx.” a pound since they earlier put it into production and weighed it. And this oven’s weight is perhaps a little bit light in the field of similarly priced ovens. This might be somewhat the cause of the weight of this particular oven being so rarely noted - and so all over the map, anywhere from 24 to 36lbs., when it is mentioned.The warranty on this oven is nominally for 1 year - but, like pretty much all current microwave warranties, effectively worthless by the time you get done navigating its terms and conditions. In almost any case of a problem, you’d be better off just biting the bullet and getting another oven.So why, out of the hundreds of microwave ovens available, did we get this one? Because it appears to me that they are all pretty crummy, badly flawed, a number of them even severe fire hazards; of those that will fit our strictly constrained space, this Farberware seemed and still seems to be the most-capable/least-awful, at pretty much any price.If I were rating on an absolute scale, considering this Farberware oven’s many faults, I would give it only 3 stars. But, considering the large field of its mediocre competitors, grading somewhat on a curve, I’ll give it 4 stars for now."
5,Despite the price this is a big microwave. I think some were expecting this to be a compact microwave but at 1000 watts they don't come much smaller than this. I love that if you leave something it the microwave lets out reminder beeps to tell you. This is a godsend with a husband who loves to heat up coffee but forgets about it.
1,"After one year of use, the microwave is starting fires"
2,"The microwave works as expected, but after 6 months, we started to notice the keypad started to get messed up."
5,"When my microwave finally broke after 15 years I was looking for something with multi function to take up less space on my counters.  This multifunction microwave is absolutely great. It does well air frying, and reheating. Although it may take a few seconds longer to microwave it’s fine with me seeing that the air fry and convection cooking is on point. I can raven make toast using the air fry option. So the amount of counter space I save without having multiple appliances is well worth the few extra seconds it takes to reheat. Definitely a great purchase."
4,Much deeper than expected
1,"The box it came in was damaged, so was the box the microwave was in..thankfully the microwave itself had Styrofoam around it, so at the moment seems ok and working.  But we shall see.Other than that, looks great."
4,"Ok.  It looks sturdy.  This one isn't straightforward. There's a learning curve for all the functions.  Sincerely, all I need for any microwave is reheating things.  This one is tricky that way.  The directions said that the reheat button is for items 20oz or more.  This is a fact. I tried a bowl of oatmeal and it was all over the place. So I dropped down to the keyboard and that's tricky.  As I said, I don't know if these things have to have all the gadgets.  That being said.  It's working.  My first microwave was in 1983 and it lasted almost 20 years. The second, 13, years. From then on 3 years. Disposable. Save the environment and make it last!"
4,Kind of loud
3,"Seemed easy enough to set up, Alexa did not like 2 microwaves and no name would work other than microwave for Alexa so had to remove other unit from WIFI.After 1st use, the clock reverted to 0:00 and never adjusted to current time.Not sure if issue with app, or with microwave itself.Then the door does not close tight, I can pull handle out about 3/16"" and the whole door moves, so pretty sure it will leak radiation if I stand too close or bump it..If my other unit wasn't acting up would return it.. but with Amazon taking 2 weeks or more to fulfill orders lately, I don't want to be without for that long..."
5,Barley worked 2 months now its sparking i saw an electric spark n heard a loud pop sound from just heating up cabbage. As soon as i pressed start.I don't know whats going on. It always burns popcorn have to heat food for over 6 minutes to get it fully heated. The plate or bowl would be so hot but the food would be cold in the middle.This is honestly the WORST MICROWAVE I HAVE EVER BOUGHT.I'm afraid to use it. I think it may blow up or something the way it was sparking.This really should be looked into.I put five stars to be seen just incase this is truly a dangerous product.
5,"Excellent products, durable. The last one went 15 years. This one is very nice looking and more powerful. Very nice"
5,So far good
1,Used at home and worked fine at first. Then no buttons worked. Wasn't child lock either.
1,I’m fairly disappointed that I bought this as a Christmas present for our new apartment. It’s already not heating up and it hasn’t even been 2 months.
4,Great microwave but both my son and I have trouble reading the control panel because it is not backlit.
4,"This appliance works great. Lots of power, sturdy, and heats well without a problem. I have only two issues.1) The 'Power level' selection button does not function. I followed the instructions word for word and it literally does nothing, so everything is heated on full power.2) The turntable makes an annoying clunking sound as it rotates.Overall, even with these quirks it's still a great machine, and well worth the price."
4,"Apart from the manual that is poorly written, I am very ok with the product so far. It delivers as it stated on Amazon"
2,"The Toshiba EM925 microwave oven is advertised as having a 0.9 cubic foot heating cavity in the Amazon listing and in the printed Toshiba specifications.  It's actually considerably smaller.  The dimensions of the cavity are 12"" x 12"" x 8"", which works out to 2/3 of a cubic foot or 0.667 cubic feet.  That makes it a small microwave, not a medium size."
3,"It rattles and does not sound nice.  If it starts to beep, it will beep 5 times, even if the door is opened.  Not nice when others are sleeping.  I was tempted to return it.  I will likely give it away and replace."
1,"DO NOT BUY - DANGEROUS!This microwave didn't even last 4 months, then caught on fire. I thought with such a catastrophic failure they would want to help out but no. Past the 30 day return policy and it's ""out of their control."" They told us to call Farberware and nothing. Very disappointed."
1,It made loud grinding noises from the start. Started making burning plastic smell after about a month. Completely died in less than 3months. Would advise not buying this item!
4,"Like the small footprint, dislike the lower oiler feature"
5,"My old microwave was 1 kw and the difference in power is noticeable. Dimensions are only a trifle bigger. I've seen complaints about the noise level, but I haven't noticed anything. I haven't had a chance to try the smooth reduced power operation, and maybe never will, except for defrosting. If it's possible to cook fish, I'd say that Panasonic have achieved something really useful!"
1,The biggest single complaint is that it vents moisture / steam under the unit on the left side.  If whatever you are cooking produces steam you must wipe up the counter under the unit after each use.None of our previous microwaves have ever done this.The touch pad is not as user friendly as the LG unit that it replaced.  The required effort on the membrane is higher.We purchased two of these units.  We are seriously considering returning them.
5,"I bought this because I need a portable microwave to take with me to a project I’m working on. I like it very, very much. It’s light enough and easy to transport. It works very well and is also extremely cute! I love the color and the retro design! I’m so glad I found this and highly recommend it for small spaces. It would be perfect for a college dorm room or an office cubicle or any other area where space is minimal. Even though it’s small, it has all the great features of a larger microwave, including a perfect little turntable. Highly recommend. 🙂👍👍👍"
2,I'm disappointed that this model doesn't perform like the one it replaced.  The reviews that sold me on this model I feel did over-rate the unit's performance. I regret buying this microwave. I can't recommend it.
3,"When you gently press the door open button, the microwave turns on. Feet are super uneven, I needed to put cardboard pieces under a few of them to stop it from wobbling. Burns our popcorn when we use the same timing that worked great on our previous microwave."
2,I've had it for about 6 months. The heating element is starting to go out.
5,This microwave has been great.  Easy to use.  Takes up half of my space my old one did and cooks better. Very quiet.
4,Looks good and runs quiet. Not sure about air fryer combo as I haven't used an air fryer yet but hopeful.
5,The Chefman Microcrisp microwave was returned and replaced within the original 30 day trial  period. The replacement did not have the problem previously encountered. This speaks to the importance of inspecting whatever you buy before the 30 day free return period as manufacturer defects or shipping damages exist with all products... Always inspect product after delivery. I am now satisfied with the Microcrisp microwave and have corrected the overall rating to reflect this.Previous subpar review:The microwave does not sit level on a level countertop surface causing it to rock back and forth and consequently does not hold steady to the surface which leads me to believe that it could eventually fall off the counter which would cause damage to it and possibly could injure a young child standing on the floor in front of it. Apparently the left front corner of it is too short by about 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch. This is rather annoying and I find it rather surprising that it is not mentioned in any of the other reviews... a potential safety hazard. I hate to report this as I think that otherwise the microcrisp feature of this microwave may potentially be a really great feature!
5,Replaced my old (at least 20 yrs.) Panasonic inverter that I loved.  This one is smaller but still quite capable.
4,"This was exactly what I was looking for except for one fact - there is no ""express"" key. I am used to being able to press a single key to heat for either 30 seconds or one minute (two different keys). With this, I have to type the time in and then press Start. I know, it does not sound like a big deal, but when this is what you are used to it is a fairly major issue. Still, it's great oven and worth 4 stars"
4,"Tiny microwave, low wattage. Looks good on counter"
3,I really see no difference in heating between models that reduce the power and ones that cycle on and off for the different power levels.  The controls are kind of clunky.  To get to power level 3 you need to press power level button 7 times.  My old Kenmore you just hit the power level button and 3.  You also can't use the kitchen timer and the oven at the same time. I could on my old one and it was great when you had something in the microwave and the oven.
5,Easy to use. Looks good in kitchen. Well made.
2,"I ordered this thinking I'd be able to fit a full-size dinner plate inside as we use the microwave for warming and reheating, not cooking.  Our plates are a hair under 11 1/8"" wide, so they should have fit but because of the frame around the opening the ""useable"" interior width is 10 7/8"", not 12.05"" as advertised.  This means that a plate will fit but ONLY if I tilt it sideways to get it through the opening - which of course could mean spilling food off the plate.  Likewise the ""useable"" height is not 8.11"" but 6 7/8"", meaning that a mug that is too full would spill if tilted to fit it inside or a tall container that is too wide to be tilted won't fit at all.  The company needs to modify the specs listed to include the dimensions of the opening and not just the interior.  This is a cute oven but we're sending ours back."
3,Microwave came with a notable dent right in the front of it.
4,Like the size
3,"Paint is chipping off from the inside-top surface. Its just 2 years old. Already we are looking at scrapping and buying from a local store, instead of trusting Amazon vendors with good quality goods."
2,"Some of my buttons don’t work so that was frustrating have to return it now , won’t go with this brand again"
3,"For the wattage level, it seems to have inconsistent results when heating at different power levels. And after only a month the front bezel trims have started coming loose on the door and control panel. It’s relatively quiet I guess. Underwhelming for the price.I would have paid a little more for a better product, and expected better with this one given the reviews and the brand name."
5,Have been using this daily for months and it’s held up! We love it!
1,"Edited 46 days later.DO NOT BUY. I HAVE USED THIS MICROWAVE FOUR TIMES. IT QUIT WORKING. Past return date.The first time I purchased a microwave since late 1970's. Do not like them.Took me forever to do the time. You must enter four numbers. ie 01:26I put in a bag of popcorn. Hit the popcorn button. The bag caught on fire.  Everything was burnt. Days later my house smells like burnt popcorn. It was a female dog to clean.Then I read the directions. I just wanted a small microwave for popcorn. Now that I know what I did wrong, life is good."
3,"It’s smaller than it looks. We got it for our little basement theater setup. We wanted something small and assumed it would at least pop a bag of porn well. It seems to heat fine and is very quiet which is great. But our standard size popcorn bags always get stuck while it spins and we end up having to decide between fully popping it and having a handful of burnt kernels, or pulling it out early so nothing gets burnt but a lot of them are left in popped. If you don’t eat microwaved popcorn, I’m sure it will be an awesome little quiet unit for you."
1,I took a chance on getting a used microwave from Amazon for a discount on price.  The minute I turned it on there was a loud banging sound while running.  I returned the unit.  At least it is easy to return items to Amazon.
3,"So, first the good news. It ""nukes"", it's relatively powerful for its size, and it has a good amount of interior space considering its compact footprint. That being said, the buttons, logic, and programming functionality are a design fiasco. Does one really need 5 loud beeps after each cycle - all the beeps are always loud and can't be turned off. It'd be nice if the beeps would cancel when I open the door so I don't wake the rest of the household when heating breakfast at 5 a.m. How about some backlighting for the barely legible buttons? There's no indication of power level short of pushing and holding the power level selector for 2s - that could have been easily integrated into the display. Why does it require one to hit reset before adding 10s/1m/10m? Seems like a lot of arbitrary non-customizable programming design decisions made by some circuit board programmer that had his/her idea of how a microwave should operate."
2,"I thought this was a great microwave while we had it, but after just over 2 years, it completely bit the dust. Won’t work at all and feels dangerously hot on the outside. So I guess my advice is if you decide to buy this, get the warranty. Don’t recommend though because that is a crazy short life span for an appliance… I expected better from Black and Decker."
3,"Bought this for my son for college.  It was great for his dorm room, and he loved the preset cook settings and raved about how well it performed and how relatively quiet it was.  Unfortunately, after 5 months of fairly steady usage (one or two uses per day) it just quit working in the middle of cooking some mac and cheese.I contacted Toshiba support, and they were very easy and friendly to work with.  They quickly refunded the purchase price since they didn't have a replacement they could send out.  The rating above reflects both the fact that the product stopped working in 5 months, but gives credit for top-notch support.  I would not hesitate to purchase another model given Toshiba's integrity."
4,"Setting the clock was a surprising challenge... Pressing and HOLDING the number buttons was the trick. The instant 30 seconds on pressing the start button (and increasing 30 seconds more upon each press) was a nice feature. The unit was a bit LOUD upon actual operation, and the BEEP upon completion continues  THREE times, even if you open the door right away, which wasn't a plus. Overall it is a fine microwave, and I would buy it again."
5,"Great features, works well at everything, and looks great in any decor. The air fry function is not spelled out in the manual, but the cooking times are. I guess you just press the air fryer button to use the air fryer function. I haven’t use that function as yet, but the others work just as intended and it works wonderfully as a microwave. I love that I can reheat foods without the sogginess of a microwave with the convection and air fryer selections. The oven is large and requires at least three inches of space in back and the non-vented side. The vented side should be open according to the recommendations. I would say at least a foot of space from any wall although not specified. It is at least 16 inches deep and about 22 inches wide. It is a very nice microwave with air fryer function if you have the space!"
2,"I don't love this microwave as much as I hoped I would. Many of the Alexa commands that it's supposed to handle don't actually work. And for some reason the clock is always an hour ahead. When I correct the time, it always reverts back to an hour ahead. But at least it serves it's main purpose of heating food."
4,"Large and powerful that cooks completely. No ""hot spots"". Worth a few extra dollars."
2,Loved the microwave.  So disappointed it didn’t last !
1,"Upon using for the first time, this microwave was extremely loud. The second surprise was that there was zero heat. Now the always inconvenient return process begins."
1,Less than 2 years of use and the button won’t pop the door out anymore!
5,"Three years ago we bought a countertop microwave, it was fine but suddenly the keypad went out.  Found this on Amazon and it's a different brand than our previous one but is almost the exact size of our old one and the controls and layout are identical.  I didn't realize Black & Decker made any appliances but this is a solid option.  Fits well on the counter and is affordably priced.  Turntable allows whatever you're cooking to be moved around without having to turn it yourself.  All in all, a solid option."
1,"I have tried contacting the company, they will not respond. This microwave a bad product. It resets randomly by just using it. Sometimes to the point it wont work unless I unplug it. The clock is useless because you have to reset it every time the microwave resets. The light went out after a few months so it's harder to cook and the door needs an extra push to close. Beyond what doesn't work, you can't use the time if your cooking or can't cook  if the timer is on."
5,Works great!
3,Microwave worked great for the first two years. Our warranty ended one month ago… today we almost caught the house on fire. The microwave started to spark and now The metal plate inside now has black marks. Pretty disappointed that this microwave did not last more than two years. I would be wary of buying this product.
5,Housewarming gift
4,"First up, the templates provided work well for mounting. Only aspect I had issues with installation were due to trying to get the top template flush in the space I had. That's not Black&Deckers issue but my own house. Everything else went fine. The cooking is hotter than my previous microwave, which could be partially why I needed to replace it.Only strange aspect of this model was the power level settings. If you use manual power levels to try to control the cooking, 1 is the highest while 10 is the lowest. That is opposite of about everything I've come across before. Hey we want full power so crank this thing all the way up to 1. Yeah, I don't think I've ever owned or heard of another device that works like that. I don't use manual power setting often, just something to be aware of when you use this."
3,I did not realize that 700 W meant I would need to estimate the time needed to be added to instructions on packages.  So my fault that way.
5,Great microwave for the price.
5,Definitely recommend this microwave for College students. It’s small
4,"This was a replacement for the one I bought 5.5 years ago. The old one just died one day, so this one was on sale, and got it. Works well, and easy to read numbers. Fits a dinner plate with ease on the turn table or one large dish. NOT tall enough for a cup over say 8 inches or so (one that holds 8 oz)."
5,Works really well with defrosting and reheating
1,"The door wouldn't stay closed at all. It doesn't even pretend to latch.  I filled out the return information 5 days ago, and still no one has come to pick up the return."
5,i am happy
2,"Works only so-so....all items done around the outside, but sometimes (60-70%) cold in the middle.  I dont recommend."
3,"This product looks good, However it is noisy, i bought it in september wish i could still return it .not happy about the sound coming from it."
1,"It broke down in less than 3 months of use. The extra warranty paid doesn't take care of it, so I have to take it to the post office by myself (it's heavy!) and send it to RCA with all the expenses paid for me. Hating it. I should have paid more for something better."
3,"I researched microwaves and decided on this one. It is roomy and has good power. It is big, so you need ample counterspace. Within a year and a half, it started arcing, buzzing, and I thought many times it would catch fire. This happened no matter what was in the oven--something frozen, something thawed, liquid, solid. I think maybe some food got stuck on the part where the microwaves emit, and over time that continued to burn (yes, I did clean it regularly). Eventually a hole burned in that part of the oven. I am putting it in the scrap metal collection and I bought a Black and Decker model today. I hope it lasts. The Farberware was much more expensive than the B&D. It should have lasted longer."
4,"I'm really happy with this.  It is not an oven replacement.  I use the convection oven for things like toasting bread or reheating pizza so that its crispy, not soggy, and it does a great job at that.  Its slow to heat up and kind of noisy - I can't imagine using it for real baking or cooking, but its a great way to get rid of a toaster oven, clear up counter space, and avoid using the full-size oven for little things.  The microwave works as well as any other microwave.  For not much more than the cost of a decent microwave, I consider the oven function more than worth the money."
4,It works fine.  The buttons are particular.  If you don’t hit it just right you can’t push the 1 2 3 etc. other than that no complaints this far.  Easy to set up and operate.
3,"So far, this is the most mediocre microwave I've ever used. It doesn't seem to cook very evenly, and is fairly low power. Joke's on me, though. I bought it because it has a picture of a potato."
4,"Compact, but just right to warm up a dinner plate or smaller dish. Power is plenty. It is light and will slide on the counter when you open the door, so you need a rubber mat or feet to keep it in place. The timer beeps loud for five beeps when done, even after you open the door. Not great when try to be quiet in the morning."
1,"After 10 months of use,  the Microwave started running when ever it was plugged in regardless of settings on the panel,  also panel fail.  This would be an easy way to have your kitchen and house burn down."
5,Activation panel hard to read with dark background. I have on cabinet only 3 ft high so hard to even see where numbers are. Best microwave I’ve had. Happy with it.
1,I ordered this microwave air fryer combo for my small office. The microwave stopped working after about a month. The toaster and air fry modes function but no microwave. It was under warranty and we were supposed to receive a replacement early December. When I check the order it says it is running late but on the way. There is no tracking number available. I regret this purchase. Had I simply gone to a local store I could have exchanged the product already.
2,"Microwave worked great at first, seemed to heat evenly and quickly. After a year or so it developed a slight electrical wine when plugged in but not running. About six months later, mid way though heating food, it started to smell strongly of burnt plastic and fried electronics and was immediately unplugged. The food inside still smelled fine so we knew the microwave itself had given up. I would not recommend this unit but still gave it 2 starts because it worked well before it completely gave up."
5,"I've had this microwave for over two years now, and I use it a lot. It's great for heating things up quickly, and because of some of the features, it really is difficult to burn up the food. I'd definitely buy it again if I had to, or just needed two of them."
1,The smart part of the microwave was very poorly designed and even after days of trying to get it to work still was unable to make it fully function. No this was not a issue with the user. I'm a network engineer with more certifications than most people dream of. Then the microwave died less than a month of use. I looked online about the issue and it seemed to be a common issue which means poor quality control. Will most likely never buy a Toshiba product again because really felt burned after this and Amazon made it worse claiming the first time they tried to stop by and pick it up. I checked video they didnt knock or ring the doorbell just put note on the door that was already written. Lucky for me my door bell camera is motion activated and would have never understood how my family and me missed him as we were all at home that day. We ended up having to take microwave to drop off center. It was just a real bad experience all around. But bad review isnt for Amazon's poor pickup service that day it is 100% the product being poorly made and lack of Quality Control on Toshiba's side.
1,We've had this microwave for less than a month and are having to return it.  It has started coming on by itself and will not shut off unless you unplug from the wall. Very disappointing.
2,"I purchased this microwave for my son’s room at college almost 2 years ago. After one year, it was spitting out sparks many times when he would put things like popcorn, in there…. and just things that should be able to go inside a microwave. He always used microwavable containers, but I even noticed when I put something in there to reheat it sparked. I had to quickly turn it off and unplug it. I’m probably going to have to throw this microwave away. A waste of money for me!!"
1,Thought this item was new and it wasn't Ewen had a dirty glass tray I side of it
4,"The above makes it a little harder to use, I'm NOT saying they said it was lighted, just that is my only critique now that I've had it/used it, for awhile."
5,Very nice and well packaged for shipping. Fast shipping!
2,Doesn’t heat very well
5,"When this came, I was not impressed.  Kind of small and not that expensive.  But it does it all!  I was able to cook things I had never done before.  There is a great video on You Tube for this oven with a guy named Jeremy on making meatloaf in the convection and Red Baron mini pizzas.  I thought I hated frozen pizza until now.  Meatloaf was easy and wonderful and cheap!  The air fry was a little hard to figure out, but it works.  I make things like egg rolls and French Fries all the time and they are really crispy and crunchy and not soggy or greasy."
1,The media could not be loaded.Push button stopped working after just a few weeks. Contacted Amazon. They could only ask a few basic questions about whether food was stuck somewhere. It was still in brand new condition so definitely wasn’t anything like that. It was just poorly made. They passed me to Black and Decker. Sent them a bunch of information. They told me to reach out to a supplier who said to reach out to a different supplier. Surprised to find no meaningful help on a brand new product that is not working properly. They claim to have a warranty on the product but it doesn’t do much good if they won’t deliver on it.
2,Doesn't cook evenly at allId say after 12 minutes a cerealBowl Size bowl of food shouldn't have cold spotsThis is a chunk of garbageCant recomend
2,This is a cool buy it works when it’s taken care of…it’s either your food will not be warm after a year or it will stop working in general…I didn’t buy it from Amazon but just saying the brand is giving you what it’s worth. Mines basically stopped working after a year
1,"Ok. It is a microwave. It heats and cooks. Does not fit our bowls that we use to cook. It claims to be 0.7 cu. ft.  Inside dimensions are 10-7/8x11.5x6.75. Less than 0.5 cu. ft. You do the math. Wanted to buy an under counter to replace our old failed GE but could only find 0.5 cu. ft. GE under counter so opted for this. Now stuck with small unit that is taking up counter space.  Not as advertised!  The dimensions advertised are not what the unit has to offer (it’s smaller).  If you are looking for a 0.7 cu.ft. model, this isn’t it."
4,"This microwave is a bit smaller than I expected, but it’s not too bad. Since it’s small, the wattage is about at a larger microwave’s medium, so if you’re making anything in it maybe add an extra 45 seconds to 1 minute."
5,I bought this for my son & wife for housewarming gift!  They were overjoyed.  Say it works wonderfully
3,Good value good product. Handling of parcel seemed a little rough which scares me a bit about the longevity of this item after being manhandled
3,"I did a lot of research before getting this microwave and I find it OK but in some aspects disappointing. It fits in a small space, is quiet and, best of all, you can turn off the beeps. Why does anyone need five (5) beeps every time it is finished cooking? I have low vision and my biggest disappointment is how hard this machine is to set up and use. If the deadline to return  had not passed (I am deeply frustrated about this) I would return it in a heartbeat and get another make and model. Otherwise, I am sure this would work well for most people."
2,Very small. Only used once but took 3 tries to warm up left overs from the refrig.  May be returning as something might be wrong with it.
4,"Nice looking, very small profile, works great. Writing on buttons is very, very small, so only gave 4 vs. 5 stars. You really have to memorize or put your nose close to the appliance to read the labels. Writing is kind of tiny dark grey on black, so....hard to read. If they correct that, 5 stars."
3,"I returned this because AirFry feature is completely useless. Convection (oven) feature was awesome. Directions were seriously lacking, showing only ""how"" to use each feature, with nothing on using any feature for any real-life use. Also, buttons weren't sensitive enough, needing to be touched too hard."
1,"The actual microwave is fine, however, the color is very misleading. There are two versions: 1) Stainless Steel and 2) Black Stainless Steel Microwave Oven.We ordered “1) Stainless Steel” but only the front is Stainless Steel. The sides and top are black. So then what color is the Back Stainless Steel Microwave Oven? The images show that as Stainless Steel for the front too…The area of our kitchen this is in we primarily see the side of it so now we have a black item in our kitchen where everything else is actual Stainless Steel."
5,"Good Quality, I'm happy, no funny sounds and very quiet"
1,"The oven is OK- hard to read buttons because panel is not back-lit, but it works fine. But it came with a damaged pan. I have been dealing with Toshiba ""customer care"" since Nov. 2021 purchase (10 months now) & still haven't received a replacement pan. Amazon initially offered a credit for the pan, but I was concerned I didn't know what material would be safe in a combination oven like this so I elected to go through Toshiba for a replacement.  Bad Idea! I recommend trying another brand."
4,"Overall this is a good microwave, and a fair convection over, the 4th or 5th microwave convection oven I have owned over the years, and I would rate convection performance on this one some where in the middle of the bunch, though it is cheaper than some others I have owned / own, so good bang for the buck.  I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars due to a general feel of being less sturdy than my previous convection / microwave as well as general performance that is just a little short of being great.  I would like to give it 4.5 stars if that were an option."
2,"Pros: Works as expected and does the job a microwave should do.Cons: You can find the same size and wattage for much less money. I tried to cancel the order when I found a cheaper one (by Hamilton Beach) at Walmart but it was too late and, as I didn't want to bother returning such a heavy item, I just went ahead and kept it. As for ease of use, I much prefer microwaves that allow you to just push a button to open the door. On this one, you have to use the physical handle, which often ends up moving / sliding the microwave around because it's so lightweight."
1,The door is sagging. Not sure if that will cause radiation to leak out but the door is not flush in line with the unit...it is sagging. Very disappointing for a brand new unit.
1,"I just found Warning the box: this product can expose you to chemicals including phthalates or other chemicals which are known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm.What is really mean?  Do all microwaves have this kind of warning? Please explain it, otherwise, I'll want to return it."
4,"When pressing the 30 sec button, you still have to press start. It is not automatic.  To be honest i have not read the manual completely and do not generally use microwaves for defrosting. I prefer defrosting from freezer to inside fridge a few hours or under running warm water. This microwave is quiet and heats well. Size is smaller than the last one i had, a sharp carousel. The glass trays are interchangeable... so i can use it as a replacement. I like to recycle microwave tempered glass plates as pot or pan covers or as cutting boards. I would have bought the LG if they had the 1.3 cuft size, their look is what i wanted. This one is fine for now... i hope it lasts this is the reason i bought this brand ... dependability."
1,"Horrible!!! It stops in the middle of cooking. The time stopped working on it a week after getting it. We called the company they want us to pay to have it shipped back to them to ""look"" at it. Not worth it for a 40 dollar microwave, I guess you get what you pay for!! Junk!!"
4,"Great size, and great power. This microwave is your final destination of microwaves. It works great, easy enough to use, and has a good variety of functions. It's very spacious as well. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is the film on the door has gotten a good-sized bubble in it after usage. So that might be a slight concern if you're a person who likes to frequently steam items."
2,I bought this to replace my same size GE microwave that died after 10 yrs.  The one I received is NOT the one pictured on Amazon website.  What is different is the turntable in my new microwave is completely different from the one pictured.  The plate provided does not fit well onto the turntable gear.  It is wobbily and if you don't place anything other than a dinner plate (i.e coffee mug to glass jar) exactly in the middle of the glass plate the unbalanced action of the turntable could topple the mug or jar and spill its contents.  This could be very dangerous.
3,"Not a good buy for me. Will not even make popcorn correctly. Inadequate power. Makes a horrible noise when used, wasn't bad when I first used it, but has gotten steadily louder. I miss my old one."
4,"No express buttons. Very powerful. Things boil over very quickly. Even at a lower power, doesn’t seem to make a difference. Have to use it at 30 second intervals so it doesn’t boil over."
4,"this is a pretty good microwave, but it is sorta weak so i have to microwave everything for like 1.5x longer than in my old one. it's also surprisingly small, smaller than an average microwave"
5,"My microwave is just wonderful! I have a small kitchen so this fits just perfect for me! So really glad I took the chance on it, well worth it!"
4,"I like this oven. It cooks very well. Cooks food well Wish it had an auto sensor to cook bacon like my old oven but that’s just something I have to get used to, as well as the missing handle to close the door quietly. Was glad to find a large model that would fit my microwave cart. Overall a great product."
5,"Great little microwave.  Build solid, quiet.  Good buy!"
4,"This is the classic, small, cheap, low-power microwave that has graced millions of dorm rooms, office break rooms and the like.  If you look carefully, you'll see that most of these small, 700 watt microwaves have absolutely identical control panels, meaning that the guts of this one and most of the others are likely very similar.  I am sure Faberware licenses their name to whoever makes this, and the same factory in China probably makes most of the other ones that compete with it.  A low-power microwave seems to be a commodity product at this point.  So I would get whatever one is cheapest, in my case it was this black Faberware, but your mileage may vary.Advantages: It's cheap, it is very compact and good for small spaces, and because it has lower power it is less likely to trip a breaker than a full-sized microwave.  This also means it is a good choice for an RV, cabin with a moderate off-grid power system, etc.  I confirmed that even a Jackery 1000 can run it for several minutes without overheating, although it actually pulls just a tiny bit over 1,000 watts.  The 700 watt rating is the energy going into your food, not how much power the microwave uses, I suppose.  But even pulling 1000 watts, it doesn't completely eat the battery in the Jackery 1000 to run this thing, it goes down 1-2% per minute of operation, meaning you could absolutely power this in a power outage with the big Jackery power station or something equivalent.The disadvantages are simple too:  It has a bit less power than a regular microwave so your food will take a bit longer to heat up.  It can get stuff just as hot, it just takes a bit longer.  That is really no big deal unless you are trying to microwave a frozen dinner and the recipe is designed for a regular, full-power microwave and you'll have to guess how much more time it will need.  More significantly, the oven itself is pretty small, meaning any oversized dinner plate or particularly tall item is not going to fit inside it.  But it otherwise has everything a regular microwave has including a small turntable to help your food cook more evenly.Most people will step up to a larger and more powerful microwave as their daily driver.  If, for whatever reason, that doesn't work for you, this thing is fine and it isn't really that big of a step down from a normal sized microwave."
3,"The microwave is the perfect size for my needs, but can't use it for the present!The ""Turntable Shaft"" was NOT included, so rather useless at the moment! How to get the missing item? Please advise! Thanks!"
2,"We were having trouble finding a compact microwave that could accommodate our 11 inch plates. Thought this one would be a winner based on the dimensions listed online. While the interior dimensions were accurate, the actual opening of the door was smaller and the plate could only fit through if heavily tilted. Not exactly what you want for a plate loaded up with food. Outside of this, it seemed to be a fine microwave."
2,This was to be used for a blind and visually impaired person in Amazon Alexa says most of the time microwave not responding. It goes online and off-line on a regular basis when it works it works great with no issues but it’s intermittent. So disappointed with the consistency of quality.
4,works well = but very noisy when operating
5,It’s your standard microwave.  I would not call it basic nor is it high end.  Perfect for warming up some cold coffee or leftovers.
1,"Absolutely the worse thing my wife has bought, I complain about this thing more than anything in the house. Warming up stuff would be easier on the stove. Takes 10 minutes for anything thick like soup. Oh and anything slightly big like a general sized bag of popcorn knocks the spinning tray off or it catches and doesn’t spin. If you like waiting half a century for anything warmed up and the capacity for a tike size bowl go for it"
5,Excelente articulo
3,"This microwave gets hot on the outside after only a few minutes on 100% power. It's also very noisy. Many are saying the sensor features work well, but mine heats much too much even using the ""less"" button (which would be a great idea if it worked correctly). It also doesn't seem to work as well as my previous, 10 year old microwave."
5,"This microwave works well and is a great value.  The controls are not intuitive for detailed operations, but what you do use (set time and start) is well-implemented - you can press a single button to start for 30 seconds or 1-6 minutes.  I give it 5 stars for what is doesn't do, compared to my last two ""inverter"" design microwaves that both went to recycling after completely unsatisfactory service lives of only 14 months each - just out of warranty.  The great Toshiba doesn't trip my ground fault breaker, it doesn't trip my arc fault circuit breaker, it doesn't make arcing and burning noises in the magnetron cavity, and it doesn't emit electrical smoke.  I'm hopeful this great Toshiba ""non inverter"" style will last a long time.  And it will be a long time before I buy an LG or Panasonic inverter microwave again."
3,This product works great but it’s super tiny. I looked at the dimensions before I bought it but realistically not many things fit inside. So think about what you’ll be microwaving before you buy it.
5,"All functions on this appliance work as advertised. I have used this as a convection oven and an air fryer but mostly use it as a microwave oven. It’s accurate, easy to use, and the best I’ve had yet for defrosting. Past microwave ovens either didn’t defrost fully or started cooking the outside before the core of the frozen food thawed. This defrost setting is spot-on accurate. If I put in a pound of frozen ground meat, hit Defrost, and set for 1 pound, it’s thawed completely without cooking it. My only complaint, and this is really minor, is that the buttons are difficult to read. I’m used to them now and it’s not a problem."
4,A plus is that you can turn-off the alarm sound when your food/drink is done.
2,"It was OK while it worked, but it lasted less than 2 years."
2,First of all the microwave runs hot. Never have I had a microwave that is hot to the touch while reheating. And if u can believe it there is no light. Now I am 74 years old and got my first microwave in 1978. And I’ve only had 4 microwaves in my lifetime. So I do know what I’m talking about. I thought Farberware was a good brand. My mistake. I would not recommend this microwave.
4,Err above
4,Not the most powerful but definitely not the worst either. It’s a great microwave for the price. It’s small so it fits great for limited space. I bought this one for my classroom and it’s easy to hide. Only thing is food takes an extra 30 seconds to a minute to get warm.
1,This makes a loud noise and I can’t even heat up ramen quickly. Not worth the money
3,"I replaced my microwave with an identical one thinking it must be defective, but the new one is just as bad. I understand now that 900W is underpowered by today's standards although I was a little surprised so much extra time is required. The killer for me is that the heating is uneven so that some parts of a plate will be too hot while others are almost frozen. You can see why I assumed it was defective and was so disappointed that this highly-rated machine turns out to be badly designed.PS It is still possible the second was defective too. Amazon was good about replacing the first one but after three days I'm still trying to do the second ""free return."" I ordered a more expensive Farberware this time and I hope it will not be yet a third turkey."
5,This microwave looks great and works perfectly.  It does take up a lot of real estate.
2,Takes a long time to heat things... longer than it should. The size is great!
5,Great quality for the price. Great for small counter tops. Like that it has child lock. Would definitely recommend it and easy to use.
2,"This seems like a great little microwave for smaller spaces but I needed it to put in an alcove cut out space above my counter top. Its a space saver.  However, I almost had a terrible accident as I pulled open the door when I had heated up some soup in there and I nearly pulled the microwave off the shelf, tilting  the oven and boiling soup could have come flying out. Its not that heavy and should really be grounded to the shelf if it's places above the counter top.  For this space I do not need a microwave with a pull handle but one that you press a button at the bottom of the microwave oven and the door swings open itself.  I am returning it for this reason but if it sits on a counter top it would be a great little microwave. Just thought it was good to warn folks of this potential hazard that could occur. Otherwise a great product for the money."
5,"I use my Microwave often (no surprise) Easy touchpad controls. I don't car for the black interior; too hard to see if any food debris is on the interior. Much prefer white interior. Not for small spaces. read the measurements. It is a largeish countertop unit. It is red on the front, black on the top and sides."
4,"Door is noisy, but get used to it.  Ability to turn sound off is really nice!"
5,"I am very pleased with the Combo Microwave.  It is the right size, it works great.  I love the air fryer. My husband and I are disabled due to a traumatic accident and live in an RV.  We have limited space but this Microwave works perfectly for us."
1,"I wanted to like this sleek looking microwave.  But the truth is, it’s not a very good one.  It is super LOUD and reheated very inconsistently.  Steam escaped out of the door all the time making the top of the door wet.  And the final blow, it became completely defective in a year and a half of gentle use.  Panasonic tech support said to call a local repair company, which they kindly provided to me in a timely manner.  However, the cost of repair was quoted at 3/4 the cost of the unit and the turn around time for repair was 2 weeks or more (dependent on how fast their receive the replacement parts from Panasonic corporate).  Purchased a new Faberware microwave that has less power but somehow heats faster.  New Faberware unit also heats consistently and is much much quieter."
1,"We bought this microwave just over 3 months ago, and it worked fine at first.  However, we didn’t use it very often because it was summer and we were cooking outside a lot.  The past few weeks it has started shutting off randomly, over-heating, and not warming food.  Unfortunately, you have to send it in to get it fixed, and wait for it for 6-10 weeks.  This is our only microwave, so waiting 2-3 months isn’t really an option."
3,Does not heat food up very well
5,Works great!
3,"Great little microwave, but as someone else pointed out, after only a couple weeks of use the plastic coating where the number 1 button is is starting to bubble and peal away."
3,I mean we literally can’t and couldn’t afford better than this but it works 7/10 times. sometimes it won’t cook in the middle but it is the cheapest option so
5,We needed a smaller sized Microwave to replace the one that died in our RV.  This was a perfect fit.  It works very well.
4,"Works like any microwave so no complaint there.  It's supposed to work with Alexa, which is does most of the time.  For whatever reason, connection to the microwave drops quite a bit.  It seems lazy to have a microwave that works with Alexa but it actually comes in really handy.  I guess you can call me lazy..."
1,"This product was very defective I purchased it and after using it for a couple of months my husband and I heard a noise in the kitchen we went to check it out and the microwave was spitting fire my husband quickly unplugged it from the wall outlet. The smell in the kitchen from that microwave was atrocious, had we not been home when this occurred we would’ve had a massive fire when we returned home and our home would have been damaged. I’ve contacted Toshiba on several occasions provided proof of my purchase. The last time I heard from Toshiba was on November 6 in an email thanking me for providing all the information they needed for my case.  I have yet to receive a refund or a replacement I even took out insurance on this microwave that the insurance company refuses to honor the company Toshiba is refusing to honor my purchase payment as well please Think twice about  this product I would not want anyone’s home to catch fire as a result of purchasing it. In My opinion this is not a replicable company and the product we received  was defective."
1,I purchased this oven 18 months ago and then one day it was dead. I tried to re set it like the book said and tried another outlet buy nothinf so I called Panasonic for a service center in Arizona and they dont have one. The warranty was 1 year everything then years 2-5 only micron tube but that wasn't the problen so they opened a cace and had me send pictures and the next day they denied claim but said to ship it to them at my cost both ways plus repair which is very expensive so I paid $200 for a microwave that died at 18 months. If you buy panasonic make sure they have a service center in your city or buy a local warranty even if the micron tube went out only the part would be covered for warranty. This is my second and last panasonic product that has not lasted.
5,"Unfortunately our old microwave of 25-30 yrs just died...RIP.  We are updating our kitchen but the appliances will not be in for another 4 months, 1 yr from ordering!  We had to break down and get a countertop one during this period.  This oven is BIG!  I can actually fit a large dinner plate in it.  It seems a little 'scary' at first, but once you go over the operating instructions and use it a few times, it's very easy and intuitive.  Our old microwave was SSSOOO old it had none of the functions that this model has (and also couldn't fit a dinner plate).The only down-side after using it for a month is that it is much louder as it's running and the 'beeping' is very loud but I think that may be able to be turned off.  So when I finally receive all my new appliances, this one will be stored away as a spare, just in case model...."
4,very good microwave
2,"My plates and bowls get hotter then the food. Have to microwave food from the refrigerator again and again, and it’s not even frozen food! And I have it on the highest level. Not impresssd, especially for the cost."
5,"impressed.  The unit is more powerful than expected.  Simple to use like any microwave.  Good features all in one so no need for separate devices for air fry, convection or microwave."
1,Item did not work.
5,I love this microwave oven thank you.
1,I bought a used model. It was shipped out without being tested. The door sensor was not working so it didn't recognize the door as being closed and so would never turn on.I returned it to Amazon for a full refund
3,"The microwave oven worked fine for the 4.5 years it lasted. I would have expected it to last longer. I bought it, set it up in my kitchen, didn't move it, washed it regularly, didn't use it all too much. But it only lasted 4.5 years before dying. I would have expected it to last longer than that."
5,Sleeper hit of this microwave is the ability to turn off all beeps.
2,"It's luck if the magnetron hits the right part of the food to heat it but it's worth it for all the exact same features a microwave from the early 80's had and nothing more.I owned a behemoth microwave from the 80's and it had all the same features, exact same display, and buttons this does. It has the same stupid (never throw out) manual to tell you how to cook food but this is 2021 there should have just been a computer on the microwave to tell me how to cook my food and no manual.Also I would trade variable power magnetron with one that's got some aim. As best I can figure it's off to the lightbulb side -it really wouldn't hurt if Ghost Recon got some target practice to hit somewhere near center.I got to go. I need to fight off some cavemen because they saw this microwave and they want it real bad."
1,"The wattage on this microwave was low, so it took longer for food to cook which was fine.  It was the perfect size for our small space.  Today, 65 days after ordering this microwave on Amazon, it broke down.  While I was trying to melt butter in a glass bowl, the microwave started making a weird noise and blue/ yellow flashes came from inside the microwave.  We took the bowl out and hit start a few times with an empty microwave and the same thing happened every time.  Disappointed it didn't last at least a year and I'm not able to return it due to it being 65 days since purchase. Don't buy this- it's a waste of money & material!"
2,I bought two of these microwaves. One of them broke just outside the return window. The H97 error that shows is not covered under the warranty and will cost twice the amount of the microwave to fix it.Disappointed.
2,"This bad boy sounds like an aircraft taking off when you heat up your food. If you don’t mind your home sounding like a factory floor, then this thing is a value. If you don’t like loud noises then maybe this isn’t for you"
3,"All in all, if I had not had a better microwave for over ten years, I might think this unit was better. I didn't realize 900 watts was so poor. I would have bought a higher wattage. When you push the button to open it, the unit slips backwards (you have to brace it), the button is not easy to push, and is noisy. I don't care for this unit, but for 900 watts, it can be all right until I can buy another more suitable microwave. The price was ok, so maybe I should not complain. It has nice features and it's easy to use in that respect. Because of the low wattage, it takes a lot longer to heat things up, which I am getting used to. Also, being lightweight, it was easy to lift. This unit would be good for someone who has never had a better unit, or who cannot afford something nicer. I consider this a good unit for possibly a dorm room, or for something that will not be permanent."
1,The first two microwaves shipped were damaged. The microwave housing was actually dented and crumpled despite the fact that they were packed in the original boxes. Third time I ordered I measured the interior and it is much smaller than detailed on the product description. Won't fit a dinner plate without tipping it. The link to report inaccurate info regarding this product does not work.
5,"I got this microwave in white color because all our appliances in the kitchen are of white color. Finding appliances in white color is becoming harder over the years. We're not willing to replace all our appliances and we're not willing to mix and match. So, we struggle to find the best white ones and compromise on a lot of things.Our previous microwave (Whirlpool) was in a cabinet and had trim kit. That microwave gave a lot of trouble over the years and we finally got tired of getting the repairs done. I temporarily bought a cheap microwave from a local B&M store for interim use until we find a suitable microwave.All our search was unsuccessful. White color, trim should be available, and everything should fit well within the cabinet space. We settled for this Panasonic microwave even though it doesn't come with a trim and it is plain and simple without any modern amenities. I had to add a piece of wood to the cabinet to cover a gaping hole, but at least I didn't have to hire a professional.Positives:+ Large. Quite large in fact.+ Powerful enough. Heats up quite fast due to the inverter technology.+ Inverter technology works well.+ Genius Sensor works very well and cooks vegetables just perfect+ Tiny LED light inside provides a lot of lightNegatives:- Old school. It doesn't even have quick time buttons. if you want 2 minutes, you have to press 2,0,0,start. Even the 30 second quick button requires to press the start button afterwards. The cheap interim microwave was lot more user friendly.- Closing the door make a lot of noise. Very useful if you want to wake up the household in the morning. I found a trick to reduce the noise: keep the door open button pressed while closing the door and release it after closing the door.- No fancy functions offered by newer microwave ovens available in the market- When the heating cycle is completed, it insists on making 5 beeps. Opening the door won't stop that. No way to silence it.We are very happy with this unit because (1) it satisfies most of our needs, (2) reasonably priced, and (3) works very well."
1,"This microwave worked as it should for a few days, then the power started cutting out. Currently, if I hold the power cord at a particular angle it will power on but if I move it loses power. Don't buy this product"
1,"The media could not be loaded.This item has the potential to be great: it’s compact, easy to use, easy to maintain, etc. But after a handful of uses over less than a week, my units power supply is no longer consistent and constantly shuts on/off, emitting a mechanical smell from the rear. Amazon will process a refund after I send it back, I elected to NOT receive a replacement."
1,Worked like normal for a little but but then out of nowhere started sparking and arcing electricity whenever we tried to used it. Immediately unplugged. I've never had or seen a microwave break down my entire life. What a pos
2,Loud and doesn't feel like it will last.
5,Because our use and space for a microwave is very limited InMySmallKitchen ...The Farberware Classic FMO07AHTBKJ was an excellent compromise.  It would have been nice to have more power in this small package but the trade off of a few extra seconds to get water or other beverage hot (about 80% of our use of a microwave) is worth.If you use your microwave for defrosting (we use our NinjaFoodi PC) or cooking extensively (we do not) then this might not be your best choice.Caveat:  Be sure to look at all listings for this product - as with all things Amazon prices can vary widely from seller to seller.
1,"I rarely write reviews but had to for this product... the product itself and the customer service experience have both been awful.Bought the RCA 1.6 cubic foot over range microwave and installed it without issues except that it is really heavy (heavier than other similar models). Worked fine for ONE day, and then the appliance kept saying it was on ""Pause"" and nothing we did corrected the issue. We called RCA support and they were of little help, with the only suggestion to leave the appliance unplugged for 10 minutes, and when that did nothing, instructing us to return the microwave to Amazon for a replacement. (Would like to add that RCA support seemed to be handled by an overseas company and the support rep expected me to sit on the phone with him for the 10 minutes!!!).Replacement came and worked for 2 months before breaking again. Mid-operation, the microwave just stopped and when I tried to continue with the cooking, it never heated again.... as in never, ever again, despite everything else seemingly working fine. Again, we went through the all of the troubleshooting which was unsuccessful (apparently the issue is either the diode or magnetron, one is repairable and the other is not, but neither should fail within 2 months!), so we had an electrician come out to check the outlet and circuit, and he confirmed everything was fine.We don't want a 3rd RCA microwave and trying to get our money back from RCA at this point has been a real chore. We are now purchasing a GE model and hope the quality will be a bit better."
4,I was looking for a small countertop microwave and this one fit my needs.  I was disappointed to find it dented when removing it from the box.  The box was not damaged which means it left the factory like this.
5,"This little guy will do it all. It has the only function a microwave truly needs: +30 seconds. I have never used any other setting and itcooked and heated everything perfectly. After 4 years, the inside paint was flaking and after a chili explosion we had to buy a new one. Our kitchen has such a weird horrible spot for a microwave that this is the only thing that will fit. However, it’s perfect. Also it comes in red!"
5,"I was in need of a new microwave as I'd burned popcorn in my old one and, try as I might, couldn't get the stain out. This time, I decided on getting a white fronted one, mainly because it makes seeing the button option easier. I have had the microwave about a month now, using it over 5 times a day to heat up items or heat water for tea.I found the hardest thing in set up was peeling off the label on the panel. Because this is a basic sort of microwave, it is easy to use. I also find like the grey rather than white inside. The noise when in use that some find loud, doesn't seem that loud so that isn't an issue for me.I am very pleased with this microwave and pleased I got the white fronted one. Will update if things change."
2,"If you use a microwave to heat and eat processed foods, reheat meals, or other simple tasks this model will be ok.  For the heavy duty cook, like me, who uses the microwave to cook entire meals from scratch, it is woefully inadequate.  The touchpad only shows numbers, or time remaining, not the level or choice of item (oatmeal, rice, frozen veg, etc), and it requires one to look at the sticker to find the appropriate level for sensor cooking, which is located infuriatingly at the bottom front of the open door, in very small print.  I don't notice any difference with the touted ""inteverted technology"", no difference in time with my previous microwaves (especially the LG), but a lot more trouble to get the cooking levels correct.  Also limited in the weight of food + dish being used, it cannot handle a 4 qt. container of soup, while the size capacity is large, this Panasonic motor cannot handle heavy items, like a roast, turkey, or lasagna.  And only one ""beep"" when food is ready, my LG kept beeping a reminder, you'd better be in the vicinity of this sole beep.  This Panasonic uses a 2-4 step process to start: first the selection, time, power level, then start.  I like my other LG: once the section is made, it starts automatically.  I would not buy this Panasonic again."
2,"Cheap price. However, what took two minutes to heat in my old microwave now takes 6-8 minutes. I’d return it if we weren’t going to redo the kitchen in the next year. Would never recommend this product."
5,"This microwave has been a game-changer in my kitchen. Its extensive range of settings, including the air-fryer function, has made cooking and reheating a breeze. The air-fryer produces crispy and delicious results without the need for extra appliances, saving valuable counter space. It's versatile, efficient, and a must-have for any kitchen looking to maximize its potential."
3,The display is dark and it’s difficult to see controls. Not as powerful as my older microwave.
2,Too small and it takes a long time to warm the food. Some of them like chicken for example would take 3 to 4 minutes as other microwave with 1 1/2 min or 2 would be hot
4,"Quit big as far as space it takes up on counter. Be sure to measure your space. Otherwise, It is pe r fact! Works better than any microwave I have ever owned."
3,"Took it out of the box, set it on the counter and immediately knew something was off. One of the ""legs"" is much shorter than the others. I had to prop something under it to keep it stable."
5,I really like this for the size but every time i open the door the whole microwave moves cause it is so light. Small problem though. I still really like it!
1,No instructions for broil or convection cooking.  Other instructions incomplete.  Makes me think this was a returned item or a display item.  I need the model number to get complete instructions.
5,It works fine. It does slide around on countertop. The dark grey inside is a downside. They could have used stainless steel which is problem more expensive or a lighter color enamel surface.
5,Looks bigger...but fit perfectly. Looks great and operates just as well. It gave my kitchen just a touch of an updated appearance. I am very satisfied.
3,"We picked this up for our cabin - because we are limited on wattage, we went with a smaller unit.  It works well, and it's really nice looking.  However there are a few items I really don't like about it.First, the start and stop button are in horrible positions - they are backwards - and the start button should always be the different color.  I keep hitting Stop because of its position and color.  Drives me nuts.Second, the default on microwaves should be a timed cook - I should just be able to hit a few numbers and the Start button.  But on this one, I have to hit the Timed cook button first.  Otherwise the number buttons are used for ""1 touch cook"" which I hate with a passion.Third, its a bit loud for its size, but I can live with that.This is really a 4-star item, but because I hate the 1-touch-cook buttons so bad, it loses another star.PROS- Decent price- Really good lookingCONS- Button placement, button design and UX- A bit on the loud side"
4,So i havnt gotten to actually using it yet but as soon ad I opened the box he first thing I noticed was it was dented and it doesn't too bad but it definitely isn't great when u just buy something but everything is there ans it worked just fine Turing it om fits right on my counter and simple touch pad cheap but worth
3,Good microwave but it wanders off high power level without warning or knowledge & you don't know until you take the food out.
3,"When I received the microwave,  I noticed that it was not steady, it rocks a little....something was off at the bottom, I did not send it back because at the time,  I needed it."
2,Door is to loud when shutting it have to be very gentle in making it quiet and the timer is extremely loud and tried to fix it like the booklet says but doesn't work
2,"This microwave worked great for 11 months.  Then it just died.  I can't get Panasonic to respond to my attempts to contact them.Up date: Panasonic did finally respond to me and suggested a repair shop I could take it to.  After 3 months, the repair shop determined that it was not repairable.  After some  online exchanges with their customer services people, Panasonic did give me a full refund.  I am pleased.  It took 4 months and some constant followup and effort.Thank you Panasonic for standing by your warranty."
4,"Nice quality very quiet, like it very much, well worth the price"
5,"Very attractive small size microwave.  It comes with a 10 inch diameter removable plate that revolves during the cooking process to promote even heating.  I found this to be very effective after testing the unit.  The maximum size dinner plate that you could set inside this microwave appears to be around 10 inches.  After receiving this unit, during shopping trips to Target and The Home Depot, I noticed models by GE and Black & Decker that looked almost exactly like this unit with the same brushed stainless steel trim, the same button layout and the same words on the buttons.  Looks like these units were all made by the same manufacturer in China and they just put different company names at the bottom of the door.  This unit is relatively light, so if have it sitting on a counter where you want it up against the wall and you grab the handle and open the door, sometimes you will drag the entire unit away from the wall.  I found that the best way is to open the door with your left hand and to hold the top of the unit above the control panel with your right hand.In summary, I found this model to be very attractive, space saving, even heating and it has plenty of usefull settings.  If you are heating a microwaveable meal that recommends a specific cooking time in an 1100 watt microwave, I would add a few extra seconds to your cook time due to this being a 700 watt unit and test the results."
5,"We really like this microwave! This is my 4th microwave since I have lived here; which is about 31 years. This has some wonderful features! Love the turbo defroster!  What makes this different is that it defrosts very efficiently by the weight of the meat. I think that it makes it safer as opposed to the previous way which could cook part of the meat. So, before I freeze the meat, I weigh it and mark it on the bag. A couple of things surprised me. One is the weight of the microwave compared to my GE Profile which was the last one to die. The other thing is that there isn't a glass window in the door. It appears to be Lexan. I did a lot of research for the proper desired size. I don't recall expecting such a huge interior that is large enough for a 9x13 inch baking dish that won't touch the walls of the microwave. One other thing, I found out from an appliance dealer that most of the microwaves are made by Panasonic now.  I mention it because I remember some remarking on the noise of the door catch. Yes, they are loud especially when one wants to be quiet without disturbing others. All the others I had, except for the original Whirlpool, which came with the house, which had a lever."
4,Love it other than the popping noise it makes.
4,Only thing i dislike (and this is my fault) is the wattage. Takes 2x as long as my old microwave - just be aware it is a low wattage microwave. Features are great and fair replacement for my full-sized microwave as it fits the space better.
2,"This microwave is one of the only ones that will fit in the small space available and not overload my wiring while still having digital controls. It's my second of this model - the first lasted for several years before rusting on the inside. The second has only lasted a month before the power button stopped working. Both models had faulty trays: the tray very easily comes off the tracks and will not rotate. It seems like that wouldn't be much of a problem, but it is hugely annoying! Not as annoying, though, as the power button not working. My next microwave will not be the same model."
5,"Bought this microwave for my shop office and I couldn't be happier. It fits on top of a filing cabinet at just the right height. Door is easy to open straightaway, there is no latch to pull like my last one which would move the whole unit around when opening or closing. Simple and efficient keys, 1 for 1 minute, 2 for 2 minutes, etc. Start button is also 30 second button or add 30 seconds button. It also has short cut buttons that are very usefel though I may not need them at work. My normal size lunch is heated in 1 1/2 minutes. Oh yeah, and the price can't be beat."
5,Smaller than i expected but is very powerful heats for in no time. A bit pricey.
1,"First of all the round plate that spins around when it's cooking does not stay in place well.Secondly, this microwave is so small you can't even cook a popcorn package in it without it stopping because the popcorn package hits the sides of the tiny area the plate is in and stops rotating.I definitely do not recommend this for anyone that likes microwave popcorn or wants to put anything bigger than a microwave popcorn pkg in it.We returned ours."
4,"As far as the microwave itself, it is fine. There are a few items that we do not like with this oven. If you use the timer, you cannot use the oven to heat/cook anything at the same time. Also, if the timer is used for any time under 10 minutes, you must first put a zero in or else the timer will be way off. Example: if you want to time something for 4 minutes and 30 seconds, if you forget the zero, the timer will read 43 minutes. They have an instant time of 1 through 6 minutes where you just push the one button, but if you need anything else, you have to first hit a ""time cook"" button. The beverage button is handy, but when I put a 10 oz.cup of coffee in and hit the button 2 times for 8 oz., the coffee is almost boiling. If I press the beverage button only once (for 4 oz. according to the book) it is almost the correct temperature. Would I recommend this oven? Yes... I just have to get used to the way this works.Update: This is a nice little oven. I gave it another star because it does work well. There are some quirks, as mentioned earlier, that I find a bit odd but all in all, I recommend this appliance."
5,"Regarding the ""Toshiba Microwave"" skill for Alexa...  The tutorial video tells you to add the Toshiba iMicrowave"" skill, but that's the wrong skill...  You have to add the ""Toshiba Microwave"" skill...  Otherwise, it tries to to link to a ""Toshiba Home AC Control"" account, which is not available in the USA.  The ""Toshiba Microwave"" Alexa skill will link to your ""MSmartHome"" account, which is created when you first setup your Toshiba microwave."
4,"As expected,  as good options, performs well!"
3,"it works like a microwave should ....  but despite the fact that it was in 3 layers of boxes and Styrofoam it arrived with the foam busted and dent ... i have a cabinet that is made for it.... so dent is not visible ... and so far the microwave works great ... but only had it for 2 days ... the dent is 1/2 inch deep along top, pushing out the side 1/2 and 3 inches long, but does not effect how the machine works ... they could do better on their packing choices .."
4,this is a great microwave it heats food better than my old microwave did.Update: I have using the microwave for a while now and I like how it heats there is one thing that is missing the light. Most microwaves have a light that come on either when you turn it one or open the door this microwave has no light. If I had know this I would have ordered a different model.
4,"After 4 times use of air fryers, it becomes so difficult to clean. The grease sticks permanently. The microwave works well. Now, I stopped using air fryers anymore."
5,"Our microwave of over 15 years finally went out.  And after the problems with supply chain issues, I found other brands, and smaller microwaves, that started at $600.  I began to search Amazon for a microwave, and low and behold found this Panasonic. It is amazing!  I love the reheat feature, I love the popcorn button with adjustable features.  I also defrosted 5 pounds of hamburger without cooking it in the same process.  The very center had a few frozen bits, but it still worked better than I thought it would.  As for reheating food, this device is intelligent!  It knows when your food is about done and sounds out a 30 second beep to let you know it's about done.  Now, I am telling you, if you let it go for the last full 30 seconds, your food will be HOT!I have discovered that I open the door (to stop the reheat process) at about 15 seconds, and our leftovers are perfect to serve and eat.Thank you to Panasonic to make this incredible microwave at an amazingly low cost!"
3,"It's smaller on the inside than I anticipated.  I was pretty sure it was the same dimensions as my last one. Who knows. Opening and shutting the door is crazy loud. The beeper is annoyingly loud and seems like it will never stop. It's not one long beep, it's a series of beeps. I saw some microwaves have a setting to adjust or turn off the beep. This one does not.  It works as intended, however, I must have missed the reviews on how loud and annoying these two things are because I would not have purchased it.  While it's running, it's quiet. I think when I move I will leave it here and get something else."
1,Almost impossible to use at first.  Buttons didn't always react. Poor design and hard to see.  Liked one button funchions.  Tech help  from Beliz was laughable.  Woman took most time getting  names and address.  Had to spell back each letter in my name (richard).  Phoned theee times in hopes it was salvagagble and only a power settting issue.  No such !  It is broken and needs to be replaced.  Our old Sears lasted for about 10 years.  Would not ever buy Toshiba agaiin.Worst designed  microwave is going to the junk yard on our dime!
3,"This microwave doesn't seem to heat up as well as the one I replaced.  The chrome trim also includes the release for the door button, so that part of the oven is always full of finger prints but the worst part is, the buttons that you push to set the thing are all crinkly like they were exposed to undo heat or not properly attached.  I have a feeling they will disintegrate completely in the not too distant future."
3,I wasn't expecting it to be so small a normal size plate can't hardly fit in there smh.However it does the job.
1,"I hate this microwave. I don’t believe in doing “full blown” cooking in it, just warming. It’s not a month old yet and it sparks. I pray it doesn’t start a fire!"
1,"It is clear that the once-famed Japanese ""continuous improvement"" approach has completely been lost at Panasonic.  Their cheap, junky latching mechanism first failed to open without pulling on the door, and then it failed to latch routinely without slamming the door -- and this was after 1 year of our 2007 Inverter microwave. We liked the microwave and kept using it for some 9 years.  Frustrating as it was.  But reliable.  It is in the garage and I think it still works...  Except for the hopelessly-designed latch.  So we bought this new large Panasonic.  After one year the damn junk latch design has failed to work properly again.  Panasonic obviously did nothing to improve the mechanism.  They should fire their useless product engineers who are meant to ensure good reliable products. I have tried WD40, tape, filing the latches.  Nothing helps.  The imbecile-designed latch fails to open properly and then fails to latch and the microwave will not start without it being thumped closed.  It will probably stagger on for years except for the likelihood that one morning I am going to pick all 50 lbs of this horrid frustrating piece of junk  up and drop it onto the first floor concrete from the second floor.  We all know about Chinese junk products.  Well, now we can add Japanese products into the junk product category.  It is a shame since Japanese products once actually had a reputation for being well-engineered.... No more."
4,Hope this gets to the right person.The turn table makes noise once you put anything on it. Cup of coffee and it makes a noise like something is to tight.Give me some direction please. I dont want to send it back if I don't have to.
1,Started making a buzzing noise after a week.  They are taking it back no problem though.
5,Works well for very small space!
5,Very nice product!!
3,"Works OK in general, but a few problems.Clock is wrong and seemingly can't be corrected - if I correct it manually, it automatically resets to the wrong time -looks like it does not take daylight savings into account. Google search results suggest that lots of people have encountered this problem, and none have been given a working solution.Setting the cook time is also a pain. The user interface was clearly designed by someone with little or no knowledge of the subject. The same button is used for setting the clock, as for setting the cook time - yet you have to press it TWICE to set the cook time, and only once to set the clock. Anyone with proper UI design experience knows that you make it easier to do the COMMON functions, than for the uncommon ones - and since setting the cook time is done a LOT more often than changing the clock time, clearly the cook time ought to be activated by one press, and the clock setting activated by two presses. Simple concept, but seemingly beyond the capabilities of Toshiba."
3,Replaced a 20 year old Whirlpool.  This was a great choice.  Works great.
1,"The simplest thing of setting the time, according to the instructions was impossible. When the clock button is pressed non of the numbers I would function at all. Some of the other functions I tried it takes a tremendous amount of pressure to make them operate. This one is heading to goodwill and let someoneElse deal with it"
1,"Plugged it in, doesn't work. Tried three outlets. Dead as a doornail. Also, it is tinny and the door wasn't lined up right and was attached so it extends about an eighth inch above the rest of it. Returning. DO NOT BUY."
2,"Good small microwave but it has a yank-the-handle design to open it. Since the unit is so small and light, the whole thing moves around the counter unless you use two hands--one to hold it in place and one to open it. If they'd put a push button opener on it everything would be fine, but this is just a really bad design."
5,"We ordered this when it was in sale; great sturdy microwave, easy to clean with sleek stainless steel exterior look, works well for our small family, no complaints after using for over two months!"
1,"Unfortunately the glass tray included is of very poor quality. A bowl touched the edge of the glass tray while taking it out and it caused a major chip, which is sharp and dangerous. I have never had a microwave do this before. Typically the glass outlives the microwave!"
5,"This  fit my parents needs for a small countertop microwave.  They have very little space. Is not very powerful and don’t fit a large plate but perfect to heat up leftovers for two and to earn up their drinks. I worried that the push buttons didn’t seem very sensitive but it didn’t bother them. Also, I had to put a space behind the microwave and the back wall or the microwave will move when you open the door."
5,"Easy to use, heats up fast and lightweight. Fits perfect on my kitchen counter without taking up alot of space."
1,After less than a year this product began to smoke internally while not even heating food correctly. Do not recommend
1,"Bought this to keep in my master closet for one purpose, to heat up my heating pad.  Every evening I put it in for 2 minutes. Microwave now gets very hot on the outside, whilst making horrible sounds, plate still turns but nothing inside gets warm. Lasted less than a year."
4,"I moved into a new place that came with a crappy microwave, so I started looking for a new one. I was on a tight budget, so I looked at a lot of fairly cheap microwaves during my hunt. This one seemed to be one of the best rated for a reasonable price. I was a little hesitant because there were many reviews about receiving faulty microwaves. Maybe I just got lucky, but I'm really happy with my purchase. It's a good size, and I haven't had any issues with how it heats food. My only complaint is that it is a bit loud, but that's something I'm willing to deal with at such a reasonable price."
2,Looks great!!! But the plate constantly falls off balance and has to be reset. Too small to cook a bag of popcorn without it not catching fire because it won’t spin. Can’t fit dinner plate without tipping it sideways to get inside. Frozen veggies take double the amount of time to cook. Will fit into tiny spaces for VERY basic use.
1,"I bought two (2) of these microwaves from Panasonic -- 2.2 cubic ft.  Both of them broke down with the same problems.  Totally unreliable.  Yes I purchased a third  microwave  BUT  not from Panasonic.  To be more helpful;  the two Panasonic Microwave Oven NN-SN936B microwaves had the identical problems:  they didn't die all at once, they stopped working in stages.  First, they would not reach the required cooking times.  After re-setting the cooking time, it came up short again.  finally, each microwave would start the timer without turning the revolving dish, and without heating -- all in two seconds.  I called in an electrician to check the electrical outlet and he confirmed it was a faulty microwave.  We even used different outlets with the same result.  Without hesitation, I would say that this Panasonic microwave has a computer chip / software problem.  I hope I explained the situation clearly so you can avoid the problems with this expensive product.  PS: the instruction booklet has NO customer service phone number to call."
4,"I got this microwave because I wanted something small to fit on my counter.  Very hard to find anything smaller than this and still maintain 900+ watt of power.  This would have worked great except for 2 reasons I didn't like it:1) the display was too dark to see the buttons and read the labels.  Would've have been nice if the print were white or perhaps black print on a white background.  This oven needs to be in a well-lite area to work the buttons.2)  The button to open the microwave door is the type you have to push to open.  Every time I push the button the microwave moves back.  My previous oven had a handle that I simply grab and pull open, which doesn't cause my oven to move away from me.Otherwise, it was a nice oven but didn't work for me."
2,Microwave is a good size but does not work. When I put something in and press start the time will run down like it’s heating up the food but the plate will not spin or heat up the food. I have to try to start it a few times before it works
4,I live in an apartment and it’s the perfect size.
1,"It never worked!!!!!Sent it back, got a good one from Walmart!!!!!"
2,"I liked this microwave until it started shooting out flames.  No, I didn't have anything metal in there.  I tried it with nothing in there after it happened, just to be sure it wasn't the peanut butter I was trying to melt, and it did it again.  I've had it only 1 1/2 years.  I'm just grateful I was in the kitchen when it happened; otherwise, my house could have caught on fire.  In any case, in the dumpster it went!  I'll never buy another Black and Decker product again."
3,"I thought It was low wattage when I bought It, amazon advertises 700 Watt, but in reality, It consume 1200 watt."
3,"My microwave died so I bought this. In the microwave’s defense, my old one was pretty awesome. This one does the trick but I hate the 30 second thing and how if you press 2, then it automatically starts at 2 minutes instead of giving you the option to add your desired seconds. Also, it attracts finger prints pretty badly. All in all, this microwave is nothing to write home about."
1,"This microwave started making some funny noises and heating unevenly at about seven months, and now is dead at nine months after purchase. I am now contacting customer support, but the chat support through Amazon can only help me with tools on the weekend, not household products. I had suspicions about buying a household product from a tool company, and sadly they are being confirmed. I will update this if I get good customer support."
4,I really dislike the fact that you have to push incredibly hard to enter numbers on the keypad.  It's so frustrating.  I can only hope that it will become easier with time.  I must say that it does cook evenly within the suggested timeframes.
5,Simple to use on first day
3,Seems to rattle a bit. Cooks beautifully.
4,"The microwave works just fine. Looks nice and matches all my appliances. It's pretty basic, nothing fancy or high tech about it. Very good for the price. I don't like some of the setting features but not a big deal."
1,The media could not be loaded.GARBAGE! Do not buy this! I was sent a microwave with a broken pieces straight out of the box. Retiring immediately for a refund.
4,"For best result with Pop Secret brand. Push Time Cook, press 2min. 10seconds. Press power level once. Will go to 9 automatically. Press start... BINGO. Using popcorn button just burned my popcorn. Just purchased this unit this year, because my sister has same model (bought last year) and her popcorn button works perfectly. I don't know if it's an electrical load issue in each home or because of a year difference in manufacturing. Whatever , I love my popcorn & so grateful to find a solution. Hope this may help someone."
2,So I set it up. Took a little bit to get it set up with Alexa. But after using it once. The microwave thinks the door is open and will not cook. I am not slamming it cause don’t want to mess it up. I tried holding the door closed and still will not go. Might have to send it back.
1,"Garbage, the dang thing almost caught on fire"
1,I disliked the fact that it wouldn't even start up so I could see if you cleaned dishes good or not
1,The media could not be loaded.ordered this last year 12-29-18. amazon shipped it 1-4-19. it most likely arrived 1-6-19.yesterday 1-6-20 (yes! exactly a day fromwhen it would have arrived here) the microwave began flashing lights when turned on and made crackling electrical sounds. i contacted their customer service who informed me that they will not be covering this item since the warranty has ended based on the purchase date (12-29-18) - i asked if they noticed that it was shipped 2-day shipping on 1-4-19 this would not have arrived in our hands until exactly a year from it was first setup... nothing. they will not do anything.if you are looking for a microwave that you will use less than a handful of times a week for a year and have it breakdown on you- this is your microwave! midea the customer service that covers this product (and a fee many others according to them) will not offer any assistance to rectify safety concerns on your appliance.want a mediocre microwave that might set your house on fire when your kid turns it on? get this microwavewant an appliance coverage that does not offer assistance to your appliance less than a year of you owning it? get items covered by midea
1,"Control panel is poorly designed, too difficult to use in the sense that it is not easy to find the correct spot where you press on each key. The spot where the keys should be pressed is not centered correctly and you have to press a little to the upper left and maybe you will be able to get it to work, plus those spots are very small so it is very easy to make mistakes. And to boot, the most important key is the one that sets the cooking time up, and this key is not easy to find, it doesn't have the typical square of the common keys, but it is only a label where you assume that there is something to press.  Needless to say my mother who is 80 years old, was extremely angry at such design.Obviously I returned the oven."
4,It is a decent microwave. Good for its size and price. With small ones you don't get to heat up as much. I notice ut do was s smoke a little but I don't mind it.
4,"We bought this microwave knowing that it would be temporary and for a smaller space, so we didn't want to get the top of the line.  It worked well for the price.  I gave it 4 stars because the ""cancel"" button (to clear a few seconds remaining from the last heat up) is in the middle of the buttons, which did not seem logical and frustrated both my husband and me."
4,Very nice item.
2,"I just wanted a microwave for quick heating of food.  This does that job well enough.  The rotating plate dislocates constantly, and i have to reorient much more often than makes sense.  The inside is black instead of white which makes it harder to spot stains."
1,"Product arrived in a well packaged box, no dents, etc.  Looked beautiful, heavy duty, rugged.  However, the turntable did not turn!  You'd think they would check the microwave before sending it out.  Obviously Toshiba did not do this.  As it's such a heavy item, Amazon refunded me the money for the microwave, but told me to give it to charity or to the dump.  Hope Good Will will take it despite the defect, taking to the dump will be a pain and will most likely cost money.  Wish Amazon allowed me to return to UPS but they didn't.  So I definitely would NOT recommend this microwave, despite the excellent reviews!"
4,"Arrived safely packed, no damage.  Not sure why it requires 2 boxes when the landfill is filled but...will update after we've used for a few weeks."
2,"Very easy to use, but much louder than my previous unit.The light does not turn off if the microwave is not in use and the door is opened (it did on my previous unit).  It's useful to be able to leave the door open after use to air the inside.  (I'm comparing to my previous unit which was the same basic unit, no fancy bells and whistles, 20 years old when it died on me.)  Seems someone decided to change the design?"
4,"Purchased as a housewarming gift and it’s perfect! Works great, looks great. Affordable and easy to use. Very happy."
3,IT CONSTANTLY BEEPS..
2,"I love how quiet it is, practically no noise at all. It is not easy to program the time other than full minutes, but, is ok.The real problem is that there are no instructions on how to use the air fryer.Update: Still have no idea how to use the air fryer,"
5,Right size
4,"Yeah, it nukes things up well enough but it could be better.  Specifically, the latch mechanism sticks.  The unlatch button does its job well enough but the door latching mechanism doesn't pop the door open despite the button's being fully depressed.  I have to pull the door open from there.  It's not a big deal but it is a pain considering how simple opening the door is supposed to be.My unit suffered a ""control board"" failure that rendered it unusable.  Luckily, it was still under warranty - but just barely.  So, I brought it in to the nearby Panasonic approved repair vendor and they slotted in a new control board.  They greased the door latch mechanism as well but that did absolutely no good and made no difference.The unit still nukes things well enough.  And as a basic home microwave that gets used multiple times a day, that's good enough.I'd prefer some better features - like the timer's chime ceasing once the door gets popped open, but that's a quibble of a minor nature.When I buy my next nuke I better know what I'll be looking for and it won't be a repeat of this model as a result."
3,"When this runs it is very loud- very loud fan.  Also beeps are really loud.Touch pad buttons not sensitive and you have to push them hard and microwave is light so when you push the buttons, machine tends to move.  Controls not that intuitive but not that complicated.  I don’t hate it and I guess I’ll get used to it but I am already annoyed."
1,"This was a bad experience from the get-go. I originally ordered a model that was not Alexa-compliant because, yo, I don't use Alexa. Got the Alexa-compliant anyway. I set it up and put in a mug of coffee to reheat--nothing. I must have repositioned that mug a dozen times, but the oven would not operate. When I contacted customer service, the response was pretty hostile--they not only wanted the invoice, but a photograph of the serial number, a video of the problem, etc. etc. I walked away from that experience.Eventually I tried a microwavable bowl of oatmeal and the oven turned on! Whoo-hoo! It worked in terms of coming on if I pressed the start button. But forget about programming this thing by hand. It's more like a Sudoku than the short, logical inputs of other microwaves I have used.Then I put in a mug of coffee and again the oven wouldn't come on.I don't actually know what the issue is with this thing, but my guess is there's an overamped safety feature that is not ""seeing"" ordinary kitchenware and therefore will not allow the oven to operate without divine intervention. I often--but not always!--have to put in extra containers of water to get a response. I often--but not always!--have to place the containers off-center on the carousel. I never know what it's going to take to convince this thing to heat food.Needless to add, I don't recommend this microwave to anyone. Neither the product nor the service experience came anywhere close to meeting my most basic expectations."
3,"This was for my semi truck. The description said it was 17 inches long, and that is why I bought this one, it was the only one under 18 inches. I have a space that is 17 and 3 eighths wide and now I measure this and it is 17 and 5 eighths wide. Dont help me any for the space I have. Wish they would have gave the correct measurements!!!"
1,"This microwave is garbage. The labels on the front of the unit are worn off and it sounds off at random after using, clearly on it's way out after 3 months. I've had microwaves last for years but this one needs to be avoided. You'd be much better off buying one for $50.00 at the ""W"" box store. Much more reliable."
4,"The dimensions inside/outside are exactly the same as a model we bought years ago. (The only reason for replacing the older one is after my spouse overcooked pop corn and heavily scrubbed the inside multiple times to rid the cavity of the smell, some of the painted finish had worn away.  Eventually the smell dissipated, and I replaced the mica protector over the wave guide.)  A physical spacer keeps the unit over an inch away from the ventilation holes in back. See images. Note those holes are recessed at about 14"" as measured from the front - the holes are not flush with the back - there's better draw this way - its a feature I like.*** March 1, 2020:  I've discovered this model has been quietly improved over it's original version from 2016. I base this on an Amazon review I noticed today: dated January 4, 2016, in which 12 pre-sets were available. Mine has more, see below. Why this is important, some of the faults described in earlier reviews may have been fixed. See the comparison below with the changes I noted from a similar model bought in 2015.  I continue to be quite happy with my purchase. ***With minor changes, operating instructions are almost exactly the same as the older model.  Change 1: 14 custom-programable cooking pre-sets (from oatmeal to fish fillets) instead of 12; Change 2: quick time boosts of 30 seconds a push instead of 60 seconds; Change 3: More clearly marked buttons to increase (More) or reduce (Less) sensor cooking by 10 or 20 seconds, per your personal preference after getting experience with the defaults; Change 4:  The buttons are more sensitive - they easily register your touch. Using the STOP button yields a long beep, distinguishable from the automatic beeps at the end, by default. Change 5: For English speakers, the user manual is laid out better, clearer.The model uses ventilation from the back (intake) and the right side (cross-ventilation output). See images. The draw for this 1200W oven (output) is 1480W from the power source (Panasonic documentation). The inverter technology means full power is applied only as the default (power level: 10).  For instance for 1100 watt recipes, I can get almost the same effect by tapping the power level from P10 to P9, and twice more for 800 watt recipes (P=7). These settings reduce -constant- power by 10% (about 120W) per tap after the first one. Not all microwaves provide this steady reduced power, but I rejected considering products using the intermittent technique (eg 70% of the time at full power, 30% at none).CONS: (A) The 3 built-in sizes for popcorn bags are too big for the 1.25 oz size we get.  I'm surprised that after 5 years, this very common size was ignored by Panasonic.  (B) For Spanish speakers: Warnings, care (foods, containers), and installation notes are in Spanish, but the majority of user instructions is stated in English only. Las advertencias, el cuidado (alimentos, contenedores) y las notas de instalación están en español, pero la mayoría de las instrucciones de usuario se indican únicamente en inglés. [cortesty un traductor automático]* purchased 5 years ago, model nn-SN661S. There's no serious learning curve from that model to this, ... and it uses the same spacing/ventilation requirements!This review is subject to update based on experience, but I do not anticipate the need."
5,"Easy to use, pre set timer, light weight, quite, LED light inside, fast heating oven"
3,"This seems like a standard microwave, but with a lot of different settings, which is convenient.  I got the .9 cu. Ft. one, and it accommodates the size of my regular dinner plates, so I was pleased about that.The cons:The reason I’m deducting one of the stars is because the print (on the microwave) of the numbers and settings is MUCH too small.  I need to put my reading glasses on to make sure I’m pressing the correct button.  That might not be a problem for everyone though.The reason I’m deducting a second star is because when I try to pull open the door by the handle, the microwave slides across the counter with it, so I need both hands to open it.  I’m not pleased about that."
2,Toasts unevenly. Back to reheating in the iven
2,We like everything about this microwave except the very loud buzzing noise.  I guess we'll see how long it lasts!
2,Did not come in same color as advertised.  The rotating plate runs off track too easily as well.
2,"We moved from a house with a built-in microwave to one without. We needed a small countertop microwave for things like melting butter and reheating leftovers. Maybe it's unfair to compare this microwave to a built-in, but it takes three times as long to heat something. We are also having an occasional problem with ours where it will kind of freak out when you try to input time, and it makes the beep tone and won't stop. Pressing keys doesn't do anything. Unplugging it helps, until the next time it happens. We've only had it about six weeks, which seems to be par for the course with mass produced, made in China electronics."
3,burns even with rotation.  stop 1/2 way and shift on table.  helps.
3,"Bought this microwave for my Mother.  Unpacked it and found it was dented.  Amazon sent me a replacement which seems fine.  My 95 yr old Mother finds it easy to use.  A little noisy, but not as bad as some."
3,There is a screw that is missing from the door that prevents the door from aligning properly when you are trying to close it.  Great for small spaces.  Works perfectly as advertised otherwise.
5,Works well. Dimensions were correct. Plug in and go. Thank you
5,"I did quite a bit of research on small microwaves before buying and I am super happy with this purchase.  It's small in form, but you can fit a full sized dinner plate in there!  Very nice looking for the price, as well."
1,"Incredibly dangerous!?!? Just bought it a few days ago. Third time using it, we heard a loud grinding like a motor.Went into the room where we were heating up baby’s oatmeal and it was rapidly filling with smoke! Whole house filled with smoke. Smelled like burning plastic.Very thankful we were in the next room and heard it or it could have burned the whole house down!"
4,"Nice looking microwave with ample power. One thing I would improve upon is the menu, specifically adding one touch menu buttons. Inverter option is plus."
5,I'm 75 years old. This is Great for frozen. Meals.
5,"The media could not be loaded.I had never heard of the Chefman brand before this purchase. I am very impressed so far.I replaced my old LG microwave with this one. The LED numbers on the LG started going out at about a year old.This 1.3 cubic foot was the perfect size for my wire rack. I have nothing but good things to say about this Chefman microwave. It heats evenly and quickly. The feature that you can program it to cook for the desired time at 50% power and then have it keep cooking for the next desired time at full power without having to stand there with it is great.I also love that you can turn off the beeps for the buttons and the end of cooking.This thing is so quiet that I don't even hear it running unless I am standing next to it. Check out my video, I did nothing to mute the volume.The controls are simple, and the interior is roomy enough for my largest dishes.I highly recommend the Chefman microwave."
3,"This microwave does not heat well and it's on Power 10. All I've tried in the 2 weeks I've owned it is simple small frozen tv dinners. If the box instructions say cook for 4mins, this requires 6. I looked frozen tv dinnet spaghetti small plate with instruction to cook 6.5 minutes when I checked it at 7mins it was still cold to the touch so I cooked it for 2 more minutes. Not sure if it will get better with use. Also I purchased because it said it had a handle to open. There is no handle, it's a button to press then you have to hold door or it snaps wide open."
2,"I like how this microwave looks on my counter, and it does a good job of heating evenly, the settings are pretty easy to figure out and use. BUT, after having it for a few months, the light started to flicker at times. Kept getting worse and worse, until yesterday, when I actually saw whisps of smoke coming from the area of the light. The microwave itself seems to still work, but the light is now permanently burned out, and I'm a bit nervous to use the oven now that I saw that smoke coming from the light. I looked up how to change the bulb before that even happened, and discovered that there's no way to replace just the bulb, because it's a whole lighting unit you have to replace. That part is hard to find, and costs at least $25-30 and requires wiring it in. This seems to be a common problem with these.  I've had it for less than 2 years."
4,For the price not bad.  I paid $90 in 2018 for this microwave.  It heats things well and is realtivly easy to clean.The paint around the front of the door is starting to flake off.
5,Es grande y calienta rapido
4,"I have only used my beautiful microwave twice so far and have been very happy with it, although the dinner plate setting is not accurate as you have to use it twice to heat up a cold meal. However, I have never found a microwave that does that efficiently. I was pleased with the fact that it was small enough to fit in my tight space and still leave room at the sides for air. One thing, and one thing only, that bothers me and that is the inside is very dark gray so I think it will be impossible to get really clean from spills. Otherwise, a great little microwave for the money."
4,Works well for a small microwave
3,I'm really confused about why the keypad in French.
3,"Delivered with box crushed (and retaped with “Amazon” tape). Big concern is when lifting out of box I could feel lots of oil leaked from underneath. Concerning and toxic smelling. I did a 1-minute test with a cup of water and it seems to function fine. But does anyone know if the oil which has obviously dislodged from internal workings is cause for returning it? Other than this concern and if it is “broken”, microwave is beautiful color (deep red front, black elsewhere); good medium/large size; and has features I want."
1,This microwave is terrible. It doesn't heat evenly and often leaves my food cold in the middle. The buttons are difficult to press (digital) and the display is not user-friendly. Disappointed and do not recommend.
3,"Buyers remorse.  Should have read the one star reviews .. have had a fire event in my house and don’t need another,  Every item made today has some level of bad reviews.  Brand names mean nothing.  My  ancient Emerson  is back in its old place .. nothing today is made to last any reasonable time.  Holding my breath on my 13 year old Kenmore Fridge ..when Kenmore used to mean something.Purchased this smaller size to fit a space now occupied by an early 80’s basic Emerson microwave which still works but may die down the road.  People who think digital is more efficient and easier to use have not had the joys of a mechanical device,My old Emerson has three steps.  A mechanical toggle switching between cook and defrost,  A mechanical dial for the timer which requires only ONE motion unlike digital which often requires multiple stabbing to get where you want to go.And a on/off switch you just push which after over three decades does stick a bit.  Still turns off when the door is opened to check done ness  but engages when shutting the door instead of just pushing start again.This new item has a long list of power levels going up in 10% increments with absolutely no correlation to any function requiring such precise numbers, .. older microwaves often had Low, Medium or High settings which is infinitely easier.  But precise wattage ala a regular oven ?  Really?The “easy” presets for more commonly used foods or beverages belies the fact that they require very specific volume or weight for each setting listed.  That means you must take time to PREP to make sure your amount matches the settings.  More wasted time.  I have a lot of mugs and  many are hand crafted stoneware ..so they vary a bit with exactly how much liquid they hold.  So I have to vet them all and designate which I can use on a preset?The instructions wisely say to monitor the device when in use so why have to fuss with presets?  Just nuke it and test for doneness. As you would with any oven ..if it needs more time then do that.People are so enamored of digital …I used a two slice toaster once with a touch pad.  Earrings on a pig Instead of a one motion mechanical dial to set toasting level. You had to stab at the touch pad ..even more annoying when you out the next two slices in you had to Re Set the toasting level because the device has no memory you can lock in.  So a lot more effort to get what should be a simple result.My microwave needs are pretty basic and I guess I will eventually figure out what I won’t use on this new one… but, for now, I am in no hurry to do so."
1,"I didn't love this microwave while it worked (loud rattle, uneven heating),  but I'm pissed that it is now not usable less than a year of very moderate use. The light started flickering about 3 weeks ago, I tried to find a new bulb to no avail, figured it wasn't a big deal, kitchen is bright I will live. Then tonight when I open the microwave after heating something for less than 2 minutes, smoke is pouring out of the grate in front of the light. Unplugged it immediately and will not use again. Granted this was less than $100, but given it was used very moderately (maybe 30 min total a week) I am pissed that I have to replace this hunk of junk and also will have to pay to have it properly disposed of. Will not buy Toshiba appliance again."
2,"Have had this microwave for less than a year and am getting H98 sign when I try to  use it,  Support at Panasonic is pretty much not there as you have to go through all sorts of hoops to get to a person.  I live in the country and am not anywhere near a repair service so to try to get it repaired is a major drive to the nearest city."
3,The microwave door is too small to handle. The purchase price was too expensive compared to the other brands; similar items. .
3,"My only problem with this product is it builds moisture inside the microwave in a way I've never seen before. After cooking something,the inside is very wet, and sometimes drips in food."
1,"Hard to find microwaves *in stock* that fit in the one space my kitchen can accommodate a microwave. My 25 year-old Emerson just stopped running one day two weeks ago. The only Emerson I can find now is too large.  I've been looking EVERYWHERE on and off ever since. Settled on this Toshiba on Amazon simply because life is too short to spend any more time looking for a microwave. It fit the counter, the budget, and my microwave needs. Sadly, it's got to go back. I'll start with the positive first.Pros:-Arrived when expected with Prime.-Decent price.-Matte black is kind of sleek and works with other appliances. Not shiny, not jet black.-Not too loud.-Heated the mug of water in my test quickly.-The handle does open easily. No movement when pulling on the door, but I only used it once!Cons:-The steam from the heated water in my test leaked out of the top of the door! I got a bad one. The door is not sealed or not installed correctly. But if steam can escape, guess what else can! I considered just exchanging for another one, but...----There is no Start or Stop button. The only way to stop the cycle is to open the door as far as I can tell. That doesn't seem right to me.----The key pad doesn't respond on first push. I had to really press the option I wanted (Beverage).  I don't think the key pad will hold up very long.-----The keypad is *not* easy to see in the corner of my kitchen. It's very dark.I'm going with a simply Black and Decker for half the price that is in stock at two stores near me and I can pick up tomorrow. I don't want to live without a microwave any more, and I certainly don't want to spend any more time looking for one."
5,"Just sold my home and moved to an apartment with very limited space.  Getting a microwave was a big decision.  Wanted something that could fit anything so that I could quickly reheat a meal.  This is a great option!  You’ve got plenty of space,  interface is intuitive and easy to use,  and the finish is very nice.  Looks great, works better!"
4,"We finally had to replace our 20+ year old microwave. We settled on this one because of the positive reviews. After 5 months of ownership, we are settling into some new operational features. The only drawback thus far, in our opinion, is that the interior light does not illuminate the interior very well. Otherwise, it is a good value for the purchase price."
5,My New Panasonic Microwave Oven was Easy to set up and Large Print User Manual was Easy to zzzzzzzzread and made It easy to configure and use right out of the box. I Recomed it.
1,"I purchased on Janury 13, 2011 and it has stopped working as of today, April 17, 2011.  The microwave has stopped heating.  I am very displeased with this product and would not recommend it to anyone.  I buy a lot of products from Amazon, and I am very displeased about this.  I would not even give this any rating.  I am completely dissatisfied.  This is the RCA 0.9 Cubic-Foot Microwave Oven model RMW953."
4,Used  in my Guest House
1,"I'd give it 0 stars but that isn't an option! When we had trouble setting the clock on our new microwave it became apparent something was not correct. After reading the manual, researching online and spending over an our on the phone with TOSHIBA it turns out that the microwave we received from AMAZON was NOT the model or microwave advertised in fact it's NOT even a microwave that Toshiba makes... the picture of the display (picture on left) that is on the AMAZON website is the correct display for the model they are claiming they sell, but when it arrives the microwave display actually looked like the picture shown on the right and is NOT the correct display for the MODEL - ML-EM45P(BS). After getting a replacement and having the same issue we called for a refund and it took 3 representatives to agree to give us an immediate refund the others wanted us to wait until they have the effective microwaves back. DO NOT BUY.... THIS IS COUNTERFEIT and DEFECTIVE"
5,"Great value - read the manual, or you will never figure out how it works."
3,"I have a problem getting it to work on convection.I've followed the instructions to start convection, by hitting convection, then the temp, then the book says to hit start twice to preheat, which it does. After it preheats, it beeps twice and the temp flashes.Book says to open door put food in and put in time. It will not let me put time in, number buttons do nothing door open or closed. everything else works fine, I would like to return it but I don't have the packaging it came in."
5,BEYOND INCREDIBLE!!👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾🔥🔥🔥
3,Takes too long to do its job
2,"Can't review microwave yet. Just picked it up yesterday. They sent it USPS who would not deliver, as it's too heavy. I had to go to the post office and pick it up. Why would you send it that way?"
5,I gave it as a gift to a company. Overall they seem very happy with the product
1,"After wrangling this bulky box inside my porch, where it was left overnight after delivery, and removing all the packaging, I discovered a large dent on one corner. I had to return it."
4,Pretty decent and has been in daily use in the office.  The 0.7 are quite small though and some dinner plates seem like they wouldn't fit in it.
4,"I like the microwave. However, the instructions leave a lot to be desired."
1,It work for about 2 months and then started making a banging noise and the turntable was getting stuck and not turning. Also the power levels are a joke. Instead of doing less power it goes on high for less time and then shuts off and then turns on high again. Melts butter instead of softening it.
5,This microwave is easy to use! It’s indeed a plus in the kitchen!
3,The microwave is small which is why I bought it however it has very minimal power. Biggest con is after only one month of use the start button is majorly chipping and peeling and the stop button is next. I’d look elsewhere.
2,"I wanted to replace a 0.9 cu.ft microwave oven which has a 12"" plate and if you measure the inside and do the math, comes out to 0.895 cu.ft. The Toshiba ML2-EM09PA(BS) Microwave Oven has a 10"" plate and is considerably smaller. I forgot to measure the inside before returning but it is smaller. Also the picture shows a black interior with many holes. The one I received had a white interior with few holes."
3,"Liked the size and features but when you use the air fryer, my smoke alarm goes off because it overheats."
1,"I purchased this microwave and used it the 1st day to heat my dinner plate.  It worked, although it seemed it wasn't heated all the way through at about 1:30 in the microwave. I thought nothing of it and the next night I put it in for 1:45 thinking it would heat all the way through.  However to my surprise, it did not heat the food at all!  It turned on and powered up 'like it was heating' however, nothing!  I tried several things, including a hard resent of the microwave plus a few other things I found online for this brand microwave.  Keep in mind this was purchased new.  I ended up requesting a return through Amazon and they are having UPS pick it up Monday.  Not buying a Farberware microwave again!"
5,I do not wish to leave a negative review but when I opened the box to my microwave today  the glass plate was smashed to smithereens! I'd really like to keep the microwave though  I haven't even taken it out of the box yet. Is it possible to get a replacement  glass plate for the microwave? I would even be glad to purchase a plate.
2,"Do not buy, catches on fire when I had siracha on edamame and when I put a few jalapeños in it, 2 separate occasions.  I cant believe this hasn’t been recalled."
5,"Our over the range microwave broke and while waiting on a repair person we needed a temporary solution. This solved that problem great. It is pretty small, and doesn't fit things our OTR microwave does, but it heats up just as well. It looks good too with a black / stainless combo and matched the kitchen and other appliances nicely. I will say it's pretty light weight, so pushing the door open button ends up pushing the entire microwave back on the counter so you have to kind of hold it while you press the open button. In the photo I posted you can see the microwave size compared to a toaster and coffee grinder. It doesn't have much of a ""frame"" so its footprint is compact."
2,"I needed to replace an older microwave whose inside paint job had corroded beyond help.  I wanted something inexpensive but of dependable quality and was surprised to see this Toshiba.  First let me say that the controls work in a standard manner so the learning curve is low.  The problem is that the display face is so dark it takes a flashlight to read it.  They couldn't have come up with a backlight or something?  Also, beware of the Lock Door functionality.  Keep instructions near by for dealing with that.  The feet all were loosened and there is no way to tighten them, or really adjust them in case the surface is not level to the feet.  I would not say this product is disappointing.  The design just leaves much to be desired."
1,I need to return this item.  I think it is defective.  It has never worked correctly.  It makes loud noises and doesn't heat well.  Please contact me for a return.  Thank you.
3,Second order. First lasted 13 months;. Great when working.
5,Does it's job!  Mostly used to warm up foods. Haven't cooked anything in it yet.
4,Overall the best microwave we've had. Two reasons it didn't get 5 stars.1) The reflective tint on the door. Really makes it difficult to see what is going on in there. It looks nice from the outside but either needs a brighter bulb or a second bulb to shed more light on things.2) End of cycle beeps. Five very loud beeps. Seems like it wouldn't be too hard to make a volume adjustment for that. When I am getting ready for work at dark thirty in the AM and everyone else is sleeping I can hear it beep on the other side of the house through the bathroom door.Function and power are great. No lack of power. As a matter of fact we have had to reduce cooking time for everything we did in our old Breville.
2,"Microwave, listed as new, arrived dented on one side and scuffed on the face."
4,nice simple unit replacement
5,"This microwave/air fryer/ roaster, toaster, convection oven, warmer contraption is amazing! I've had it a year and still learning the many uses for it. I've condensed so many if my appliances."
5,Multi functions work as describedGreat price . Would buy again
1,You’ve got to be kidding me.Look the microwave isn’t terrible. But the clock is wrong. It’s wrong because Toshiba has an app that they won’t adjust to the correct time zone.Toshiba’s customer support is useless and vacillates between lying to customers (“we will have someone get back to you about this”) and ignoring them (they never have anyone get back to us about it).I’m hoping that they see this review and reach out to me. There are many people with broken microwave clocks asking for support and Toshiba just ignores us.[As an aside; we’ve tried unplugging the microwave and disconnecting the app and the Wi-Fi and it still hasn’t fixed the issue]
1,"Well, it serves its purpose. It is a little noisy (I'll get to that) but the microwave arrived with a scratched door....which is partly why I'm not thrilled about it. When we first turned it on, the zapping noise it made convinced us it would catch fire. It didn't....but everytime it starts running, it makes a very loud zapping noise. We're still sans fire....but do not waste your money on this microwave"
4,User friendly. Would have given 5 stars but for the control panel. It's not backlit and difficult to see.
3,"This microwave replaced a well-used, much-appreciated Panasonic model that finally gave out. It cooks well and we like its smallish size and that the beeping can be eliminated, but I find myself aggravated with the controls every day, for a few reasons: Most important, the buttons are touch-sensitive rather than mechanical, and one or more have be pressed more than once to register a ""press"" nearly every time I use it. Others in the family also have this problem. Oddly, sometime it seems you have to press the reset button to get the controls to work, even when the previous cooking cycle was completed. Finally, the buttons are not backlit and the light colored labels don't stand out well against the dark background, so the controls can be difficult to see well if the lighting isn't bright.I seriously find these everyday aggravating annoying enough that I regret buying this microwave, which we are considering replacing and donating to a good cause. It's a shame that the product design folks at Panasonic ruined what is otherwise a great product with these aggravating controls."
5,I had a red microwave for 11yearsUntil it died.a Emerson red and black.This new General Electric is way bigger.With more features and more power than my old Emerson.My 3n1 packs more features. The only thing I didn’t like was.that it looked bent at the bottom under the lock release.Great oven .I love it
2,"5 stars on microwave but 2 for the handle. Very hard to open, definitely need two hands otherwise you would pull it right off the counter. I like to heat my coffee and have to be careful not to fill it all the way because it spill when I try to pry the door open. I thought maybe the latch would loosen over time but its been 3 months and no change."
1,"The first microwave arrived with damage that went through the back to the inside. I sent it back and ordered a new one. The second one also arrived damaged through the back panel, this time apparently from the inside."
2,This microwave was smaller than I expected. I measured the space and bought the size I thought was closest but it is too small.  It holds a coffee cup. Doesn’t hold my  microwave popcorn maker.My real problem is the device constantly smells burnt. I have washed it out several times and it still always has a burnt smell.I think I will soon buy a different model that better meets my needs.
4,"I love this microwave - although it is a little nosier than my last one, but I can live with that, because the price is just right.  I would recommend this microwave to others.  It is a nice microwave and very easy to use."
5,al parecer esta trabajando muy bien gracias
4,The push button door opener is a little stiff and hard to open and close.  Also when you open or close the door the microwave slides backwards or tilts forward.  You also almost slam the door to close it.  Other wise a great microwave for small spaces but powerful!!!
1,"Right out of the box, food upon defrost are unevenly heated following directions to the letter.  Additionally, turnstile gear is louder than all of the appliances in the kitchen while running.  It sounds like rusty gears turning under the microwave.  A piece of junk - spend more money on a quality microwave of the same dimensions.  Initially, the 1.2 cu ft 1100 Watts was a draw.  Don't be fooled.  It is cheap and annoying waste of money.  The 18 year old and stylish Kenmore of the same dimensions replaced was far superior."
4,"I use this microwave in everyday warming, and it consistently cooks the food throughout.  No hot or cold spots.  It is pretty durable for my family of five, and fit perfectly in the same spot as the old one."
3,"My rating is due to the door, it is hard to open,  I have to hold the microwave  so it does not move."
3,"I got this because of the Inverter Technology which happened to be useless. There is no difference between the power levels. Otherwise this is good quality microwave. The first unit was faulty - would shut down, but Amazon was very helpful and offered a replacement. Panasonic on the other hand, offered to fix it (did not offer even a temporary replacement), and I had to pay for shipping."
4,"Box was damaged when it arrived (photo attached), but I found no damage to the microwave itself. However, the little gray three-pronged piece that makes the turntable turn was not secured anywhere and fell out on the floor when I opened the box. Thankfully, it fell on my floor and not out of the box before I received it. I needed a smaller microwave to fit in the space specifically designed for my previous Kenmore, which I loved. It's taking a little getting used to the lower wattage and the smaller interior of this unit. It is very lightweight, and the buttons are hard to push, so I have to hold it in place when the buttons are pushed, or it slips and slides around. The door flings open at a good speed, so I've learned not to be holding something in front of it, ready to place inside, when I open the door. Other than that, it is a nice-looking microwave and does the job. P.S. I don't use Alexa, so that feature, if it has it, is of no use to me."
4,"Some features that I like were missing from this Microwave. It also burned some food, because I followed package directions, even though I reduced the cook time."
1,"Dented in on one side, the plastic spinning where circle is also broken. Poor quality."
5,"I don't do full meals: hot water, single servings, oatmeal, etc. and it is fine for that. Wouldn't recommend for multiple servings at once or for meat, other than maybe a couple strips of bacon.  Works fine for what I need and gives me twice as much counter space which was what I wanted. Easy to clean. would buy again."
1,"Don’t Recommend!! It doesn’t heat up, Takes twice as long as a normal microwave should."
5,"[UPDATE at end]  I've owned many microwaves, was the first person I know to buy one, in 1974.  People use to come over to try it, a modern marvel.  And wonder of wonders, this is the only other microwave since that original one (a Gaffers and Sattler) that explains in the manual how to make creative use of aluminum foil in the microwave!  I didn't know you could still do that.  The purchase was worth it for that knowledge alone (I was an old hand at using foil- on the wings of chickens, with rolls, bread, things that cook too quickly compared to other parts of the meal).  No scrimping on the packaging- it arrived in a heavy-weight box within a box and encased in styrofoam, so no chance of dents or damage, yet easy to unpack.Aesthetically I LOVE this.  I fancy it has a chunky retro mid-century look to it, like what a food replicator looked like on the original Enterprise.  I don't have the best eyesight and the buttons are big and clearly labeled- can see them without my glasses.  Ditto with the digital display, bright green; the light inside is bright too.  The handle is thick and solid in your hand, pleases me every time I use it (haven't had a microwave in years with an actual handle, SO much better, feels decisive, purposeful, kinesthetically pleasing).  The operation is intuitive (for the most part) and basic, well-thought-out, satisfying.  I'm coming from a fancy Panasonic unit with inverter technology that I was in love with, but as is apparently common with Panasonic microwaves it died after a few months.  It's a trade-off- I much prefer the look and operation of this (for example, the Panasonic had no number pad) but it takes slightly longer to cook, but that's okay.Being able to turn the sound off is a blessing.  I'm living in my vintage travel trailer at the moment and have two little finches that don't need to be awakened at all hours (they answer the beeps with chirps).  Relatedly the door makes a rather loud but not unpleasant thunk when closed normally, but it can also be closed gently, more quietly when desired- after a week it's already second nature to me.  The microwave when running is quieter than most.  Also wanted to say I nearly sent this back because the power level button didn't work.  What an idiot- when all else fails read the manual.  You change the power level AFTER you enter the cooking time.So far I love this thing, and like the many other Toshiba products I've owned over the years, hope it lasts a good long time.  (After my experience with the short-lived Panasonic I got the three-year warranty- a bargain at $6.)  But if it dies or malfunctions I'll update this review.  Thank-you Toshiba!UPDATE:  I had a senior moment and forgot to put the frozen lasagna in the microwave.  I manually set it for seven minutes and pressed start.  I was doing other things in the kitchen and about five minutes in the microwave went dead.  No display, no power, nothing.  It was HOT inside.  Oh great, I blew a fuse or WORSE, I thought.  I couldn't find the owner's manual.  I tried unplugging it, plugging it back in, nothing.  No re-set button on the back.  SO disgusted with myself.  Thought I was going to have to have it serviced or replaced.  About 15 minutes later it came back to life, after it cooled off, good as new.  Thank-you Toshiba!!"
3,"The media could not be loaded.UPDATE: I really like this air fryer, microwave, but it has a flaw. If food or grease gets splattered up on the air fryer heating unit at the top, it will start to smoke. I've even seen flames come out of that part. The problem is that they give you a metal piece to raise the food up so it's closer to the air fryer so it cooks better. But that also means it's easier for grease to splatter up on the heating unit and there is no way to clean it without taking the machine apart. They need a removable guard at the top that you can pull out and then clean any great off the heating tubes. Without that, there is the risk of fire. I'm still using it as a microwave and love it for that, but can't use it as an air fryer anymore. I even ordered a new unit to see if they fixed that and they didn't. So, buyer beware. Also, I called GE and their return policy is ridiculously difficult and time consuming. I'm keeping this to use as a microwave because it really is good but I got a different air fryer.Second update: I just keep finding things I love about this. I finally used it to defrost some meat and holy cow, it works perfectly! I usually don’t defrost meat this way because it ends up half cooked and half frozen, but if you take the time to figure out the weight of what you are defrosting, it comes out perfect. I’ve never had a microwave do this, especially with chicken. I just tried defrosting some chicken breasts and not one part of them came out white and rubbery. It was like I had just bought it — fresh and perfectly defrosted. I also tried a steak and it came out perfect as well. That alone makes this microwave getting.Also, I finally got my chicken wings to come out perfectly in this, using the air fryer. Since the heating element for that is at the top, I find if I always use the tall rack to cook things, they come out much better. For chicken wings, if you spritz them with some oil and then put them on the tall rack at 400 degrees for 25 minutes, take them out, coat them with sauce, and put them back in at 400 for 6 more minutes, they come out amazing! The skin is crispy and the sauce bakes in perfectly. When I put the sauce on, I flip them so the other side cooks as well. You can also flip them in the middle of the first round, but I just do it at the end. I don’t order out wings anymore because I can make them better and cheaper at home.Update: I attempted roasted veggies again using a dehydrator rack. The still take longer to cook but at least they weren’t soggy and oily when I was done. I’m okay with the extra cooking time because of how much space this will save me, but it would be nicer if future versions has a more powerful convention motor. I will say that this one is a lot quieter on air fryer mode than either my big air fryer/toaster oven or my InstantPot with the air fryer lid on. The air fryer mode is about the same noise level as the microwave. I will keep trying this method and I ordered a bigger rack to cook the veggies. If you search for round steaming racks you can find one that fits just over the crisper pan (10.5”).Initial review:I have been using an air fryer for years now and love them, but I don’t have a lot of counter space so I need appliances that do more than one thing. I was so excited to find this because it is multi-function and is smaller than the microwave I had. First impression is that it’s very sleek looking, which makes it easy to clean, and it was easy to use right away. I even set the clock!The microwave works the way any other microwave works. There is a glass plate that rotates to help cook the food more evenly and the controls were easy to figure out. I reheated some chicken curry and the bowl was hot while some of the food in it was still cold, so the same as my old microwave. The red silicone pad is mine and I like those because it makes cleanup easier and keeps dishes from sliding around.The air fryer mode is the one I’ll need to figure out more because it works but not as well as the air fryer I have. From what it looks like, there are heating elements on the top that come on when you use the air fryer mode so you can use metal pans in this when doing that. Basically, it’s a small convention oven and you can tell that the air is moving around because the whole unit heats up much more than it would during regular microwave use, and you can both hear the air and feel it coming out of the vents on the bottom of the unit. I do like that it doesn’t come out the sides because then I can store other things next to this.It comes with two metal racks to raise the food up higher to the heating elements — kind of like a broiler — and it comes with a “crisper” pan that you are supposed to use for air fry mode. The problem is that the crisper pan doesn’t have any holes on the bottom so the air doesn’t circulate all the way around the food. I tried roasting some veggies — my favorite thing to cook in an air fryer — and they came out a bit soggy because they ended up sitting in the olive oil instead of the excess dripping away like in a regular air fryer. Also, it took 50% longer to cook them to get them to char a bit around the edges. I’m going to experiment and use a small dehydrating rack I have and put the veggies on that with the crisper pan underneath to catch the oil and see if that works better because I really want this to work. I just wish they had included some better air fryer pans to use with this because you absolutely need holes on the bottom so the air can circulate. And they know this because when you use the air fry mode, the unit will remind you about 2/3 the way through to “TURN” your food, meaning you need to do this to get it to cook on all sides. Again, if there was a pan with holes in the bottom, this wouldn’t be necessary. If you look at every one of the bucket style air fryers, the bucket have holes and there is a bottom pan to catch the drippings. Letting the oils drip away is what makes it crispy and taste more Iike the food was deep fried.Cooking the veggies in the crisper pan just didn’t taste the same and they didn’t seem as healthy because there was more oil left on them than usual and they weren’t, ironically enough, crispy. The two photos I included show before and after 20 minutes at 375 degrees, which normally would have completely burned the broccoli in my other air fryer. I took the broccoli out and put the rest back in for another 10 minutes to get the last photo.One last thing is that you have to remember how hot the unit will be inside when you use the air fry mode. The panel will warn you of this when you open it up, but definitely keep potholders nearby because you will need them.I’m still happy with this unit and I think it has potential but I’ll have to keep experimenting to see if I can get it to cook things the way my air fryer does. I’ll post an update if I figure out how to do that. I am very happy that someone figured out how to combine a microwave with an air fryer because not everyone has a huge kitchen."
3,"The price was reasonable but we have had several disappointments with it.1  Within a month the START button wore out on the outside. It is usable but looks terrible. A check with the manual said they did not guarantee any plastic parts2,  It is very hard to use. Everything requires that we change the power button, OK we can do that BUT except for defrosting, the manual does not give times or settings,If we had know either of these things, we would not have purchased it."
5,"It was a gift to my daughter, she was satisfied with its power and availability to cook fast because my granddaughter is impatient for her food. It was an emergency!"
1,"I chose this Consumer Reports highly recommeded microwave because of their recommendation.  In fact, I linked from their site to Amazon.  The price was right, it was discounted.  And very heavy and bulky.  Also it lacks a manual for cooking specific foods.  Even online.  I got it set up expecting the BEST.  What I got was the WORST.  And scary to boot.  When heating a burrito, it often overcooked.  But was OK.  However, the big deal breaking moment was when I cooked 4 slices of Oscar Meyer bacon at 4 minutes, full power.  When I opened  the door, 2 pieces were black and dissolving in smoke.  1 piece was appropriately brown but tasted nothing like bacon, more like plastic. The 4th piece was somewhat blackened.  Then and there, I knew I needed a fire extinguisher and to return this defective item.Then, I went online to Consumer Reports and studied the buyer reviews of recommended microwaves.  Sorry to say, folks, many other recommended brands had serious problems.  What was an appliance that had previously lasted for years now seems to have a pattern of a very short lifespan adding to the overcrowded landfill and waste problem."
4,"This model was 1/4"" taller than the 10 year old microwave it was replacing. I held my breath trying to fit it in the space but thank goodness, it just fit and I mean ""just"". Phew! While it ticks the boxes for style, function, price, there's a Big but. It is so loud that it's disturbing. You actually stop talking until it's done. Fortunately, I was able to put the microwave in my pantry rather than right in the kitchen, and so the noise is slightly abated. If you're usigoing to be cooking for longer than a few minutes, I think you would want to leave the room."
5,"I liked the quickness it cooks the food. Love the color and design.I don’t like the fact you cant see inside the door window, I like to watch if anything is about to boil over. Oatmeal clean up is a pain.  I do not like the noise it makes during cooking or defrosting. It’s a bit annoying because it’s loud and it continuously  lowers its noise in between the cooking process then it picks up the noise again. This is throughout the whole time of cooking. Highs and lows. It’s too loud and quite bothersome."
3,It too bad costs have risen but quality has lessened
2,"I put a bag of microwave popcorn in and hit the popcorn button. I came back in literally two minutes, and the popcorn had burnt and was smoking. What had happened is when the popcorn bag unfolded and was now too big to rotate. The microwave is so small it cannot take a regular bag of popcorn. During the smoking there was damage. Now we are buying the larger microwave.I do think I made a mistake walking away, but I also think a microwave should be able to deal with a popcorn bag."
2,I like the size. The buttons are grey and very difficult to read. The plastic over the start button is already pealing.The instructions are not clear. I would not buy it again.
5,It uses less power but it cooks/heats like a 1100 watt  im very satisfied.
5,Perfect for a small area kitchen. Heats quickly and I wanted a carousel style. Very happy so far.
1,The media could not be loaded.I want a other one or my money back
4,Way smaller than I expected but a solid microwave
3,Came with no instructions on how to use the air fryer. One leg will not adjust to make stand level
2,The microwave itself works just fine but the keypad is dark and has no back light so you can't see the numbers unless you turn on a light in the room.
2,"Love the color, hate the noise when operating, dislike the noise of the tray rotating and the ease of it slipping off the track, but detest the smoke that pours out the door when removing the food after zapping."
2,"3 year impression - Microwave doesn't turn off. We have to leave it unplugged. On the search for a new one.First day impression - Heats food well and quickly, but the sound is so loud that it makes me wonder if it also doubles as a time machine. It's like getting an MRI. If that doesn't bother you, then go for it."
1,"Product arrived with no packaging besides an outer, torn box. More importantly, the 'start' button does nothing so the unit is not functional."
5,"This review was meant for the software provider for Toshiba, not the microwave. There were a couple of problems with the microwave staying connected to Alexa. This occurred after the software app did some updates. These problems were resolved and the oven works great with Alexa. Why voice control for a microwave? My 94 y/o mother is nearly blind. It works great for her. Also comes in handy for me when I’m cooking and am preoccupied with other cooking tasks. I simply ask Alexa to thaw, or warm at a lower power level, etc.The microwave itself is powerful and simple to use. I am very happy with this microwave. Whether you want Alexa integration or not, I highly recommend this Toshiba microwave.Alexa integration suddenly stopped working. When trying to control the Microwave, Alexa responds, “Toshiba Microwave oven is not responding”. Alexa control worked without problem for 3 months. Amazon, please see several recent reviews with this same problem dated 3/4/21. Coincidently, Alexa control stopped working around the same date that the MSmartLife app was updated. My mother is nearly blind and depends on the Alexa integration to operate the Microwave.PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE."
5,"Wish once you opened the door or hit stop, that the beeping would discontinue. It beeps 4 times no matter what, so a bit noisy but it works very well."
4,"Maybe it's will take me months but this time many weeks at least to get all the timers down. Complicated to use but I think in the long rung I'd change my rating and if allowed, I'll update this"
2,I  was a decent microwave that heated items well. I wouldn't say it was a very compact microwave and you would be able to fins a smaller unit for your space if needed. It was somewhat loud and I could hear it across the home. My issue is that it just stopped working one day and went completely black! For over $100 I would expect a microwave to last a few years and not just one. Will be buying a different make/model.
1,Very small and does not work like it should. Kept it but turn table is not sturdy.
2,This microwave is smaller than described and does not work with the linked trim kit.  All dimensions are smaller than listed.
3,"When in use, it's very LOUD!Other then that it's OK."
1,"I bought this as an emergency buy when my other microwave decided to die on me. Being the same wattage power,  I expected this to be a descent appliance. It literally takes 3 times LONGER to heat ANYTHING. A small cup of soup took me 3 minutes the other day. I have the power level maxed out too.  It's great for small spaces, but not worth the money in my opinion. It also seems to decrease in power after every item heated. So if you have multiple things to heat up, maybe consider the stove since It would probably be faster."
2,"Too lightweight. Slides just from pushing some of the buttons. The buttons should not require more than a light touch, but do require pressure. We replaced a generic Walmart unit of the same size with a more expensive and not as good unit. Skip it if money isn't an issue."
3,so far no problems
5,"I just replaced an old microwave I’ve had for years!!! And this one is so bright and well lit on the inside, quiet, easy to open. The other one I had was a push to open and had several annoying beeps when finished. This one has a pleasant one tone only. It says 1.3cubic feet, the other was 1.1. They seem almost the same size. Still works fine for me! Perfect size. Just received it a few days ago, so hopefully it last years as well."
2,I purchased this unit with the hope that I would no longer need to move my airfryer from the storage shelf to my countertop.  I will get right to the point.  The AirFryer simply doesn't work.  There is almost nothing in the printed instructions or on thier product webpage.  I contacted Toshibe customer support and NEVER heard a word back.  Save the $50 I wasted and buy the less expensive Micro/Convection model.There is NEVER a good excuse for BAD customer support.
1,Works but take longer to heat now as powerful as I thought it would be
1,"This product began sparking (a few weeks into our use of it) when warming butter to melt in a microwave safe dish. We stopped warming butter and the problem went away- or so we thought, it now sparks with any food (not liquid) even when covered by a microwave cover and even when on half power. The chamber that houses the microwave generator is black from the sparks and the microwave is unusable 3 months after purchase. I’m very disappointed and will pursue getting refunded for this product!"
4,"I love everything about this microwave, the look, goes with my other small appliances, easy to use, has a power adjustment. I hung on to my old one for 11 years, finally it gave out, I should have replaced it long ago."
2,"It cooks like youd expect but bot real quality  front scratched up, minute buttons faded quick"
4,"I'm sure this will be great but it comes with very little instructions for people who have never had an air fryer or the other features.  If anyone know how to get a booklet of instructions, please post.The one page I have instructs to use the ""beverage"" button to warm up a liquid but there is no beverage button.  I have not idea what ""combi"" is used for...."
1,Returned because handle arrived broken from the bottom screw. Returned it
4,"I'm comparing this new Farberware FMWO13AHTBKE microwave with my 3-year-old Amana microwave oven, Model AMC2166AS.I think the Farberware is a good buy at around $130; it does everything you want a microwave to do, with the possible exception of a convection cooking option. It comes with one-push button options for popcorn, potato, pizza, frozen veggies, beverage and dinner plate. I can attest that they all work well except ""dinner plate,"" but only because I've never used that.I usually use cooking or reheating times based on frozen package directions or my experience of what power level and how much time it takes to heat up, say, leftover pizza.  My wife likes to use convection, but it just confuses me on cooking times, so it doesn't bother me that this Farberware doesn't offer convection capability.Microwave ovens very widely in price, from $40 to as much as $5,000. The Farberware is a competent performer in the low-to-mid range.My older Amana microwave sold for $219 in 2013, which put it in a slightly higher category, so you'd expect it to do more than the Farberware, but the only significant differences I see is that the Amana can put out an impressive 1,200 watts of cooking power, while the Farberware tops out at 1,000 watts. Highly wattage generally means faster cooking times.The Amana is also slightly larger inside, 1.6 cubic feet compared to 1.3 cubic feet for the Farberware.But I think the Farberware model scores higher on appearance: it has a cooler, more modern look to it. The Amana runs a little quieter, and that's significant for me. I love quiet appliances like our Bosch dishwasher, and the Amana is very polite with its low noise, while the Farberware cooks a bit more loudly. They both have a five-bell ding when the food is ready, and you can't stop the five dings by opening the door, as you can with some other makes, notably an old Jenn-Air microwave we used to have.I originally planned to put the Farberware micro in a downstairs room that has a wet bar and conversation area because it would fill a space, look great atop the built-in mini-refrigerator and give us a non-kitchen option to heat up food. But the Farberware instructions say you must leave  a minimum of 10 inches of clear space ABOVE the microwave and at least 3 inches clearance between the oven and ANY adjacent walls. That kills my idea of a clean ""built-in"" look, so instead it sits atop a counter. You should know that in advance."
3,This not bad. Not worth $88.Definitely small microwave then normal ones. Better this then none though.
4,good product. they give you an extra display sticker for the buttons for when the writing wears off on the old one.  That was a plus
3,"The hum of the motor on this microwave is concerning, but after reading other reviews, i guess it's common. It's quite loud.  The loudness prompts my rating.  I do love the LED light inside that shows what is cooking.  It works well and fits in its space."
3,"The cover on the touch pad is de-laminating. The light has failed, the turntable is permanently scarred. The programming was counter-intuitive from the state.I love the concept of a microwave convection oven. But this one was just not robust enough. It's OK, but no prize-winner."
4,"Oven seems to function as of now, button selections are small"
2,"Digital clock stopped working nearly immediately. If there is time left on the microwave, I have to unplug it in order to clear it because the cancel button stopped working. Only reason I gave it two stars was because it heats my food pretty well."
2,cant get it to program tried everything  now the turn table wont turn around
1,"I received this microwave  a couple of days ago. When I tried to use it the third time, it just stopped working. I had only hoped it would last at least a year instead of a couple of days. It is a waste of my time and money! I'll have to return it and purchase a new one at Walmart."
4,"When it was time to replace our 8+ year-old microwave, we had lots to choose from.  This one is slightly bigger than what we had but much easier to operate...  From the nice door handle to one single push to heat feature, this mid-sized microwave is certainly a great value.  Highly recommended!"
3,"The microwave is a workhorse. Easy enough to clean, works reliably for 3 1/2 years, and then the light started blinking.Initially it only blink a little bit when it runs, then it started blinking more and more, eventually it becomes a strobe light when microwave is running and stay off when it is done cooking.As they use LED bulb, lightbulb is not something you can find easily find. LED bulb are supposed to last longer, but not in this case.I had to remove the bulb, and is now on a task to look for another microwave.Do not expect this microwave to serve a long time - it has part that will break and you can't find replacement of"
4,Smaller than I expected but still a good microwave
1,If i could give it zero stars I would. This microwave was the biggest waste of money. The casing gets dangerously hot when using and it doesn’t heat your food at all. It shouldn’t take 16 minutes to get barely lukewarm food! Will be returning this piece of junk asap.
3,"I purchased this in October 2021, it is April 2023, and last night white sparks, buzzing, electrical fire occurred when I tried to heat butter in a microwave safe Pyrex cup. It was very scarey and I pulled the plug immediately. I have melted chocolate, butter, in this Pyrex for years with no problem. The silver metal plate inside has a bumpy burned surface. This appliance is not safe, is one and one-half years old, and I would like a refund, please."
4,"The price is more than fair. This is a good quality microwave, rather spacious with an easy-to-use interface."
4,First off it seems to have been damaged in shipping. The box was busted and torn. There is a ding in the back corner. The outer cover seam to the microwave is popped up higher on one side. It took a minute to learn how to use the interface and to set the clock. However it is a very silent running microwave and works very very well. Just really very angry it showed up damaged.
3,power is not enough to properly pop a bag of popcorn
1,Very confusing to use. Sometimes mine smokes. Huge! Takes up a ton of space. Air fryer takes way longer than other ones I’ve used. It also makes a huge mess. The beeping is SOOOO annoying. It beeps every 10 seconds or so until you open the door. IT NEVER STOPS! You can turn the beeping off completely or have the most annoying beeping in the world. There is no in between.
5,"Wow, I didn't realize what a real piece of junk I've been using for the past 4 years until I received this microwave. I have another brand 700 watt that has seen better days. Next to it, my new microwave makes me feel like it might actually fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars. It's shiny, clean, it's all white inside, it's quiet (OMG, is it quiet compared to the 700 watt nag I'll be giving away!) It has all the functions I'm used to as far as presets and adding the extra 30 seconds, but the child lock is a bonus. I didn't even know they made such things, but now I don't have to worry when my grandkids come over. The 2-year-old's not so bad but the 3-year-old wants to touch everything, press all the buttons, pull all the levers! I'm having to relearn how to use a more powerful microwave, but I don't mind making that sacrifice for the better good. I've almost got the knack of cooking bacon in it. Not popcorn, though. I pop my corn on the stove top, in a pot with oil, as the good Lord intended. Wonderful product, but I have to say $115 seems a tad steep."
3,"I was so excited to get an inexpensive microwave that has three functions - air fry, convection and microwave.  I was particularly interested in the air fry function.  However, there are literally no instructions in the manual for it, and from other reviews, I read that others have called Toshiba about that, and nobody was able to help them.  I am very disappointed in that, but I will continue to try and figure it out for myself.Also, when I originally ordered the microwave, which I needed asap for when we moved into the new home, the product somehow was lost in transit.  I didn't realize how reliant I was on the microwave until I had to go a considerable amount of time without one!!  However, when I contacted Amazon through chat, they were able to send me another one which arrived fairly quickly, but not overnight, at no charge to me."
5,We needed a small microwave for a temp male shift kitchenette while our real kitchen was being redone. Could not have lived without it. Small but mighty!
1,There were no instructions or no kind of manual in the box. There is a dent on the handle and bottom when opening the door. Able to set clock but start button doesn't start the microwave. I went with this one because I don't like for the inside of the microwave to be white and their hard to find. This one has me wondering was it refurbished since there were no instructions and a few dings in it....
5,Heats and browns w heating elements overthe food. Powerful and quickly heats up food and large enough for bigger items.Highly recoommend
1,It came broken and sent it back
2,"First of all the round plate that spins around when it's cooking does not stay in place well.Secondly, this microwave is so small you can't even cook a popcorn package in it without it stopping because the popcorn package hits the sides of the tiny area the plate is in and stops rotating.I definitely do not recommend this for anyone that likes microwave popcorn or wants to put anything bigger than a microwave popcorn pkg in it.We returned ours."
5,The perfect size.  It lives on an eye-level shelf in my pantry.  I don't like over-the-range or countertop microwave ovens.  I just wish the timer alarm was louder and the turn table was easier to replace after washing.
5,Granddaughter needed a compactmicrowave for her dorm room. Works perfectly and doesn't take up much space
4,"Pros:  love the color and it's meant to be used in a small space kitchenCons: you really have to pay attention to the inside dimensions.  Measure your dinner plates!  We can squeak one in but barely.  And I can't reheat a tall travel mug of coffee.  Also, there are too many buttons for such a small unit.  In order to choose something beyond just 30 second increment-tapping, you have 3 buttons to push and a dial to spin.  Lastly, I'd forgotten what lower wattage units were like.  It takes a LONG time to defrost, reheat, heat.  Having come from a unit that was somewhere in the 1000-1200 watt range, this little pup requires patience.That said, we got it for a small apt kitchen that won't have a lot of use so the size and the COLOR are great for the cost."
4,"This is a sharp looking microwave.  The black stainless steel is very modern and makes for an attractive countertop appliance.  It has a variety of cooking options and has plenty of power to get your cooking done quickly (1100 watts).The main reason I didn't give this microwave 5 stars is that the instructions are extremely lacking, which is making it difficult to learn how to use all the different cooking options.  I was excited to try out the grill function - I've never seen a microwave with this option, plus I was curious to see how the metal cooking rack worked!! However after reading the instructions front to back, and then searching over them again, there is only a very short blurb on the grill function, which was not helpful at all. Bummer!  I really want to know how to grill with this thing!!The only other downside that I've discovered with this microwave is that it is extremely light.  This was great when I was moving it around, however now that it has a home on the counter, I've discovered that it slides easily either when I'm opening the door or even occasionally when I'm pushing buttons.  This definitely isn't a deal-breaker though and I'll most likely get some sort of tacky surface to put under it to keep it from moving around.Overall, this is a fantastic microwave and I'm very pleased with it.  Other than the two negatives that I mentioned above, everything else about this Farberware microwave meets and/or exceeds my expectations.  It's a great microwave at an affordable price."
1,"Great microwave, when it works! Keeps shutting off and only works half the time. Too expensive for it to break down like this"
4,"So far, so good - GREAT in fact!  Love the LED lighting, the ease of program selection, and the quiet! I've only had a week, and love everything about it!"
3,A bag of popcorn doesn't fit and wont rotate
3,"small, buttons are annoying to push."
5,"We love our new microwave, airfryer and convection oven all in one. Make sure you look at the ourside dimensions, it works for us and theres still plenty room under the cabinet, its a little bigger than the one we had but that was fine with us. I'm just amazed at the price for an all in one like this. Best thing is I no longer have to heat up the whole oven if we just want to make some package cookies, or some wings or a pizza etc. and its fun to play with and experiment. The sensor reheat is great, you know how you blow things up normally and then its just a stupid mess....this one reminds you its getting hot...it's really the best microwave etc we have ever owned.I have yet to use all its features, but regardless, its easy and it has reminders on the inside of the door for times for things too. Im not used to writing reviews, but i hope this helps someone."
2,"I sent the first one back because the kitchen timer didn’t work. Guess what, replacement is the same. Sometimes you get a sound, mostly not.  I like the control panel layout and physical size of the unit. The fact that the internet functions have issues is not a big deal to me. After all you still have to physically put your food in the microwave so you might as well push the buttons while you’re there.  If you need some humor in your life, read the owners manual."
2,Doesn't get hot enough and the WiFi doesn't work/connect.
3,"The easiest thing to do is provide CORRECT dimensions but evidently this cannot be done.  the interior width is NOT ~15"", but actually only 13"".  This is a big difference and the 15"" claim is the reason I bought this microwave in the first place."
1,This microwave is very cheap don’t order it.This microwave also blew up on me it was smoking over the house took me two days to get the popcorn smell out I don’t know what happened but it’s very cheap .
4,"I love the handle pull vs the push button to open the microwave. The size is fair for my small kitchen. I do notice the turntable gets off track occasionally. The cord is a decent length. The only thing I noticed I don't like is the film that covers the pushbutton easily wrinkled up almost immediately after wiping it down. That's annoying, but operates w/o any problems."
3,"Nothing wrong with the oven itself, but the instructions that came with the air fry model were for the model without the air fryer.  Searching online, the instructions online were wrong also.  I contacted their support and they said they would get back to me.  After 2 weeks, I've heard nothing.  Now I've paid extra for the air fry model, but don't exactly know how to use the feature.  I tried just using an air fryer recipe, but it didn't turn out right (meat was not completely cooked even though I think I pre-heated (just guessing?) and left the meat in longer than the recipe called for."
2,"I’m only giving this product a 2 ⭐️ ⭐️We had bought this back in Feb 2019 not even 2 years old yet and we have had problems with it now for several months. The interior light flickers  on and off when in use constantly,like a psychedelic light and it makes noises as the turntable revolves.  My husband tried to take it apart but to no avail couldn’t do it! I have had microwaves in the past that lasted at least 10 yrs and thought I could have faith in Toshiba. It would be nice to have my microwave working correctly."
2,"Perfect size, cooked foods just fine.  My issue is that every 5-6 seconds it would blip..lights flickered inside and not sure if it was a power shortage.  When you would open the door after cooking, all the steam would billow out, almost as if there wasn't any ventilation.  Returning for something different."
4,"I recently purchased the BLACK+DECKER Digital Microwave Oven and have been thoroughly impressed with its performance. The sleek stainless steel design fits perfectly in my kitchen, adding a modern touch. The 0.7 cu.ft capacity is ideal for my needs, and the turntable ensures even heating of my food.One of the standout features is the push-button door, which opens smoothly without any hassle. The child safety lock gives me peace of mind, especially with little ones around. With 700W power, this microwave heats food quickly and efficiently, saving me time on busy days.The digital controls are user-friendly and offer a range of settings that cater to different types of meals. Whether I'm reheating leftovers, defrosting frozen items, or cooking a quick snack, this microwave handles it all. It's also relatively quiet, which is a plus.One con is that the microwave is extremely lightweight, so it slides on the countertop, but that can be remedied with some 3M stickies.Overall, the BLACK+DECKER Microwave Oven is a reliable and stylish addition to my kitchen. Its combination of features, performance, and safety make it a great choice for anyone in need of a compact microwave that delivers on all fronts."
2,I've had this microwave for almost a year now and recently it has started doing this thing where it cooks for 10 seconds then isn't cooking for a few seconds then goes back to cooking again all while the timer is still ticking down. It makes things take way longer to cook and things like popcorn that need constant heat don't cook correctly (lots of kernels left in bag even after 3 mins in microwave). I guess it works still but it's pretty annoying.
2,"Ordered on Aug 20, delivered 2 days later. Set up to use as instructed and had no problems, just sounded tinny. It is now the end of Dec and the unit is grinding when in use. The turn table is dragging and makes a loud screeching noise. Went to return unit and found return time expired in Sept. Make sure to do your home work on return policy  and guaranties."
3,"Makes an occasional odd noise which concerns me a bit. But the biggest concern is that I have this on a microwave cart with a granite top and if you open the door without putting your other hand on the microwave it'll slide around. I've never had a microwave that's done this. Of course the concern is that it'll slide right off the cart, at least as far as the cord will take it. Not comfortable with that at all and view it as a safety hazard.I'm also surprised that the instruction manual gives almost no information on the grill/combo feature other than how often to press the button to get the two functions.Other than the above it's okay. Fairly quiet (other than the occasional odd noises) and it heats the food. The exterior looks good. But I would absolutely not purchase this particular microwave again."
1,"The media could not be loaded.EDIT - The microwave lasted 12 days!Now it makes a terribly loud screeching noise whenever it is heating.It sounds like squealing brakes on a trailer truck stopping in my kitchen!!Looks nice, heats good, easy to operate,but has a Really LOUD buzzing sound while in operation.Makes me worried that it won't last very long."
2,"I ran this microwave more than 15 minutes and it started to melt, it smelled like burning plastic.  buyer beware."
3,"Too cheaply made, a tin box.  Made in China.  The carousel wheels made of plastic so it made a terrible noise when turning."
3,"Normal functionality of the microwave works in terms of heating food. I use the kitchen timer function a lot, but realized that after you heat something in the microwave and then try to use the kitchen timer function any time after, when the timer runs out, there is no sound/beep.I have to unplug the microwave and replug in whenever I want to use the timer, because using the normal cooking function beforehand nullifies the sound when the kitchen timer goes out. Kind of annoying. Is there any way to trouble shoot this?"
5,Don't waste your money
3,"Supposedly a microwave and air fryer, it has buttons for convection oven, air fryer, and microwave. But the instructions include no information on air fryer, only convection oven.  And yes I know that an air fryer is basically a convection oven but why are there separate buttons for air fryer and convection oven.  The damn thing is just confusing.Also I ordered the all stainless instead of the black one, and I received a black one instead but I gave it as a gift to my daughter so I'll keep what I got."
1,put a bag of popcorn in and it didn't shut off a fire started in my kitchen
4,"I bought this microwave to replace a 2.2 cu ft., 1100 watt Frigidaire Gallery microwave that was too big for the space. I wanted to maintain or improve power, but reduce the footprint. This 1.1 cu ft, 1200 watt Panasonic has worked out very well. It is not perfect, but generally, it works great and its shortfalls are not deal breakers.Generally, it is very powerful, and does an excellent job of heating frozen prepared foods, which is mainly what I use it for. With one exception, it takes less time than my old microwave. The exception is heating a tall travel mug of water for tea. It takes longer, maybe because of the height of the mug in a much smaller space. The top of the mug barely clears the top of the microwave.I read every review here before I bought it, so I’ll address some of the concerns that others have noted.Noise: Yes, it is louder, but after you get used to it, it’s not a problem.Interference with Bluetooth and wifi:  I have not experienced this.Non-responsive keyboard touch keys: I haven’t found these keys any more difficult to use than my old microwave. However, there is one strange quirk with this microwave which may be the reason that people are not happy about the keys. After a cycle is complete, and the dings sound, it takes 60 seconds for the time keys to re-set. So, if you want to stir something and put it back in, and you press the buttons, they will not work. You either have to hit “Stop,” or “Add Time” to reset, and then you can enter more time. Very weird, and completely unnecessary.Light: The LED light is sufficiently bright to see the food.No 1-press starts (press 2 for 2:00, etc.): Yes, you have to press 2-0-0 and then start, instead of just 2 and it auto starts, like other microwaves. Not the best design, but not a dealbreaker, for me.Sensor cooking:  I’ve used a few options.  The frozen and fresh vegetable sensor works very well. Potatoes, not so great. They are consistently under cooked, although I admit I have no patience with the instructions that tell you to let the potatoes sit 5 minutes after cooking. I want them done when the bell goes off. There’s a button to add 20% more time to sensor cooking, which I use, but I still find the potatoes need another 1 – 1:30 minutes.Popcorn: Sorry, haven’t used the sensor setting. I use a silicon popcorn popper, and set it for the same time as my old microwave, The popcorn comes out great.Stops beeping when cooking is done: Some people like to have the microwave keep beeping at you until you open to door. I HATE that. I’m very happy to have it beep 5 times and be done with it.That’s about it, hope this helps you if you are considering this microwave. I like it!"
4,1. I use it only for reheating . it stops with 4 minor beeps ..not crazy sound . Does not repeat those annoying sounds any more. easy open/close2. Even heating . I am seeing the 'inverter' doing a  better job4. My original inbuilt Bosch quit working ( must be at least $1500 ) . New Unit failed in 6 months and replacement unit failed after 24 months5. But this PANASONIC is definitely a great buy at $ 2206. Noise level while cooking - It cannot beat the inbuilt Bosch  . I guess in built are always very quiet . But you have invest at least $1300 more . is it worth it ? ( you can buy KIT for thus unit and install yourself )
2,"Bought this as a gift 8 months ago. Fast forward to these recent days to a microwave that gives off sparks inside as cooking. Tried to seek help but too many issues to make them deal with it- too many hoops to jump thru to get actual help so finally stopped. It did well the first many months. The person this was a gift to has a small kitchen area and this one fit just right. It doesn't get lots of use, but it wore out quickly and dangerously.  If it works a good thing but you better not have a problem."
3,Dirst impression is that the characters on the control panel are very small and not backlit so they are hard for me to see. I have to use a flashlight and a magnifying glass to read the labels on the buttons. So I took off a star. Operation is good except for lower power setting doesn't seem to work. I've charcoaled some food that I only wanted to heat up so I took off another star. Find  better designed oven if you are old like me
4,WORKS GREAT
1,Wouldn't buy again.
4,"Great product so far. Instructions do not include any instructions for using the air fryer. Fortunately, I found a You Tube video that helped. There is a label inside that gives some info about the settings. Would have been nice if the manual at least mentioned it."
1,"We bought this microwave Sept 18, 2021. I really like the functionality options and ease of use, but last night as I was warming a plate (no metal), it made a horrible explosive sort of sound and left black powdery residue over the square silver plate on the right inside wall.  I'm very disappointed that it should stop working in such a possibly dangerous way."
5,"I'm liking the fast start with the # keypad. Hit two and the magic of tiny little waves bouncing around begins, two minutes later ding! Easy enough for more precise time entry but that's for another time"
3,after 2 years the machine now runs when you open the door and shuts off when you close the door. I would purchase the extended warranty from fair trade
1,Llego en mal estado
3,"When it working, there is strong chemical smell even after 6 weeks of usage. Vinegar and baking soda did not help for the issue."
4,"It's only been a bit over a month and I'm still trying all the features.  I think it'll work out fine.Right now, I'd advise to be aware that during the initial usage phase--there is a chemical smell that seems to need to ""wear off"" through use."
4,"Small interior, but correct wattage I needed for dorm. Worked fine, lightweight."
1,"It is impossible to set the clock on this microwave. Pressing the Clock/Timer button once puts the microwave into Timer mode not Set Clock mode as the manual says it should. If you look through the reviews, you will find over a dozen other customers reporting the same issue.My other complaint is the poor quality keypad. The labels do not line-up with the buttons, and they are difficult to depress. It looks and feels cheap. You will find this is the #1 complaint of most negative reviews.However, if you search for this exact model # (ML-EM45P) on other websites (Walmart for example) you will see that the keypad looks completely different from the one sold by Amazon. How is this possible? Is this the reason for all the keypad and clock problems? Something is not right here, and I will be buying appliances in-store from now on."
5,"It's a little bigger than a small one, but it is also the right size to put a plate in and not have it stop rotating. Haven't used all the  settings yet, but plan to use them soon. Love the weight programing and the reheating."
3,"The first couple months with this went great, but then I started to notice some issues. Namely, the buttons are already getting more difficult to push and may not respond until you press repeatedly or really hard.The other issue (and what prompted my coming back to lower the stars on my review) is that lately the noise is glitchy and loud. It will random do one long nonstop tone instead of the usual signal. Sometimes it continues to beep nonstop until you open and close the door several times. The stop/clear button does nothing to stop it most of the time. I have not been able to find a way to turn the sound off so I have to cook my food and stop the microwave before the time is up, or unplug it. If you're annoyed by loud noises this might not be the one for you."
4,"The only reason I gave 4 overall stars is because the unit came with a dent on the door. Unfortunately, we were in a bind time wise because we purchased it for a summer rental and needed to have everything in place by the end of March. There was no time to return the item, so we decided to just live with the dent. The controls are easy to use and the product as a whole was well worth the money. The box it was shipped in was not damaged, so we have to believe the item had been previously purchased, damaged, returned, and sold again with the dent."
1,"This microwave... I bought one, it came with the control smashed and the side dented in.So, naturally I returned it for a replacement.This one comes, I plug it in and it begins to cook and rotate. I did not press any buttons.I unplug it and it stops.I plug it back in and it starts up again. I hit cancel/stop and it keeps on keeping on.Disappointed is not really a strong enough word to describe my experiences with this model of Toshiba Microwave."
2,Starts to smell quickly because of constant condensation after use.
3,1.3cu Was good while it lasted. A little loud heating things but worked great until it didn't.
1,"Was needing a smaller microwave for two adults with a toddler... I thought it practical to down size since our two older children no longer live in the home and our meals rarely consist of reheating. This is mostly used for popcorn but on the occasion that we do need to reheat leftovers, we've had to switch to using plastic because our microwave safe bowls have cracked and shattered if it exceeds more than 2 minutes. This tiny microwave has destroyed pyrex bowls!!! Would not repurchase and certainly wouldn't recommend. Needless to say, we've brought out our mammoth microwave to replace the replacement 🤦Update: this microwave has stopped heating food, has set an inflated popcorn bag on fire 1:30 minutes into the popcorn setting. It is is without a doubt faulty and useless."
5,It's small I say for one person. It works very well I'm happy with it
1,Only lasted 3 years
1,"The product arrived on time-well packaged. There is s a very strong chemical smell exuding from it. I tried vinegar to remove the stench. Didn't work. Thought I would try it out for 10 days and see if chemical smell would dissipate-uh uh. Then I noticed the intense headaches I started getting. Decided to place it in outside storage and see how it would affect my headaches-they immediately improved and after a few days have gone away. So, if you are sensitive to strong, toxic chemical smells I would advise you try another product. Thing is, I have purchased this same microwave before and did not have this problem. I will return it-this is the second one I have tried recently and they both had the same chemical odor. I think China is trying to poison us."
5,"There I was just minding my own business and relaxing one evening, when all of a sudden I hear my girlfriend yelling from the kitchen. Now, this isn't all that uncommon, as she has no idea what she's doing in there, but this couldn't be food related; we'd already had dinner and it was getting late.No, what my girlfriend decided to do was to microwave her wax (the kind ladies use to rip hair out), not for the recommended 15 seconds, but for a whopping minute and a half. The wax had boiled and melted the container and destroyed the microwave. But that was a cheap old microwave anyway. No one misses it. Not even the microwave's mom.So, we ordered this one (on the condition that she no longer microwaves wax) and it's been fantastic. I especially like that you can mute it so you don't wake up aforementioned girlfriend when you got some late night drunk munchies and the only thing that's gonna hit the spot is that 5 cheese Hot Pocket you've had stashed in the back of the freezer since you were single.July 2020 edit: the light in the microwave has gone out, so I can no longer watch the 5 cheese Hot Pocket explode when I hit the wrong number, but it still works fine."
5,For small microwave it really good one
3,The door does not open properly. It sticks when you push the open button.
4,"It has high wattage and heats food quickly. The other features like automatic reheat overheat the food. Like other microwaves, the food heats unevenly, really hot and cool areas in the food being heated. There are cheaper microwaves that will work just as well. It is attractive with a stainless front."
4,needs to be better a user friendly. a little on the complicated but we love the look and size of it!
4,"This microwave works very well. Powerful, and easy to clean. But there is one very annoying fault. The main button at lower right, that opens the door, pivots around its center, so if you push it even slightly off center, the button will tilt, and stick in, tilted. As in, it won't pop back out. You have to repress the button to get it to pop back out. This means that when you press the button to open the door your really should press on it EXACTLY at the center of the button. More often than not, I have to repress the button to get it to pop back out. This is a design fault."
5,"I received my order in a few days but the unit didn't power up.  Bummer.  HOWEVER, I went to my order page and there was a button for tech support. I clicked the button and it immediately took my phone to tech support.  Jeffrey answered and walked me through a couple of reset troubleshoots but they didn't work either.  He then offered me a free replacement.  He sent me a return QR code for the local UPS store via email and sent me my new microwave which came in two days.  Works perfectly.  My wife loves the grill feature.  Me, personally just warm up soup, coffee, hot dogs, etc.  It works great and we love it.  I would recommend this microwave and DEFINITELY recommend Amazon Prime!!!"
2,"Came with a huge dent right near the motor in the back. The dent is very visible and ugly, and I have to position the microwave to make sure the dent doesn’t show, so that limits where I can set it up in the kitchen. I’m worried that Whatever caused the dent (likely someone dropping the microwave) will affect its functionality."
2,Not as sturdy as expected
2,"This microwave does most of what it's intended to, but there are two major disappointments. First, this unit has a grilling feature which sounded great. Unfortunately it requires a 12"" clearance above the unit. As our upper cabinets are the standard 18"" above the counter and the unit is 13"" high, there is only a 5"" clearance, so we have never been able to use the grilling feature. The second major disappointment is the interior light. After 2 years and one month, it quit working. It is inside a sealed unit and there is no way to replace it. Customer service said that the only solution is to buy a new microwave. Our GE microwave is almost 20 years old - the light still works"
1,"I purchased this microwave for the bar we built in our basement We don't use the bar often but I wanted a microwave down there to heat up stuff and make popcorn.  I unpackaged it, set it on the counter and plugged it in.  It came right on so I was happy with it.  I unplugged it and it's been on the counter ever since, along with the other items (blender, coffee maker - all which are unplugged until used) Fast forward to today - the first time I'm actually going to use it as I have guests coming to hang out at our bar.  I plug it in.  Nothing.  I search all over to see if there's a reset or a power button.  Nothing.  I test the outlet - everything else works in it.  I watch the video Amazon provided, no help because there is no on button.  I'm beyond the 90 days for support because who would think a BRAND NEW product wouldn't work the first time you use it.  I also can't get a refund or return it so I wasted my money.  I can't give this less than one star and would give it zero stars if I could."
1,"We got this microwave when we moved to an apartment without a built in microwave and the original microwave (1.2 cu ft) was too big for the counter. This microwave was just the right size (fit our plates/bowls) and worked ok for 2.5 years, but then the magnetron failed resulting in it being on all the time when plugged in. It seemed it would cost more to fix it than just buy a new one."
2,"It's an OK microwave. It heats food well enough, though it seems to prefer heating the bowl/plate more than the foot (previous microwave did not have this issue with the same serving ware). Melting butter is difficult, the ceramic becomes too hot to touch before the butter is melted. Again, previous microwave (same wattage) did not do this.Needs rubber feet, it just slides around on the counter as it's a pull handle door.We love that we can turn off the beeping, so that's a huge plus.Biggest complaint is a constant buzzing that comes from it while it isn't running. It's similar to an electrical socket buzz, but clearly coming from the microwave. It peaks around 10k hz and goes past 50k. Audible with the door shut, but quite annoying when the door is open."
5,Pretty well made and attractive color scheme.  Purchased as backup for a large older Samsung built-in that breaks down at times.  Saved the day!
4,thought it would be 1100w of power but it is not. otherwise good.
2,"The microwave offers some nice features at its price point.  This model is LOVED by many reviewers.  I found the unit a little loud and the keyboard really mushy and nondescript.  The Alexa integration is very poor.  There is a third party MHome app that you have to use and the versioning or something just doesn't align.  This means that many commands ""as written"" do not work.  You get very tired of hearing ""I'm sorry, I don't know what went wrong!"".  Very dissapointing unit if you want/need Alexa integration.  This microwave went right back to Amazon.  Thank you Prime!"
5,"First of all, it's not 1100 watts. The manual that came with it says it's 1000 watts. Also, inside the door it says 1000 watts. I still like it though. At full power, it heats very fast. Doesn't take up too much space, making it perfect for a small kitchen. Well designed, easy to use keypad."
5,Easy to use right out the box it has  nice blue light on the inside very distinctive buttons easy to use and see  heats up evenly
4,Nice machine works well and quietly
3,The front panel of the controls is loose for some reason I have yet to determine.  It heats fine and I've had it for a few months.  I'd look into something a little cheaper since I didn't expect loose parts on an item in this price range.Hopefully that's the only fault and I'll get some mileage out of this.
4,"For those trying to connect the alexa skill: create a login for the ""MSmartLife"" app.Even though the skill shows a different app and company, they are actually  part of the same parent corporation and your msmartlife app login info WILL work. just make sure your password is longer than 6 characters and shorter than 20 and it will let you log in and link the app.This microwave is fine. works well. I tried out the reheat coffee feature from and it PERFECTLY warmed up my cup of cold coffee.will edit and add more to the review after more use. just wanted to get this posted to help people figure out how to get the alexa skill linked.Cheers."
2,I had this microwave for only a 1yr and 4 months and it stopped heating it still come on make the usual noise but it don't heat at all
4,I'm having to put food in for a longer period of time to warm up food.  Disappointing.
5,I love this microwave's multiple functions including the air fryer. Yum. And it's small enough to sit in my counter yet big enough to cook sides for two.
3,"Not the greatest microwave ever....The plate easily comes dis-attached, the wattage isn't up to par with modern microwaves so you have to cook food longer, and it's not exactly stainless steel."
2,It's bigger than the picture describes
2,"When we first received the Microwave it worked great. Easy to clean, Easy to operate. However after 5 months the microwave stopped working with a error code H97. Since it's still under manufacture warranty I was able to get a hold of someone in my area to fix it. Or replace it!"
3,"UPDATE 3/22: The top inside crackles when cooking. Sounds like it will catch fire.While needing to replace a very old microwave, I discovered it was possible to reduce 2 appliances (counter stove + mwave) into 1 appliance. I did  lot of research and review reading and was adamant that whatever I purchased would not take up a huge amount of counter space. This was the smallest dual purpose appliance with good reviews.As it turns out, I use it for everything. I typically keep the power at 10 and just rely on the sensor cook, while 1.5 minutes works for heating up a cup of tea water. I haven't yet figured out easy defrost, but again the sensor cook has served me well. Highly recommend!"
2,"Microwave broke after 4 months.Nice, big, easy to use but doesn't last at all.We really liked this microwave right up until it just stopped working."
2,"I generally only try to write positive product reviews . . . but . . . this microwave died exactly 1 year and 1 week after we purchased it.  It was a fairly nice microwave while it worked.  It did get daily use.  However, I think a microwave appliance should last longer than a year.  Call me old fashioned.  Also, the controls on the microwave are not intuitive, and I had to refer back to the manual a few different times to figure some things out (such as power controls).  I probably would rate it a 4/5 but for the durability."
5,Works well opening and operating. Easy to clean. Standard size fits any plate..
5,"Small spacious Microwave that fits nicely on the Countertop, heats up food fast and easy to use. heating up food in this Microwave takes no time at all plus it's nice and quiet too not bad for the price at all, highly Recommended, Awesome Microwave!"
3,"The door has to be manually opened--no pushing a button to open the door. That's hard when your hands are full. Plus, the annoying feature of having to hit time to cook every time before entering a selected time is a pain. I usually just hit the 30 sec+ button and go from there. Recommended because it's well made but it is small and has some quirky features."
1,It ran for 10 seconds and then never ran again.
3,This would be a great Microwave except for the fact that it smells like something is on fire when it runs. I am afraid to leave it plugged in when we leave the house. We are seniors and use it to mostly heat up liquid and defrost items when needed. I had a microwave for almost 20 years before we bought this one. Hasn't been but 6 months since we purchased this one on Amazon.
4,This microwave works great. Haven't had any issues with heating at all. I will say however it's loud and it sounds like something is not quite right internally. Not really sure but maybe it's getting stuck between eco mode and regular. But it works just fine nonetheless just a weird sound while it's in use. It looks nice on the counter and is super easy to use.
5,"I purchased this microwave 13 months ago.  I did not purchase any extended warranty.  There was one item missing from the package, the ring that holds the glass plate. Amazon gave me a rebate of the cost of the ring because I did not want to the trouble to return or exchange.  13 months later the keypad was only partially working.  Numbers 1 thru 5 worked as well as the 30 second start button.  I contacted Black and Decker.  After sending them my proof of purchase, they issued me a check for a full refund. They did not have to do this.  I was past the 12 month time.  So, this is my way of saying thanks to Black and Decker  and let you all know the company showed integrity with me."
5,Better than any other brand. Easy to use
5,"I never thought I'd review a microwave, but I'm SO satisfied with this purchase. It came in ONE day.It is the perfect size for my galley, apartment kitchen. It STILL fits my unnecessarily large, 11"" diameter dinner plates. The mirror finish is SO GORGEOUS.I've read reviews on Amazon, Walmart, etc. online of other people saying they really liked this microwave. As other reviewers mentioned, the door is opaque so food isn't visible while cooking. Not to worry because if you're a coffee-reheater like me, there is a BEVERAGE button!!!! I'm really ecstatic."
1,"First of all, I have kept my microwave immaculately clean with plenty of ventilation space on all sides. If there is steam buildup on the interior, I wipe it down before closing the oven. Interior is like new. My microwave will be 4 years old in July 2023. Within the first few months the interior light first flickered crazily, then dimmed almost to completely out, but there must be a small bulb inside the casing as you can see a dim glow through the vent holes on the inside wall of the oven - no big deal. Now after reading other reviews, this is the apparent start of it's death. Heating times need to be increased as the oven ages - not a problem. Within the past few months, after heating for a period, usually in excess of one minute, it shuts down for a short period of time, then beeps and resets. Unplugging does not reset. You must wait until it is ready to work again and it will alert you when it turns back on beeping. Down time is based on how long it had been heating before shutting down. Sometimes it can't decide if it wants to be off or on and will play games by beeping, then stop, then start beeping again, and stop, until it decides whether it wants to be on or off. Annoying if you have just heated your coffee for a minute and now want to thaw out a muffin. You will have to reheat the coffee if it allows you to.  It was like a sulking child, now it's like an evil one. It starts, beeps after two seconds, stops. Starts, stops, then suddenly restarts. Time must be reset each time. All of the automatic cooking buttons (pizza, popcorn, potato, etc.) run 1 minute then end (unless it decides to stop before one minute). Don't leave it alone - it may be dangerous. I have had bad luck with microwaves in all price ranges, so now I just buy a cheap one and hope for the best, but it won't be a Toshiba."
4,"It is loud, sound very tinny. it does work for what I need. I use it multiple times in the day 1 minute each time. Touch pad is ok. I am hopeful that it has a long life span.It does look nice. I like the 30 second button."
4,"Love this microwave, but the feet on the bottom are weak plastic.  Be careful when trying to slide it on rough surfaces. I broke one when it got caught on something. Otherwise, I really like the way the settings work. They might take getting used to, but they're really convenient. (When you push 1-6, it enters that number of minutes and starts, there are 10 seconds more and 10 seconds less options, and a 30 second option that starts the microwave.) I haven't used the convection feature yet."
5,"My daughter took this with her to college. It's a great size for her. It is somewhat noisy, but no one has complained. It wasn't difficult to carry up several flights of stairs.  It heats the food the way that the food packaging suggests it should."
5,"Truly liberating! maybe I'm easy to please but this Alexa enabled microwave is really nice. The loud obnoxious beeps when food is done cooking are now gone with this microwave, a gentle wave sound comes from it to alert you your food is done cooking. The 1100 watts is just what I was looking for in a microwave! Finally! I mean most frozen food packaging nowadays says don't even attempt to cook it in a microwave under 1100 watts. Results? much nicer than previously owned microwaves! the 1100 watts makes a difference that's for sure and the food is being cooked as directed by the chefs in the test kitchens to the specifications. Lets talk about Alexa, setting up the Alexa enabled feature was interesting. I looked at the quick setup instructions and then followed them to no avail. I opened the booklet that came with the oven and followed those instructions and was up and running very quickly. The cool factor for just talking and turning on the oven is definitely pleasing! Thank you technology! I cant wait for those times when the fingers are all filled with sticky food and I need to start the oven Alexa will start it for me no touch no mess! Lets say you are stuck in traffic and you put the roast in the oven to defrost you can start the oven by using the Alexa app or your car echo. I see endless possibilities with this technology! You are on the slopes skiing and tell Alexa to heat up the hot chocolate so its waiting for you when you get home. I have only scratched the surface of what the oven can do and look forward to discovering more. This is a definite recommend shout out must buy!"
5,"Our over the range microwave needed replacement but due to a custom fit we had to wait six weeks for installation. We bought this for $100 as a temporary replacement. Our new over the range microwave is now installed . We will keep this as a backup. It's sleek, heats well, size is just right for pantry or countertop. Price point is excellent."
3,It's ok but cooks or defrost unevenly
4,"Trying to get the microwave and the App to play nice together took some fiddling and patience.  I have this struggle with other ""smart"" devices and it is just a matter of ""keeping trying"".  Eventually it worked.  Enabling the app with Alexa was fine.  And then....super super easy to use with Alexa.  Just say, Alexa microwave for 1 minute or whatever time.The microwave time is off by two hours.  I put in the correct time, but it reverts to 2 hours ahead.  So, I'll have to track down why it's doing that.  Probably a location issue with one of the apps it syncs to.  But, I'm a techy person, so its not a hardship for me like others.The reviews for Toshiba microwaves, any model, are very good.  So, the Alexa capability is a bonus for me.I'll update if there are issues later on."
1,I had to return it because it was dented  and the door would not open on the microwave
4,"This microwave is okay if you have small space available.  I don't really care for it because of a few reasons.  It is not wide enough, and it is too deep for its width.  It is hard to get seconds added to the cooking time.  For example, you cannot just press 530 to get 5 minutes and 30 seconds.  as soon as you press 5, it goes to 5 minutes and starts running.  To get 5 minutes and 30 seconds, you have to press the ""Cook Time - Clock"" button two times, and then you can set minutes and seconds for cook time.  Its design is not very smart since in order to get to cook time, you have to get past the clock-set first, and if you don't do that, you mess up the clock setting.  It is also a bit front heavy, and with the door open you can drop it forward if it is on a shelf and you pull the door a bit too hard.  I have not tried it with Alexa so, I don't know how that works.  Cooking power is good and it seems to be working normal like the other microwave we had before this one.  Heat distribution is not as good as it should be.  I think it is because it is smaller inside, so the food dish does not go in a circle on the turntable.  The food dish mainly rotates around itself as opposed to going around, unless if you have a very small dish on the turntable.For a small space and the price, it is a good microwave."
4,Very nice and quiet..
1,Terrible product that broke a week after warranty expired.
5,"Plenty of power, and the sensor reheat function is a revolutionary step ahead of others."
5,Delivered on time. Works great. Fair price
5,I'm very happy with it so far. I have always had good luck with Panasonic microwaves. My last one went recently & their customer service went above & beyond to help me even though I'd had it for 6 years & no longer had proof of purchase. It works great & the door is easier to close than on my old one. All in all I'm very happy with it & expect many years of use from it.
2,"On my old GE I would press the 30 second button and it would run.  Now I need to also press the start button.  To cook for 3 minutes on my old GE I would press ""3"" and it would run for 3 minutes.  Now I have to press 3, then 0, then 0, then Start.  No huge deal, but.....Also, this unit is VERY noisy."
2,"For the price,  @$75 on sale,  very good buy.  Attractive unit,  works just fine.  Not really a mini or small;  more medium size.  Only real negative is that it is noticeably loud in when operating.  Update Jan 2023.  Although microwave continues to work in spite of the loud hum;  the outside panel has begun getting very warm.  Suspect it may die soon from overheating."
5,The microwave has a relays all capacity but is plenty large enough for most people’s needs. Sits on a counter and doesn’t take up much space. The controls are easy to read and does the job very well.
2,I'd give this microwave a 4 out of 10 stars. Seems to lake longer to heat food than previous microwave that died.
3,"It was very nice, just much smaller then I thought it would be. I guess I didn't know what 0.7 cu. ft was."
2,"when I am pressing on open button, it doesn't open door, so I have to use both hands to open microwave, that is not nice, although Microwave working ok so far"
2,"The media could not be loaded.The microwave I received makes a buzzing noise when plugged-in (see video) and a hot burning plastic smell when on.I bought my specific Panasonic NN-SN936B from Amazon Warehouse as a like-new, refurbished open-box item. I was confident, based on Amazon's description of the ""like-new"" state that it had been returned, inspected, tested, then marked as ""refurbished."" I guess the tester who inspected it didn't listen to the microwave when plugged in, because as soon as you do plug it in, it makes a high-pitched, easily audible buzzing noise.I actually made a video of the sound, documented on my phone placed inside the microwave with a frequency analyzer app. In the video, I switch the power to the microwave on and off a couple times, and as soon as the power is on, you can see the background noise (about 63Hz at 82dB) get washed out by the microwave's buzzing noise, which is about 12,000Hz at 73dB. You can't HEAR the buzzing in the video, I'm guessing because the audio compression cuts it out. Yes, my phone is upside-down, I wanted the microphone closer to the source of the sound!Also, when I used the microwave for more than 30 seconds, it made a hot burning plastic smell. It's likely not plastic burning up, but some electronic component inside overheating, probably the inverter power source. Regardless, the microwave I received does not seem safe, and I hope Amazon doesn't just repackage it and send it out to someone else...I realize that about 5% of all electronic manufactured items have a defect, but it's disappointing that THIS particular microwave was returned to Amazon, (supposedly) inspected and ""refurbished,"" and then sent back out without someone realizing there is an electronic fault with the power source.I'm posting this review on the NEW microwave listing, even though I purchased a refurb one from Amazon Warehouse so anyone who gets a similarly defective item knows right away they have a problem. Amazon Warehouse's return policy was easy, so I returned it and bought a new microwave (a silver Panasonic NN-SN966S) and haven't had any problems with that one so far.As far as the microwave's features, I like the reheat function, but usually have to hit the ""Less"" button when using it so it doesn't overheat the food. The door makes a loud noise when closing, even when being gently pushed closed. The silver version of this microwave (NN-SN966S) has a quieter door. I wish the timer function worked while microwaving (my old microwave did that) and the timer sound is really kinda quiet and it only beeps five times, then off. My wife is concerned she won't hear it from another room in the house. Also, the turbo-defrost function works great... when I used it for frozen raw chicken and frozen raw meatloaf, it defrosted each perfectly without cooking the edges."
4,"We have been using a Cuisinart Microwave for the about 3 yrs now and I just got sick of it,  slow to heat food and ALWAYS hot and cold spots that needed several more minutes to get the food uniformly hot. This microwave is the exact opposite. the food is always equal in temperature. I don't cook in the microwave, just reheat except for red potatoes. This microwave slays the potato to the extent you would think they were baked in the oven! I gave it 4 stars because it is a little difficult to read the lettering on the controls for seniors that are having vision problems but for my purposes I only use 2 or three buttons so I have gotten used to what and where to push. So far I love it!"
2,"It is extremely loud.  We bought this to put into our new house, which we have just moved into. Too late to send back, or I definitely would."
2,What air fryer? Nothing in the manual on how to use it. All it has was a air fyrer button on the screen.
1,"I had a similar, larger Panasonic microwave that I had for several years until my autistic son decided to cook popcorn in it in the middle of the night for over 15 minutes. After shutting down the smoke alarms and clearing the house of smoke, I found that the center plastic spindle had melted, so I jumped on Amazon to purchase this newer model.Unfortunately, this newer model intermittently just shorts out and I have to spend several minutes unplugging and plugging it back in, rotating the center spindle by hand, and occasionally swearing at it and threatening to throw it in the garbage until it decides to function again. And no, my son's popcorn is now stored in the garage, so he hasn't touched the new microwave.My guess is that this unit will permanently die soon especially if there is a problem with the circuits on the motherboard that are causing the intermittent short. When that happens, I'll buy a brand other than Panasonic."
5,"Works well.  Has an audible ""Done"" alarm that can  be silenced ahead of use."
4,Ridiculous that ther is no instruction manual with the product.
1,"If I could give them a ""0"", I would. The microwave is less than 3 years old and only has a 1 year warranty. Now I can see why!  I have had microwaves for over 5 years and never have had anything like this happen to one. I have given microwaves away in better condition. The microwaves in the past have never rusted. The suggestion from Customer Service was to get paint and paint over the rust.  I googled what to do with a microwave that starts to rust, and it says throw it away.  Really, your telling me to paint over the rust.  I will not be buying another Comfee product again since they do not stand behind their products."
1,"This sounds wonderful and I really wanted it. Delivery was supposed to be in 2 days by UPSAfter 7 days, UPS shipped it to Seattle Wa.I live in Tampa Florida! After 3 excruciatingly difficult calls to Amazon customer service, I got a refund issued. I’m now trying to find this microwave from somewhere other than Amazon."
1,"The microwave has been working mostly fine till today. I bought in October of last year. The one issue I've been having for a few weeks now is. The door release button giving more resistance to the press making it harder to open. But tonight when I'm heating up some food I started smelling a burnt wire smell. I was standing right next to it. So I looked at the wall plug and nothing. I quickly opened up the microwave door and see inside. Smoke coming out of the little vent on the top right corner. So I unplugged it, If I would have not been standing next to it I'm sure it would have caused a fire."
5,Love it! Easy to use & works great!Fast shipping!
5,"This does have microwave, oven and air fryer functions.you can save space with one for three. I have used all three functions . So far it works very well."
1,"Now you know why they only warranty it for one year.  I've only had it for a year and a half, and now it doesn't work.  It actually started failing shortly after a year, under cooking meals. Now it is completely dead, with a H98 error."
2,Oh dear. This was just what we wanted and for 3 weeks it was great. Then it started cutting off 45-60 seconds into a cycle. This happened 2 or 3 times. The next time it started smoking so back it went.
1,Got it with the box damage a few scratches and the plastic ring in the inside broke!!
3,"I should have bought the 1.6 cubic foot instead of the 2.2, but that's entirely my fault - I misjudged the size I needed. :)  Having said that, this unit works incredibly well. I'm particularly satisfied with the sensor reheat and the defrost functions. Nothing gets overcooked, and on the defrost, nothing gets partially cooked, either! Great unit!My only wish would be that the beeper when finishing or timer expiring would be a little louder. Not that its quiet, but if you have multiple things going on in the kitchen, you can miss it.*****Update - one year later. Lowering my rating to 3 stars because after 1 year, the door latch - INSIDE the unit, not on the door itself - broke. The nearest authorized repair center was in Philadelphia, well over 150 miles away, and a local repair guy quoted me $135 to do the repair - and recommended that I simply buy a new one, since the price was now down to $171.I still love the unit, but do NOT swing the door shut and use momentum to latch it. Bring it to the point of closing, then PRESS firmly. No slamming.Looked at getting a replacement part and fixing it myself... almost impossible to find these. I'd probably buy it again, but... people in my home need to be far more gentle than with our old microwave, that they could simply slam shut.Even so, it shouldn't break that easy, in my opinion, hence the drop from 5 stars to three."
3,"The microwave works fine.  My only complaint is that when we use it, it interferes with my WiFi.  My streaming stops working.  I can't hear or be heard on Zoom meetings."
5,"Have had three Panasonic counter-top microwaves before this. First one died of old age (many years old. Can't remember exactly how many, but it was ober 15.)Second one, something in it exploded .... no parts flying around, just a good-sized bang, some smoke and a dead oven. Was only about 5-7 years old.Third one developed the door latch problem that so many people have reported:  the door latch doesn't close properly, the oven won't turn on.  Started after about 5-6 years. We extended its life a year by pushing down on the door while shutting it - and holding it down - then pushing the start button. Worked most of the time. Sometimes after multiple start/stops while cooking one meal it would konk out.  VERY frustrating!Finally brokedown and bought a new one after being told by Panasonic that they'd solved the ""door problem"" on new models. We'll see.So, you ask, why did you keep buying the same problematic microwave over and over?  Dumb and dumber?!  Because Panasonic makes the biggest (2.2 cu ft) and most powerful (1200 watts) microwave that we could find for a reasonable price (< $200) that also works extremely well and has some very nice features (defrost works well, sensor cooking does a reasonably good job of cooking evenly, etc). Would rather spend the money every 5 years or so to have a microwave that we know works well, than the same amount for one that doesn't and perhaps have to put up with it for much longer.  Seems like a mildly Faustian bargain that shouldn't be necessary. But that's the climate of business models we live with today. I don't think I'll ever have one die of old age again.Will try to remember to update this as time goes by.  Stay tuned."
4,Plastic over the numbers & cook options starting to bubble & peel...after only having it for 2 months!
1,"Died in 3 months- just stopped working one day.Their customer service representative asked for all the information (no problem, I had it ready for them) then said I have to submit it via email- after keeping me on hold for 7 minutes- because “It’s a different department”. I’ll certainly send that email but I’m not holding my breath here. Will absolutely avoid this company."
4,"Got exactly what paid for.  On the cost side, low end.  But, a full sized interior and good power.  The exterior metal gauge is a little thin ... the sort of thing expected for the cost paid.  But a really good value overall."
3,I’ve had this microwave for just over a year. It frequently sparks when we use it. It’s been a fire hazard for sure and unfortunately our return or support window has closed so we’re unable to get help with it. Very disappointed in the fact that this started happening about 9-10 months in of having purchased it plus disappointed with the lack of additional support provided.I typically don’t leave reviews but I feel this important for others to know when considering this item.
2,"This microwave has very little power and takes forever to warm up anything. I bought it for the compact size, but I didn't realize it would be so weak."
1,"My fault. Did not open the gift until moved in. too late to return. the door button to open is broken. will not function. bummer, not sure how it passed QC from factory"
5,I am very happy with the Faberware Microwave.  It is a lot easier to use than the one I had and should have ordered a new one a long time ago if I had known I could get one this Nice.
2,Confusing to understand how to operate the button selections.  I have to unplug to correct the setting.  The setting buttons are dark--have to use my flashlight. The operation instructions are also complicated.
3,"It is almost impossible to read the panel on this microwave, which is the main reason for the 3 star rating. Makes no sense that it is so dark and hard to see! I did think the interior would be larger. It will be OK, too much trouble to return and it took forever to decide on this one! I do wish they'd stop use a handle to open the door, instead of pushing lever. Basically, it worked ok. Feel you can get same quality for less money. Wish I'd gotten something else, to be honest."
5,"This microwave doesn't occupy much space and looks really nice. I love it, and think it's really cute looking. It has a small interior, and I have to tilt my 9"" dinner plates to fit them in, but I'm fine with that.  I use it mostly for TV dinners and to heat a cup of coffee, and cook bacon, and it's perfect for my needs. I read the reviews before I bought it and a lot of people were complaining about the buzzer being too loud. It rings four times to let you know something is done, and I don't find that obtrusive at all. It's about the same loudness as my old Amana microwave. I think it's a great machine and recommend it enthusiastically."
5,Decided to keep this excellent microwave for myself instead of returning it. Excellent purchase came in new condition. Super seller here folks.
1,"Microwave came broken. It will not heat food at all. Going to return ASAP.Follow up: I didn't think it was possible to become more disappointed about this purchase, but surprise! Anything is possible. I received a replacement that worked fine for a little while, but it unexpectedly died for no reason. Mid microwaving my food, it just shut off by itself. There were no power or connection issues, it is just an awful microwave. Apparently this product is designed to barely outlive the 30 return window so that Amazon can keep your money. Thanks. Absolutely would not recommend, would never buy this brand of anything again."
5,"I have used a few chefman products and never had an issue with them so I didnt hesitate to order this one. I like that this has extra features, it's powerful and works really well."
5,Band name and good quality. Very reasonable price.
4,Nice large microwave with a lot of power.  I like the white light inside which makes it easy to see what's cooking.  They have changed this up since the last Panasonic that I had - instead of a one minute button now it is 30 seconds.  The door doesn't always close the first time though.  Sometimes I have to push the button to open it and then close it again.
2,The microwave is a perfect size for a small apartment. I barely use it and it's already broken.
5,"I am loving this new combo, microwave, air fryer, convection oven that I purchase. It works extremely well in every aspect. The only thing is you do have to adjust the times you’re used to for certain things but overall that’s pretty easy to do. Extremely durable and easy to clean after each cooking. Highly recommend getting this if you’re looking for a good size microwave."
2,"kinda cheap feeling but I was okay with that at first until now. Arrived mid March, now in June the light started flickering but it's outside of the return window. The door is very light and cheap, when you shut it it's very loud. also, the microwave is very loud as it runs. I miss my old microwave.. I should've shelled out mor eand gotten a Panasonic or a Sharp.. won't purchase this brand again. should've been a 60$ microwave for the quality.. Only real pluses are that it doesn't keep beeping when you open the door, it beeps to let you know and doesn't do annoying reminder beeps. Also, you can press the off/cancel button and turn the clock off which is nice. other than that, not worth it. Pay a little more for a better microwave.  The grill function is kinda useless. I tried toasting bread, took forever to even get slightly crispy. By that time it's easier to just through a slice in a buttered pan.. Oh well."
5,Works very well to reheat stuff. Ideal for small plates and cups to heat.Perfect for a small space. I use it for my office and it’s perfect
1,"The Alexa connection does not work.  The reheat finally stops after the coffee has boiled over.  Why do they put the clock setting and the cook time on the same button; and if they are going to do that why make you press the button twice to set the cook time and only once to set the clock; I guess because everyone knows you have to set the clock so many more times than set the cook time.Four calls to customer service with no help; only suggestion was to send the oven back.  Asked to talk to someone in IT, but they couldn't connect me.  Asked to talk to a supervisor; they took my name and number and said a supervisor would call me in about ten minutes.  Two days later and I have not received a call; guess I can go to bed.  Horrible customer service.  Luckily I saved the original box and the oven from Hell is going back to where it belongs."
1,"I should have looked at how many 1- and 2-star reviews this microwave model has accumulated!Beginning with our third use after taking the oven out of its shipping box, it began making a loud grinding noise while running. I've used microwave ovens at home and in offices since about 1985 and have never heard one make this sound!And as others have commented, the compartment accumulated moisture while heating a simple cup of hot water."
2,Our light is not working - have owned for 18 months.  The push to open button also isn't opening the door very well either.
2,"Fits nicely in space I needed it.Very noisy and food starts crackling as soon as turned on. It worries me, actually. The food cooking sounds like it's arcing or burning. A lot of smoke inside after heating things.More complicated to use than any I've ever had. I would not recommend it."
5,This was purchased for college dorm use. Great size and light weight.
2,"Cheaply made , I should have spent a few more dollars for a better unit. Plastic covering the start button is torn after six weeks of use."
5,This was delivered very quickly and is the perfect size for a dorm room.  Also very good value.
2,"I use my microwave for 2 basic purposes, reheat and as a timer for things in the oven.  I need the beep, beep, beep reminder.  The reheat functionality is fine however you can't use the timer and the microwave at the same time.  You have to stop/clear the timer to use the microwave.  The other annoyance is the timer always uses 4 digits.  If you type in 15 (as in 15 seconds) that is 15:00 mins.  If you want 15 seconds you have to type in 0015.  Annoying.  Those are the only features I have tried.  So, if the timer functionality is something you consider critical to your microwaving future I'd say look for a different brand/model."
1,"Just difficult to use, multiple buttons need to be pushed for popcorn or heating a coffee up, just terrible in every way."
5,Works perfect for my daughter in collage. She likes it.
1,I am a senior citizen who needs simple directions to operate this microwave.....and simple directions were not present.  I donated this to a thrift store and bought a microwave I could operate with the least effort.  Who knew?
3,"As a general statement, yes...this microwave will heat your food and drink.  It usually plays nicely with Alexa, but will occasionally refuse to recognize commands listed on the microwave itself.  For example, the microwave sticker says to say to your Alexa device:  ""Alexa reheat 1 cup of coffee.""  Alexa says it doesn't know that command.  That's happened with several of the commands printed on the sticker in the microwave.  The most irritating thing this microwave does it that it CANNOT keep the correct time of day for anything.  I thought it might be the change around Daylight Savings time, but nope.  We still have to reset the clock multiple times a day.  In summary, if you don't really care about the ""smart"" part of your microwave, this one is a pretty reliable cooking device.  Happy microwaving!"
1,"Farberware Microwave works fine for One Year, then malfunctions-!NOTE: When the Timer Buttons for 1, 2, or 3 minutes is pressed, Oven works for 1. 2, or 3 minutes.Timer when on ; 4+ minutes, does not operate oven AT ALL. Nothing-!You have to press 3, wait until it cooks, then after count down is over, press 3 again, as many times as needed.BEWARE-!!!"
4,"I bought this without reading reviews, so the time it takes to cook something is much longer. That’s something I’m okay with! It’s my own fault for not reading everything thoroughly. My one complaint is that the microwave itself is pretty loud when you’re trying to be quiet so it’s nice that it doesn’t beep when you have that setting on, but it heats noisily."
2,"We've had the microwave for less than a year, with moderate use (defrosting, reheating) nothing where it runs for a long period.  Today it stops working, completely/totally.  Panasonic offers ""live chat"" yet no one answers.  24/7 email is offered but it's an automated reply based on the information you provide upfront.  The reply was to take the microwave to a service center - according to their website there is none within 100 miles.  The two star rating, instead of 1 star, is due to while it worked we liked it."
4,No complaints. Does what a microwave should.
4,"Great little microwave that fits well on my counter in a studio apartment where counter and kitchen space is at a premium. Still, I can reheat pretty big dishes. I think this is great for dorm rooms, studios, and office break rooms. It works great and heats evenly and thoroughly."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!
3,"After about a month of use, the door does not spring open when you press the door release button. It seems that the spring, or whatever configuration it has, does not force the door open. You have to physically grab the bottom of the door to pull it open after the latch releases. Poor design?? I would have expected better from Panasonic.2/19/2019 update -Just spent 50 minutes chatting with Panasonic Support. There are no carry-in service centers within 300 miles of me, so I am stuck waiting for Panasonic to escalate my repair case, if they will. Seems their service is no better than their products these days."
5,better than the previous model we had. Overall a very nice microwave. Wish there was a function to add or minus time by 10 seconds.
3,"Will update after a period of testing: Door closes much easier than last Panasonic microwave. This model which is an Amazon Pick, stated it has a Quick Minute timer, which it does not., and the reason gave it only 3 stars for user interface."
4,Very nice very easy to use the only thing I don't like is the light on clock is real dim You can hardly see it
4,"Overall it's a good microwave.  It looks good.  It's got good power.  It's a little noisy but it's in my kitchen, and I don't generally drag the recliner from the living room into the kitchen to sit quietly and read or nap.  It passes the basic microwave litmus test:  It thoroughly cooks microwave popcorn.  It's got this heating element ""grill"" on the top of inside so you can grill (?) food.  Never used it.  That grill also makes it really really hard to clean up an exploded pizza roll that has evenly distributed pepperoni chunks and cheese all over the inside after exploding, so cover your food!  It does a good job with potatoes (up to about 3 medium potatoes).  It does OK with defrosting but not great.  To be fair, I've never found a microwave that was ""great"" at defrosting.The bad (and really the only bad):  The turntable stopped working after a couple of years.  It just stopped rotating and that was that.  The now stationary turntable has a huge negative impact on how evenly the microwave heats.  Too bad.  I'm now replacing it, but if it weren't for that I'd still be using it.  Maybe you will have better luck."
2,This is an okay microwave. Just not as guaranteed because seems powerful very big. But doesn't heat like is says it does. Very bulky on the outside but does have a nice size inside to be able to be made for large plates and etc for my kids to be more able to be heated more at the same time. Then again Some electronics do have the pluses and minuses.
4,"Works well, heats with good intensity. The printed faceplate is a bit difficult to see - you need a good light.At first, you have to ""hunt"" for the 30-second-cooker! Have not yet tried the air-cook feature. A good purchase."
1,"I bought this microwave from Panasonic since October 5, last year, but never submit any review yet. When I got this problem, I put an empty container and ran microwave for only 1 min. for sanitize purpose. HONESTLY, IT'S ONE MINUTE EXACTLY, NO FOOD AT ALL! A sticker of cook instruction at the bottom burned, and caused damaging at door which made from plastic material. At that time I was shocked how did it happen ? Because I'm doing like this with other microwave such as SHARP, GE, etc. They never cause issue like this.After I got this issue from defected material, I tried to contact Panasonic's support at website. It only told me to bring microwave to some service centers of Panasonic. I picked one of them, dropped my microwave for repairing at A-1 TV about June 27, 2023. Then, I was waiting until today (Aug 8, 2023), I was calling to ask about my repair process. He said ""Panasonic is thinking it was caused from food burn which is not covered in warranty. This issue never happen before"" I'm so frustrated with this conclusion from Panasonic. Even it is the first time of issue, everything can be possibly happened though.I think Panasonic doesn't want to accept about defective material on their product, and try to blame to customer's fault. It's easier to save money in their pocket without customer care, isn't it? Panasonic isn't worried about customer's satisfaction, or even after-sale services. They just want to SELL SELL SELL, and TAKING MONEY, after that CLOSE THEIR DOOR. That's it.I'm not sure whether this model is flagship product line, or not. I think it's pretty high tier of Panasonic's microwave line. Because I paid $249.95. When I bought it, I expected high-end microwave to be fulfilled until the end. However it's damaged not even in one year. DISAPPOINTED A LOT. I won't buy any product from Panasonic in US again"
1,about 1 month after we got it started acting up.  it would hum but not cook.  we just dealt with it but now it is rusting out and the finish is flaking off.  would not recommend.
1,My microwave that I purchased on march 5 2022 is all rusted out
1,This oven was great for the first few months.  4 months later it got so hot you could not touch it.  Codes flashing on the display that GE had no clue what the codes meant.  HOT kept flashing on the display also.  Had to unplug.  Google the problem and it said it was an electrical failure.  After 4 months and 200.00  later.  DONOT BUY
1,Item arrived damaged. Box was not damaged. It had clearly been dropped before it went into the box. Legs would not balance. First and last time buying a small appliance from Amazon.
5,Nicer than expected and looks great!
4,So far so good...no complaints! Nicely put together and visually attractive.
1,"I hesitated buying a Panasonic microwave because I had another which was great until a little over a year after purchasing it died.  This time I bought the extra warranty.  They are really nice, when they are working.  I purchased the microwave on 2/21/20 and it stopped working on 4/1 (no April's Fool joke), no power and it displayed an H97 error.  I called Panasonic which had over a 20 minute wait time then e-chatted where they told me I would have to take the microwave to a local repair shop.  I'm in the state of Washington where there is a currently a shelter in place order.  I dont understand why Panasonic can't ship out a replacement and if they want to, I can send them back the other one.  Although, at this point I don't know if I want another Panasonic.  It has been a very disappointing and frustrating experience."
1,Microwave has stopped working less that 2 years after using it. Was heating food poorly before
4,"Settings are actually confusing.  They should have added toaster oven to the mix.  Truly wanted an all in one.  Despite the air fryer setting ie convection, it’s a super oven and use it a lot. Keeps the kitchen cooler."
5,Na
5,This microwave works great it cooks very fast.
2,"This microwave looks great and fits perfectly in a small corner in my kitchen. It also JUST fits my largest plates/bowls perfectly. However, it has a couple issues. First, the biggest, is after using it for a couple weeks microwave lunch plates (covered with a paper towel), some spots on the inside walls formed with mold. It seems that the microwave doesn't evacuate steam from the small space well (weak fan or needs to run longer?). After cleaning the inside thoroughly, I've been leaving the door open for 10-15min after each use but expect this to kill the light bulb pretty quick. Second, the buttons can be kinda hard to press and hit or miss on responding depending on where you press."
1,"If I could give it no stars I would!  I purchased this for my staff break room and in just 30 days the back warped and started making horribly loud noises when turned on.  By the time I was made aware it was past the time to return it into the trash it went.  70 bucks down the tube.  Trust me people, pay the extra 20 or 30 dollars more for a decent microwave that will last more then a MONTH!"
1,I purchased this product at the end of December 2022.  It caught on fire when using the kitchen timer yesterday.  There was nothing inside it at the time and the timer was set for 10 minutes.  Apparently it is not eligible for return.  I do not recommend this product.
3,"We returned it and got a Toshiba. With the Panasonic, to heat our dog's food on power 2, twice a day, we have to push the power button TEN TIMES! All the Panasonic ovens used the same function, so I searched Good Housekeeping and found the Toshiba - it's a little smaller, which is ok with us, but WAY quieter and very easy to use. If you want Power 5 you push number 5, you don't start at power 10 and keep pushing to power 5. We like the handle to open the door too."
1,"Ordered this microwave and it broke after a few days. Sent it back, got a replacement and broke again after a few weeks."
3,"This will be a nice item once you find out how to use it. You get zero directions on its functions.Not only that , but labels are very dark and Do Not light up. Why they didn’t backlight this is beyond me, it wouldn’t have been difficult.Honestly, if I had known any of this, I would have gone with something else."
1,"First of all, the glass plate that goes inside doesn't fit in a groove or settle into any area... Soooooo the glass plate is always off kilter and ""jumping"" around as it pushes off the side of the microwave (as the rotating arms spin around pushing it).  NIGHTMARE Microwave.The door is cheap and feels like it could break off and the buttons you have to really push to get to work sometimes.... I just hate it!  Spend a little more and get something that's worth it.  This was a total waste of money!"
5,"This is a great compact microwave that can meet all your needs. It comes with a variety of cool features from unique presets, 10 different power levels, multiphase cooking, energy efficiency mode, and a mute option that silences all beeps. This microwave oven heats up food evenly and quickly, being one of the faster microwaves I've used. I also like that it's really easy to clean the interior seemingly being stain resistant and anti-stick allowing for simple wipe downs to get off grime with little to no effort. I've been using this microwave for over a month now and have had no issues with it, only positive things to say, so I would definitely recommend this product."
2,the glass plate was broke when I opened the box
4,"When we ordered two of these we thought we'd get two identical microwaves, but this was not the case. One has a black interior and one has a white interior and they are of different wattages.. The better one with the white interior and higher wattage is great and compact and easy to use."
5,Love the look of it!
4,"I have used several Panasonic microwaves and the last one I had lasted many years but after reading many of the reviews, I was hesitant to buy another.  I appreciated all the honest views and will add mine as well.  I decided to take the risk and so far I am glad that I did.  Overall, it is a very good microwave, easy to clean, quiet, and does a great job heating foods with the sensor sitting and defrosting with the turbo defroster.  Some people said that plates were hot when using the sensor cooking, but my plates don't get that hot, I don't need a oven mitt.  Like others reported, my microwave cord is loose but so far I have had no problems with it. The only other problem area I see is the keypad is not sensitive.  Sometimes you really have to push the keys several times to get them to work. Overall, I would buy again and I think it is a good microwave."
2,Forget getting decent popcorn out of this machine.  It heats with a hotspot so part of the corn will be un-popped while another part burns. You need the box to return it.
3,"Its ok a decent microwave, im just upset i did not recieve what i purchased in the picture, the photo shows a completely silver/chrome microwave and when it arrived it had a black front face... just tacky... not too thrilled"
5,"I love it.  Like another customer reviewed it is large and I had to get used to it 's size.  It does everything it advertised and more as far as I am concerned.  We have heated up dinners, made meat  loaf in it by experimenting.  I love the way it  heats up dishes by it s vapor sense system and  beeps when the meal is done.  It takes a lot of guess work out  of cooking with a Microwave.  Defrosting items in it is a breeze.  Just follow  the instructions and you can't go wrong.  I have taken frozen roasts from the freezer and defrosted in just less than 20 minutes with the Microwave and had the Roast in the Bar B Que soon after.  Makes BBQ a lot more fun because it takes less preparation time from Freezer to BBQ.We plan to experiment with cake making which I don't know if it will happen but we are very happy with the unit.We will inform you if we have success with baking in the Microwave from scratch.Thanks for the great Countertop Microwave"
4,"Just received this a couple of days ago, arrived with a dent in the top of the microwave, which was disappointing, but tired of not having a microwave and decided to give it a try. So far the microwave works fine, just will take some getting used to on the controls, but seems fairly easy to use. It is the same wattage as my last microwave, but it seems like this one takes a little longer."
1,"This microwave quit working 1 year after I purchased it. I only used it to reheat food and make popcorn, so very little use. Very disappointing, another appliance that is going to be thrown away, because it is cheaper to buy a new one than it is to repair this one."
1,Just received this thing!  My opening is 17-1/4  Easy swap fit right.  Oh wait the unit is not 17 inches as advertised but 18 inches.  Total incompetence rears it head again.  Last RCA product I will buy.  if they cant get the dimensions right they sure as crap cant build a decent productOh just send it back you say.  Not in the cards when you got travel deadline todayThanks RCA for nothing
5,Purchased this for a college dorm room. University put a limit on wattage use. Just the right size for dorm fits on top of the mini fridge.
5,This oven has more than enough power to heat large meals and is reliably used several times per day. It has a large interior to fit any food item. The unit is also stylish for a contemporary kitchen.
1,"We were so excited to get a microwave convection combination for a decent price. However, the convection feature does not work properly. The instructions are very clear and we followed them precisely. However, the pre-heat cycle does not complete and give you the option after preheating to enter the cook time.We requested a return, which we were granted, and Amazon shipped the replacement. It arrived with both the exterior box, interior box, and the microwave itself damaged. We tested the microwave for functionality damage, and found that when you close the door, the turntable automatically engages without any cook function being programmed in.We are extremely disappointed and the original product, and an Amazon delivery for damaging the replacement. We are receiving a full refund and shopping locally for a microwave oven."
2,I use this microwave mainly to reheat beverages and food.  The first several weeks it worked fine but now I’m having trouble with it.  When I try to start it to heat something the clock just counts down - no heating.  After pushing different buttons  repeatedly it eventually starts.  It’s frustrating.  Since I was able to operate it easily before I don’t think it’s me.  I bought it because I wanted a smaller microwave.  Now I wish I had kept my larger microwave.  I never had this problem with it.
5,It’s perfect for my small apartment kitchen.  It doesn’t fit dinner plates so I fit my food on salad plates.
3,"The magnetron died without warning after only two years of use. Prior to that, this was the best microwave I've ever had. I loved the sensor cook settings."
3,Works well enough for a small microwave at a low price but you definitely need to set for longer as it’s slow to heat up food
2,"Underpowered, takes 2x longer than other microwaves. Not recommended."
2,Very low power output.
2,"Worked at first, but in less than 2 years the light bulb went out that requires a service call to replace. And then the element that rotates the platter never shuts off. It just spins non-stop.We still use it (without the bulb and with the  broken rotator mechanism). But we would never buy a Toshiba anything again. Never had a microwave/convection that broke so soon. This poor built quality about this model is all over the internet.Find something more reputable, even if it costs more."
5,5 stars
4,"Red is my fav kitchen counter color.  (Wish my elec. kettle came in red).The Microwave temp and bake time settings are so small that I needed to stick a piece of paper on the side with arrows pointing to the most used temps and bake times, and I need a flash light also just to make sure.Otherwise, It's just right.  I can fit most everything in it.  It will probably bubble after 2-3 years and  will need to be replaced but the price makes it well worth it.  (if it lasts longer than my cell phone,I'm happy. lol)"
3,"Bought this a few weeks ago and in that time have come not to love it. Wish I still had the box to return it, but I don’t.3 stars because it does heat food which is its main objective.But deducting stars because of the following:- it has plastic, not rubber, feet. Thus it slides, and slides, and slides every time you press a button or press the door button. I am having to now spend extra cash buying a rubber pad to put under every foot.- it makes a strange clicking or repeating sound.  I’ve had microwaves for decades and none have ever done this. The all hum, but this one hums and clicks- window fogs up. Never had a microwave where it fogs between the panels. Seems wrong given very old microwaves do not even do thisI wouldn’t buy again, but not throwing it out and wasting it either….that sums it up"
4,"Probably because of new technology; hence less insulation ????, when I heat something for 8 min. let's say, the exterior is warmer to touch than my former Panasonic, same microwave."
5,"The microwave itself works dood ..the airfryer is amazing,I made fish sticks and they were so crispy and good. Some remarks about the basket slipping and falling off ,it smoking and stinking. I HAD NONE of those problems. The only thing I would change is the button board is not lit ,that would be a nice plus.If you are looking for a decent combo this is great for the price and it comes with a pan and 2 stands..I would definitely recommend this microwave/ airfryer..it has another function but I have not tried it yet 😊"
3,The microwave oven was missing an important part. The plastic center piece that keeps the center glass dish from moving. I call the manufacturer and they sent me the missing part. Also there seems to be a lot of steam released from the oven after use.  Shauna
5,"1. Has the right (same) Power (wattage) when following frozen food directions. Don't have to re-calculate cook times.2. The beep is gentle, not jarring and ear-piercing like on my previous microwave oven.3. Using a door handle is better than using a push button like my previous oven had for opening the door.4. I use it with Alexa. However, the microwave oven's app is really buggy when setting-up. Had to try alternate log-on method. (Be sure to update the microwave's firmware once you do log-in in the oven's app.) Adding skill to Alexa was super easy."
4,"It's just so flimsy.  I guess I would pay another $20 for a sturdier machine.  it works fine and is so inexpensive, it fits in a tiny space.  These are all good things.  It just bugs me that it is so flimsy sounding and feeling."
5,"Five star no doubt. Just take a look around at the other choices in the stores and online and after you waste your time doing that as we did, you may very well end up right back here making this purchase. You will not be sorry...Actually we brought two other choices home from local stores and quickly realized we did not like them and had to box those up and make a return. We got lucky when we finally found this one online after searching thru page after page of other models listed before we viewed this little gem. The handle seems very well made and it cooks evenly. We have no complaints..."
3,It works a expected but is so loud.  It has a loud hum I can hear from other rooms almost to the point it is annoying.
1,"The microwave looked good and would have been a good fit for the tight space, but it would not turn on.I plugged it into different working outlets but nothing happened.  The box did not look damage or opened (original factory tape).  Waste of time and energy."
5,My previous countertop just quit in mid cycle. I really like having this size in addition to the 1100 watt overhead unit in my apt. I ordered this unit immediately and had it in two days. I had 800 watts before but see no real difference in this 700 watt. The price is good and it works.
5,"It may be small but it is mighty!  We needed a small microwave for the spot in our kitchen and this is what we picked.  It works great, heats well.  It is small but holds a dinner plate and any bowls that size or smaller.  If you want to heat a 9x13 pan this isn't the one for you.  Excellent product for the price too.  Only negative comment is the ding (bell) is really loud but GE thought of everything and you can turn off the sounds.  so now it is perfect!"
2,"I really like how simple this was to use but after only 4 months of average use, it makes a loud noise. It sounds like the turntable that is making the noise and occasionally there is smoke coming from the inside top."
5,"Had a similar Panasonic  that got old and started to flip  the breaker.  Got this new one and it works fine.  We especially like the ""reheat"" button, though we also hit the ""low"" indicator to avoid over doing it.  Be aware that after a few months we noticed a bubbling in the control panel...it was just a bubble in the film used to ship it to avoid scratches...remove the film with a piece of tape stuck to it and pull gently. It did fit nicely in our 14 inch high opening."
4,"I miss having a one push button for a quick 30 seconds to reheat coffee. Every action requires a minimum of two button pushes. Also the control panel is difficult to see once visible natural light is gone; I need my glasses and a light to shine directly on the front of the machine. Other than that, it performs its functions, tried so far, efficiently and adequately. It does seem to heat a little fast, tending to dry out frozen dinners when following package instructions, so I have learned to shave off 30 seconds from the recommended timing."
5,I got this for my son’s dorm room. He loves it. It fits perfect on top of his mini fridge. great price too!
4,"Does exactly what you would expect but allowed my roommate to put graphic mug with the words ""DO NOT MICROWAVE"" clearly marked on the bottom. Will rerate upon recall for ineffective idiot proofing."
5,"I have so far used most of the cooking functions and am happy with the out come. I highly recommend this oven if you presently do not have a convection oven in your main kitchen oven. I used the air fryer last night on frozen French Fries. I used the convection oven function to roast a six pound chicken, the night before last. Everything came out perfect.  I have baked frozen breakfast Southern Style Biscuits in the convection mode and it only takes half the time and they are perfectly brown on both  top and bottom.  For the price,  what more could you ask for. This oven is a bargain in my opinion."
5,"We’ve only had this for two weeks now, but we’re sure enjoying it. (It’s so nice to have all of the popcorn actually POP, and not have a half bag of kernels!) There’s always a learning curve and I’m sure, as always,  we’ll discover all of it’s many features! Great unit. 👍"
5,It is just what I expected!
2,"Because of 'good' reviews and recommendations, I purchased one of these for my new residence. I sent it back  because the turntable turned in a jerky motion, not smoothly like most microwaves. The next one did the same thing but since the microwave seemed to work and I didn't have time to return it, I am stuck with it. Otherwise, it does seem to work; however,  after reading even more reviews of its flaws, I am a little weary that this just might be a lemon. Since I am not at the new residence full time, yet, I haven't used this a lot, yet. I really wish I had returned this when I had a chance, but until then, I will update this review if this ends up in the trash."
5,Perfect for a college student with a small living space
4,"These are last years model, which is fine by me, it's a Panasonic and it works great. However, not only is it last years model but the ones that you see being offered for cheaper because of scratches, etc, are because of the styro-foam packing in the box. My box was not damaged in shipping but these have been boxed from the factory so long the styro-foam has made a slight change in the surface of the black plastic where it touches. It doesn't hurt the functionality but you should be aware of this.And while the base will sit in an old trim kit base, they have changed the location of the screws where they fasten to the back of the m-wave."
3,The microwave is great. Easy to use and reheats perfectly. The problem I have is that the first one came badly damaged through the USPS. The 2and one shipped the same way and was damaged again. I kept this one because the damage is on the side and doesn't show. This is too heavy to ship by mail.
5,Everything is easy to use. It’s quite easy to use ..quiet when operating
1,Started blinking on and off the 1st time I used it garbage DO NOT BUY!
4,Good item. Takes up minimal counter space.
2,"It doesn't heat up on the first try , I have to put it in twice or longer than the time ."
2,The food remains lukewarm no matter how much time it is placed in this microwave. Not worth buying although it is cheap.
2,"The convection option on this oven is terrible. I find I have to cook things for much longer than I should. For example, cooking muffins that require 350• for 15 minutes needed 375• for 25 minutes. Not satisfied with that option. Microwave works fine but I haven’t had any success with the comb option either."
2,"We have had this unit 2 months. There's no bell or alarm after the timer finishes, which is quite annoying.  Another annoyance: the timer cannot be run while the unit is cooking, although our old microwave did both simultaneously.  I then have to use my phone's timer!  Even worse is that the power button has to be pushed numerous times to go from power 10 down to whatever you want and THEN you enter the time in power set function, then push start.  Nowhere is the power level displayed so you can know the power selected is what you intended.  It should be: hit the power button, punch a number between 1 & 10, then enter the time on the key pad, then start.  The power should be displayed along with the time remaining.  Oh, and the key pad is not backlit either, so in dimmed light you'll need a flashlight to see the faint numbers/words against dark background!  Plus, this microwave runs hot and all your cook times need to be adjusted!  I really HATE this design, but it's unfortunately past the 30 days to return it or I would.  Like most other consumers today, we are fed up with steadily decreasing quality and steadily increasing prices, on everything, over the past 30+ years.  This is another example of cutting quality to increase profits.  It's more than aggravating; it is disgusting."
2,The unit was great but has stopped working correctly after two years.  It starts and then shuts off.
5,"Regarding my.9 cubic stainless steel microwave, I'm ecstatic! It's amazing how much convenience it offers to my kitchen. Imagine being able to quickly prepare tasty meals while still adding a sense of elegance to my home with the sleek stainless steel design. My buddies are equally impressed when they see it, and when we are eating our quick, hot snacks, we frequently laugh heartily together. My family also likes its effectiveness. It's more than simply an appliance; it's a lifesaver that simplifies my everyday tasks and gives my kitchen a trendy feel."
2,"I'll update after I've used the oven more --  if I keep it. But I wanted to post right away that the touchpad model is not as advertised. The listing says it has a stainless finish. The strip across the bottom in front is or looks like stainless, which is great. But the top and sides look like a sparkly silver nail polish from Barbie Does Star Trek. It's seriously unattractive. Amazon is listed as the seller; I don't know if they or Panasonic are responsible for the incorrect info, but it should be changed. Also: I purchased this item new; but when I opened the box, there were spills on the turntable."
5,"This little microwave does the trick!  Digital panel, push button door, looks nice, works great! Nice price"
4,"Did not figure out why, but I just used old one from oven I replaced."
1,I thought it was bigger than this it had to be inserted into the wall under my cabinets I guess it's going to have to do for now
2,"I bought the unit because the oven feature which I May occasionally use. However, so far I used it as the convectional oven for only three times. It took too long for pre-heat. No pre-heat setting did NOT help the matter.Normal microwave feature is good, especially when the turntable reseted itself to the original spot.Then something happened, after finish cooking and the door is opened the turntable will not stop! The next day everything stop working except the light. Unfortunately is past one year warranty.No more Toshiba for me."
5,I am really enjoying the microwave.  It is quick and heats up my food very well. Not very loud but efficient.  I hope it last a long time.
5,Was looking for an inexpensive (haha!) replacement that would fit in the space I wanted it for.  This fits the bill in both respects.  Easy to use and easy to clean.
4,The rotating tray is squeaky but otherwise we love this.
1,"After very light usage for boiling cups of water and for cooking frozen vegetables, the coating inside, along the grooved runway for the rotating wheel apparatus, began to peel - the coating bubbled and began to peel. Right now, it is bare along a 5 inch by 1 inch stretch. Very disappointed."
3,"I dislike the “tinny”, low-quality, sound and feel of the door closing., it’s like closing the door of a cheaply made car, compared to closing the door of an expensive, high quality car., a Rolls Royce compared to the cars made by Russia before the Wall came down, for example., was it called the “Volga”, or something like that?🤔, the door feels and sounds “not durable”."
2,"Looks good easy to use but cooking power sucks, I for the most part have had to add 50% more time to the cooking time to get it to cook or warm everything.I do  not recommend"
5,"Wow! Are you serious? A frozen store-bought chicken pot pie cooked to perfection in two and a half minutes? My old microwave could do it in four and a half minutes.This thing is absolutely amazing!The first time I opened the door, I didn't know whether to crawl inside or cook something. Man, this thing is roomy! You'll have no problem cooking a full casserole in this thing.I've only been using this microwave for a day, but I can already tell you that this is the best microwave I've ever owned, hands down.The inside light is more than adequate, the buttons are nice and responsive, the button that opens the door does so with ease, it'll fit whatever you need cooked, it's super powerful and cooks super fast, it's whisper-quiet when it's cooking, the beeps aren't too loud, and the price is just right. In fact, I can think of no negatives about this appliance.Not sure where the one star reviews are coming from (maybe from competitors?). To me, this microwave is sheer perfection. Best I've ever owned, at least."
2,"I like the size, the function and the power of this microwave. Bought this mainly for the button with +30s, very convenient. I’m giving two star because the first one arrived had big dents on every side and it couldn’t work. Called amz to return it because it cannot be completed online. It took me a punt 30 minutes to process because they said they have to make sure it can be fixed.."
4,"Prefect microwave, only concern is not level, and second one was the same and had to stick something under a leg to not wobble, manufacture wanted me to bring it in to a store. Lol nope"
5,Love this microwave!  It's very black & sleek looking & compact enough that it fits in a small counter top space between my stove & frig perfectly. I've never had a microwave before that had a darker interior but I love that it's a dark sort of space gray so it won't yellow or discolor as the white interiors do.  It heats foods evenly on the turntable.  The push buttons can be easily read & selected.  I would highly recommend to anyone needing a small microwave.
5,Very easy to learn to use.  But the plastic label over the control panel starting to separate.
3,"It's OK, but my prior microwave was  a GE that lasted 1996 to 2016 - this has lasted 2 yrs - if you get it buy the insurance!The door latch and switch mechanism is junk - I can't understand how a company can put out something like this - I am a Panasonic fan - the GH5 camera is amazing - but they obviously don't care about their home appliance customers to be designing something like this. Shame."
5,"microwave works well.  i can hear things reheating.  larger than i expected, but not enormous."
2,The microwave works but clearly the box was dropped or punctured while still at the factory because it was actually taped up! The microwave itself was dented on the side.
1,"I admit - a big part of my decision to purchase was the distinctive look of this microwave. Nothing else like it.But today - first day of use - I tried to reheat cold coffee, which was still cold at the end of one minute. I mean, stick your finger in it and feel the chill cold. (Oddly, it heated the cup itself to the point I needed a pot holder to move it.)Second, I tried to heat a plain cup of water for one minute. Used a different mug. The water was hot on the top, cold on the bottom. And on only this second use, the oven was twice as loud as the first time.Darn it. I love the look of this thing. But it's back to Panasonic - or maybe I'll try a Toshiba. Either way I'm really bummed."
4,"The instruction manual needs work. It's not very well written ( not well translated) and some parts are either vague or not explained well (custom defrost function, auto menu, waiting state, using ""reheat"" and ""cook"" to refer to the same thing). If you get past that you'll be fine.The oven itself is solid and well built. And it heats well and it's pretty quiet. But that instruction manual is from hunger lol."
4,Doesn’t take up much space but works really well sometimes you just have to microwave a little bit longer.
5,Just what I wanted
5,Perfect size for apartments
1,Stopped working after a couple months. Smelled like burning wire and started to smoke.
5,Exactly what I was looking for….  Great product for the money
3,Small. Hard too see the numbers for elderly.
1,"It works well, and I love the silient feature with shuting off the loud beep, beep, beep.  However, it is rusting the paint off on the inside top area about 20% so far.  I bought it 3-months ago, so I cannot return it.  Thwerefore, I just scrap off paint that is lifting off and continue to use it."
4,Great buy
4,"I replaced an LG oven that had a push button door opener, the weakest link on the whole unit and of course the thing that broke first because it's used so much. This Farberware is same size and power, but with handle for the door. I'm liking it fine, and it seems to be quieter than previous oven. I'd read some reviews here that people thought it was loud, but I haven't noticed that."
5,My wife like the microwave oven. It fit exact above the stove. Lights are led and easy to use.
4,"This microwave has a very nice look if this is what you're looking for.  We purchased it because we needed something small and wanted something unique for our outdoor kitchen, and it fits perfectly in one of the cabinets.  We have used it mostly for heating up coffee that has cooled off too much when we're out on the patio in the morning, and the 30 second button works great for that.  We also like the platter memory function that stops the rotating platter at the exact same point as it started so coffee cup handles end up easily reachable.  It's also large enough inside to fit any dinner plate that we own.  The only real downside, although not completely unexpected, is the time it takes to heat things.  We've owned a number of small microwave ovens over the years, and in fact still have one of similar wattage in a bedroom cabinet (also used mostly for reheating coffee when we're hanging out in our sitting area on a cool morning).  But the Comfee unit is clearly less powerful, and a half cup of coffee may take two presses of the 30 second button to get it fully reheated.  Fortunately, as with most 30 sec buttons, the timer adds another 30 sec every time you press it, so two quick presses and the thing is running for a minute.Bottom line:  it's cute (if you're into cute) and it's very compact, but you'll need a little patience... which seems to be in rather short supply these days!I don;t have any instrumented way"
1,"Ordered this about 10 months ago, worked well up until few days ago. Started making noises like it was burning up so I immediately unplugged it. Other reviews shows that the warranty on it will be a joke. I have bought cheaper microwaves that lasted a lot longer than this one."
3,It showed up damaged lags were bent In so it set uneven
4,"Sleek design and compact, had plenty of power. Easy to use . Looks great"
5,Muy bien
3,"I bought this 9 months ago. Last month the inside light failed. This week the buzzer stopped working. So far the microwave works and the buttons and LED work. But I don't expect it to last.The warranty is ""lifetime."" However you have to pay to ship it to the company and wait 6-8 weeks for a replacement, which may not be honored ""depending on factors such as use of theproduct, where the product was purchased, or who you purchased the product from."" IMO, this warranty is a scam."
1,Interior width is advertised as 12” width.  Actual width is ~10 7/8”.  A dinner plate does not fit in this microwave.
1,"Like another reviewer, I bought this specific microwave for the Melt and Soften features. The sticker on the inside describes how to use those settings. But when you look at the control panel, Melt and Soften are not there. The manual also doesn't include info on those features. Besides Melt and Soften, it doesn't have any of the other Auto Cook functions listed. It also either has no interior light or it was broken on arrival. It works fine as a microwave, but it's not as advertised so that's why I only gave it 1 star."
4,So far so good!Many great features for a reasonable priced microwave!
5,Had this for few months. So far doing it’s job.
4,The only thing I am disappointed about is the power but it us the same as other small microwaves.
5,"Our prior GE Microwave started acting up and instead of waiting for it to ""die"", we immediately ordered another GE Microwave.  The price was right and the product was perfect!  Why delay?"
4,"Chefman Countertop Microwave Oven 1.1 Cu. Ft. Digital Stainless Steel Microwave 1000 Watts with 6 Auto Menus, 10 Power Levels, Eco Mode, Memory, Mute Function, Child Safety Lock, Easy CleanThe microwave comes packaged in a retail-style cardboard box with photos of the products and manufacturer info on the outside.When you open the box, right on top, you have the glass turntable microwave plate, the little wheeled ring that it rotates on, and then underneath a big piece of formed styrofoam is the microwave itself, wrapped in a big plastic bag. The instruction booklet and quick start user guide are inside the microwave. We noticed that the little centerpiece that turns the glass turntable is taped down, so you're going to want to make certain to remove the tape on that.Glancing at the quick start guide, I don't see anything unusual from other microwaves. This unit is fairly simple to use, and if you've used a microwave before, I doubt you'll have a problem using this one. I like that this unit doesn't have any protruding parts, to open the door. There is a push button on the lower right-hand side, and above that are the touchpad-style controls.Weighing in at 32 lb, the microwave measures about 20 in by almost 16 in, and is a fairly short 12 in tall. 32 lb. Doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a little bit of weight to be moving around on your kitchen counter. At 1,000 wattsof output power, this microwave is powerful enough to cook pretty much anything you wish, as long as it fits inside. You have to use microwave-safe dishes inside it, of course. We like the way the touchpad has presets for commonly used foods. Baked potatoes, popcorn, pizza, veggies, hot beverages, and a reheating button mark to leftovers. Nothing in the instructions or the paperwork with it notes that it has any type of steam or moisture indicator, so you can't just slam your leftovers in and forget them, you'll still have to check them occasionally. They're also defrost buttons that can be sorted by weight or time. We didn't find the microwave to be especially noisy, comparing it to average microwaves we've had in the past, but did make a bit when in use. If you need a good compact-size microwave for simple reheating or cooking, this unit should do well for you."
5,Buen producto
4,Perfect. Love this. For single or small family  awesome
2,Weak! The things I used to cook in 3 minutes now take 6 minutes.. this micro has no power
4,"It's a microwave. They've been around for quite a while now. This one works perfectly well heating stuff up.It is kinda large in size. About 1 1/2 inches wider than our old unit. Almost 2 1/2 inches longer front to back. The old one was a 1 cubic foot unit and this one is a bit over that.Does a fantastic job with popcorn, reheating tea/coffee and leftovers. No complaints in function at all. Price was on par with other brands, shipping was fairly quick, but not the two day prime shipping that it should have been. Can't remember anything lately showing up on time.Small complaint about the feet. They are not adjustable and the unit doesn't sit quite right on a flat countertop. Other than that it's a great microwave. Just what you would expect.Buttons are a bit hard to push, makes it easy to press the wrong one while trying to put in a cooking time."
2,"You can't see your food while it's cooking.  However, you can check your reflection in the extremely shiny finish ;o)  If I had it to do over again, I'd have gotten a different one.  I like to see my food without having to open the door..."
5,"Not to big, not too small"
4,Very easy to use and doesn’t pull a lot of power. Only downside is it is a small microwave good to warm up small plates not dinner sized 10/11.
1,Had to send it back.
4,Small enough not to take up a lot of counter space. Works great
5,I don't understand why this product has bad reviews! it works perfectly! it's not flimsy and does not feel like its going to fall apart! Very well made. yes It is a bit heavy but that stands to reason considering it is a larger microwave. I can't believe the quality for the price! Just amazing! Heats food up very fast and very well. couldn't ask for a better product for the price!
3,This microwave is extremely heavy for this senior to move around. Instruction for its use is complex for just the basic heating tasks.  I should have opted for a less complicated oven.
2,Was fine until a few weeks ago.  Now the light bulb flickers and the turntable makes loud noises and doesn't turn smoothly.  I don't think customers should be expected to purchases new microwaves every 3 years.  Disappointed.
5,I also liked the Toshiba but after a couple years of light use it came on by itself and added time. Will see how this how long this one lasts
1,Received the brand new microwave with an obvious defect. Someone in production must of put the door on upside down. Looks pretty stupid.
5,"Appears to be well made. Two weeks later, so far so good. I took the film off the panel, so expect that should be fine. I had that problem with a previous microwave, so knew what to do this time around. No problems with shipping, there was no damage when I unpacked it. The only detriment is that it's a bit light and slides on the countertop, so I'll put a mat under it. It would be great to have a cookbook included, like previous ovens I've had, but that in no way is a reason to give it fewer (not less, people) stars. I expect this to last a long time, the Sharp oven I bought several years ago stopped working after 5 years. It probably just needs a new fuse, but still, I expect longer service. I haven't used the grilling feature yet, but would like to."
2,"It's a microwave. However, after only 6 months of average use, the lightbulb ceased to work! Called customer service and this unit is not designed to have the bulb replaced. Really? What genius designed this? Extremely disappointing because I bought this MAINLY BECAUSE THE BULB IN MY LAST MICROWAVE BLEW and it was an older unit so it made sense to replace. Still under warranty but could take 6-8 weeks to get a replacement."
1,"It was purchased for a small office, used maybe once a week, and still only made it about 1 1/2 years."
2,Item was dented when received
1,"I bought this microwave, for a friend, it didn’t work at all, so disappointing"
3,The most highly rated microwave I found. A few reviews questioned its power rating. I found many times food did not cook in the recommended time. Another thing I didn't like was the double click necessary to engage the cook timer. Doesn't sound like a big deal and in fact it isn't but with the flat pad I frequently miss the second connection. Again not a big deal but annoying on a regular basis.
3,"I didn't realize how small it was compared to my prior microwave. I thought having a grilling option would be good, but my family wouldn't even try it. I guess my only mistake was getting such a small microwave, but I will say it serves our purpose of defrosting and reheating food. I wish I would have chose a larger oven, because I have a bacon cooker that can fit into the oven but it will not rotate because the oven is too small! Oh well, I got what I ordered. It is great for small apartments or a single person."
2,"Horrible, worse than a hotel microwave!"
2,"This microwave is very small, it works fine but smaller than expected"
5,"This thing has been great, got rid of 2 other appliances, this one does the job of 3!Highly recommend"
3,"Its hit or miss with slow cooking.  Sometimes you set to a low power level and it cooks at full power.  And the low setting process is not intuitive or well explained on screen.  Also, half the time after you remove a finished item from the microwave and go on to the next item, it wont accept new time settings, until you press Stop to reset it.  Also hit or miss.  Im fairly tall, and i have to stand back to see the buttons.  It would help if they were backlit, and the surface area of what is accepted as a push on any button is quite small.  You have to hit the mark within the graphic button exactly on target.  Lots of times I've pressed and pressed, crouched and pressed, and then realized i was pressing correctly, but i needed to hit the stop button first.  Not a bad machine, but annoying, and thank goodness i have another one that will reliably work on low settings without worry."
5,Sleek and exactly what we were looking for.
4,"This puppy is huge and fast!  Unless you are strapped for space, get it- you will not be disappointed.  Everything you ever wanted to put in a microwave fits.  An 11x13 glass baking dish- no problem, a jar of pasta sauce- no problem, a whole turkey (would never do this)- but in this beast it is possible!.  My only annoyance is that the quick 30 seconds requires you to press quick30 AND start- most other microwaves ""quick"" will start immediately without pressing start.  A small inconvenience for all of the other advantages- just need to retrain the human."
1,"Right out of the box this is a good looking oven and appears high quality.WRONG .Miss my old microwave that I had for many years.  Since I had to replace it, I thought I would pay the extra bucks to get a multifunction appliance.  BAD MOVE. NOT ONE feature of this oven works well.MICROWAVE:  Popcorn that popped in 1 min 45 sec in my old microwave takes 4 whole minutes in this one.CONVECTION:  This oven takes 25% to 50% longer to cook foods than my regular oven.  Instructions say to preheat for 5 minutes, but Preheat takes 20 minutes.After preheat, French Fries (1 medium potato) take 45 minutes and this oven get so hot that I fear a fire could start.  Hard to believe its electric cords don't melt.AIRFRY:  (see convection, because that is what it is)  A cheap airfryer from Walmart or Amazon works much better than this.  MUCH BETTER.BAKE:  (see convection)AUTODEFROST:  works well, but check frequently and stop early or food will start to cook.SENSOR COOK: Seems to workPOPCORN:  does not run long enough to cook even half the popcorn.NOTE:  You will need a flashlight to read the button display.  So you need two hands to program.  Default for majority of the quick buttons is MICROWAVE, so don't put in airfry rack and push the wrong quick button!!!!Sadly, I would return this if I had not waited too long.  I am a few weeks past return date.  WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.I so wanted to like this oven, but this oven never should have made it past the companies quality control."
2,"I WILL say if you want a small microwave on your counter, this will fit the job. As far as heating things, you might want to look elsewhere. I had to double the time for anything I wanted to heat. After, the first go round (usually 4-6 minutes), some places were still frozen. After adding 3-5 more minutes, things were luke warm. Also, there was a strong odor that was present while it was running, not quite electrical, but definitely burned smell. I went and got the Farberware 900w and the new one isn't winning any awards for function either. Makes me wonder if I really need a microwave, or if I just got used to having one."
1,"While this microwave heats fine, fit the space we had, and looks great, every time we use it it leaves a lot of condensation on the inside of the microwave.  I suspect that this will shorten the life of the product, and it is very annoying and seems like a good setting for germ growth. I now keep a paper towel hanging from the handle to wipe this condensation up after each use.  In addition, the glass turntable dislocates frequently, requiring taking everything out and resetting it. Wish we hadn't bought it."
1,"This microwave cuts off the power to my home sometimes when I use it. This is the third time it has cut off the power to half my house. It only happens with this appliance in particular. I have run multiple other appliance through the outlets and circuit breaker path this was attached to without this problem. This is marketed as an ECO friendly low power microwave, yet it blew the power in my house 3 times. It is an extreme point of frustration in my life as of recent. Owning this appliance has been a complete disaster, and actually lowered my quality of life."
5,"This is a great solution to save counter space.  No need for a separate toaster oven, air fryer and microwave on your counter.  So far I have toasted bread and made some cheese melts, so this looks like it is going to be a great addition."
5,It works really well.
5,"Only two person use. It’s the perfect size if you’re looking for a small microwave that doesn’t take up much room. The packaging was done really well as I was concerned about a broken plate, but it’s packaged really nicely!"
3,Hard to use. I have to push the buttons so hard the microwave slides all over the counter. I usually have to hold the back to be able to push hard enough to get a result. I would not recommend.
4,Love it but the bacon never comes out he same and I don't know why
5,"Easy to use.  Fits on countertop, cleans up great"
5,I liked the smaller size. It is attractive. It has a 30 second function. But boy is it noisy. Fan is loud. Also it does not stop beeping when you open the door at the end of cooking/heating time. When using late at night that is inconvenient.
1,Would never purchase this brand again.
5,"This microwave initially came with a placement hole off set but it was quickly and easily replaced. Once I verified the next one's placement holes were on point, It was just a matter of a few minutes to place it above my range. I did have to get my son to help me hold it up while screwing it in, but very easy installment overall. Works great as well! The exhaust sucks up any smoke from cooking, the light illuminates what you're cooking, noise level is minimal, and the 30 second start button is great! I would recommend this item."
5,"A lot of the smaller microwaves you can pickup for under $50 are inexpensive for a reason. They lack wattage and the better features. This little microwave offers more features and a higher level of quality.The housing and ""feel of the controls feels sturdy and well made. Looks good too. It comes with a variety of presets and options including multi-phase cooking which allows you to program two levels of power in one cycle. This could be useful for defrosting and heating at the same time. I like to heat and eat frozen sausage and egg croissants which come out chewy if just heated. Multi-stage can defrost it at low power for a minute then heat it for another minute making it come out as it should.It also has a handy stand-alone timer feature. Using the timer feature is easy enough unless you want to time something for less than ten minutes. In this case, you need to press the 0 button until the minutes or seconds are displayed before entering the number of minutes or seconds you want to time. Just pressing the 1 will start it at 10 minutes.This little micro-wave has all the standard pre-sets like popcorn, potato, and beverages along with a clock, time or weight defrosting and the ability to change power levels. I particularly like the +30 second button that starts cooking instantly and increments my 30 seconds every time you press it. I probably use this more than any other feature. the microwave comes with a 1 year warranty.I compared prices of 900 watt / 0.9 cubic feet microwaves and found this one to be about average but it seems to be of a higher quality than some and has more features. I have to give it five stars."
1,The buttons do not work on the control panel. Some of the buttons intermittently worked the first few days then got progressively more frustrating and have now completely stopped working.
3,"I was disappointed in Toshiba's Customer Service and policy. The microwave, whichseems to function well, came with the glass tray totally unwrapped. Whenwe opened the box, the glass tray fell out and shattered.Toshiba said it was not responsible, as the tray was not broken when it arrived.We had to purchase another glass tray on our own.  Very poor public relations"
4,"We bought this Toshiba and it works. But the one thing you should be able to do easily, you cannot, and it is not obvious why.  Our first meal was oatmeal.  The cook time needed is one minute thirty five seconds.  To select 1:35 is an absolute puzzle that we did solve after a half hour of pushing buttons.  Solution:  PAY ATTENTION NOW.  Press cook time TWICE [once will give you 0:00] and that will not let you put in a specific cook time.  Press it TWICE and it will provode the four zeroes 00:00.  Then you can punch in 1:35, or anything else you want.  If you do not follow this procedure of two presses on cook time, No matter what you try to press, the first number you key in WILL START the machine AND GO WITH THAT NUMBER IN MINUTES!  What a mess this keypad is for an otherwise outstanding oven."
2,"We got this to get more counterspace since we had microwave and separate air fryer.  Don't bother. It isn't an air fryer.  It takes over 30 minutes for what takes 10 in a real air fryer, and just not as crisp.  The microwave is LOUD and we mainly use it to reheat coffee, it takes 50% more time to do it than our old one.  So this unit is in the donate pile, and our old stuff is back on our counter.  Don't waste the money"
3,Didn’t receive instruction booklet
5,"This is a housewarming gift for my son. He reported it arrived damaged, the door wouldn't open and close as it should. The box was also damaged. We requested return authorization, and a replacement. The replacement arrived a day or two later, and my son returned the damaged product. I see the return is complete. An upsetting situation was smoothly resolved. Amazon rocks."
4,"Its cute and has worked well over the past 3 weeks. It does a good job heating food. As some of the other reviewers mentioned for the retro looking microwave , things can get complicated for those who aren't very ""tech/microwave savy"" aka when my geriatric parents are trying to use it."
4,Excellent cooking.  5 stars cooking.  Only drawback is obnoxious beeper that can't be silenced. Negative 1 star sound.
5,This is a perfect size for my small kitchen plus nice and quiet.  It has been working well and was easy to use right out of the box.
4,The buttons are dark and hard to see/read
1,"Keypad froze intermittently. Oven light directed outwards, not into compartment so food could be seen. Leg pads not level. Fascia and door not aligned with body of oven, door loose on hinges. Noisiest nuke I've ever had. Easy refund and return were the only positive aspects to buying this piece of trash."
1,"Purchased this unit, put it on my boat.  Fit and looked great.  Since it's on the boat we didn't use it for a month or so after the initial test use and now that I can't return it via Amazon it's proven (very) defective.  After popping a single bag of popcorn, it now blows it's own internal fuse after running for two to three seconds (I replaced the fuse several times to test it).  So i have a $100 bag of popcorn and a brand new microwave-shaped paper weight.  Am thinking shipping it for repair will be pretty expensive and may just try to give it to a local shop to get rid of it."
1,Lasted 2 years and 3 months.  RIP Farberware.  The key pad just stopped working.  Randomly.  Went to Best Buy and picked up a new Sharp microwave.  Hoping this one lasts longer!  Not thrilled with the short life span.
3,"I bought this microwave because it was small, the inside dimensions looked like they'd work for us, and because it was cute and unobtrusive. In person, it checked all those boxes. However, it took twice as long as the longest time recommendation on a bag of microwave popcorn to do the job, and about three minutes to properly heat a cup of cold coffee. Maybe we wound up with a dud, since I don't see many other reviews mentioning lackluster heating performance, but we wound up sending ours back."
2,Sending back ASAP…can’t trust “operation” if arrived with used/damaged exterior…Obviously used to some degree but sold as new
5,This guy really does the trick.  It will cook anything you put in it evenly and does a great job with defrost.  It has all the presets you will need and is a breeze to clean.  One minor issue:  I wish it had the door had a push latch for one finger opening instead of having to grab the handle with your hand.
5,This item works good so far.
5,Great micro for $
3,It was smaller than expected and for the price I was slightly disappointed. But he’ll it’s good enough for a regular heft size plate. Even the heavy duty size fits
3,"A lot of extra button pushing, that really isn't necessary. Other less priced brands are easier, why? How does it cook? like any microwave, though maybe as we get used to it we will find something outstanding about it. Am I tired from button pushing? No I'll live. What would be the reason to send it back? Noise. This thing is loud! Fan noise, sounds like a street sweeper or a jet starting. Hard to converse with it on. Maybe we'll adjust."
3,Low power takes long time to microwave things and poor performance. NOT RECOMMENDED.
4,I like that it is similar to my old microwave even though the inside is smaller.
4,Great for office or dorm room. Perfect to warm up a full playe of food.
4,"Amazon made it right by giving me a partial refund. The appliance is otherwise usable, just no clock."
5,"Easy to use, easy to set power levels"
1,Worked 4 months and wont heat at all now
2,"Flimsy button to open the door, lack of Express Cook functionality, and especially: Annoying loud beeps when cancelling cooking before time runs out, as well as when resetting time to zero.  Regarding this last point (the annoying loud beeps)... Panasonic, there is no need to have loud, annoying, extended beeps ... because in both these user operations (cancelling cooking, and resetting time) THE USER IS RIGHT THERE AT THE MICROWAVE DOING IT ON PURPOSE! There is no need to make the rest of the household hear that!  If this is user configurable, then let me know, I will update this review to be somewhat softer."
1,"I wish I had listened to the other bad reviews, but thought I would take a chance on a brand I thought was reputable. we've had this microwave for around 2 months and yesterday it started not working. at first, we were confused-- why is the food not warm? maybe we should try it longer? maybe the plate is wrong (??) basically we couldn't even entertain the idea that a microwave that was ONLY 2 MONTHS OLD could already be broken!! our last microwave lasted 16 years. NOTHING IS BUILT TO LAST THESE DAYS, ESPECIALLY NOT THIS GARBAGE MICROWAVE!EDIT: amazon is providing a refund but withholding $20 from the original purchase. why? I should be entitled to a full refund. it makes no sense I am being penalized $20 because amazon sent me a defective product. would give zero stars for customer service if I could."
4,So far so good although we've only been using it for a few months. Economical and does what it says it does. No issues so far to speak of. Would consider giving it 5 stars over time if it holds up to its billing.
5,"Very pleased with this microwave!  1200 watts strong it will cook and defrost quickly and the Sensor cook numbers are very easy to view once you open the microwave door and allows for perfect cooking of many foods!  Looks very nice in the kitchen, highly recommend!"
5,This is a multifunctional microwave and does a decent job in heating and cooking certain items. The stainless steel is quite sleek and easy to clean. You can add these as an extra one for basement dining or outdoor kitchen kept under cool areas. It can be programmed and does a lot of different targeted heating specific to different meats and food groups. Heats up fast and no set up required.
2,"At first, I really liked this microwave. However after using it a couple months, and not overusing it— just normal use— it makes a horrible rattling sound like the wheels on the ring that make the plate rotate are not working properly. It vibrates and makes such a loud, unpleasant sound. I tried older plates and wheels I had saved from older microwaves that stopped working and it doesn’t matter. It just sounds horrible. Like nails-on-a-chalkboard annoying. I wish I could return it and get something else. So disappointed."
4,"Our microwave had to be thrown out when the protective seal between the door and microwave literally fell off onto the counter top! I could see rust where the protective paint was supposed to be! I researched and I read that this is what keeps the radiation from leaking out - so discontinue use immediately! That was unsettling! So we unplugged it and got on Amazon to find another one. I really thought I could find one that does not have paint there. Maybe one that has stainless steel there instead. I only found one and it was way out of my price range. So I looked and looked and looked. One thing I have learned about appliance reviews is that not everyone uses kitchen appliances the same. So after many hours of searching - I went with this one. My old one was really big - so I wanted something smaller to gain counter space and one that matched all the other appliances. We only use the microwave for popcorn and warming up stuff. So I don't need anything fancy. I also wanted this fast and it was prime. I ordered it and the 4 year replacement since our old one did not make it that long.  It did not come on time!  The day after I bought it, I got an email stating that it would not be here for four more days! I was not thrilled with this but I did not want to search for another one. It came packaged well. It is smaller than I am used to. But everything I ever use in the microwave - fits. The sides are black - all sides. Only the front of the microwave (the door) is stainless. It is quieter than our old one.  It has a good time cook and a defrost that works well. It has a bright led light inside. The best part for me is the size! I was able to move it to a different part of my kitchen and I gained a lot of counter space! Which is just what I wanted! If you want a no frills microwave and are concerned about space - buy this!"
1,"This microwave worked fine for a 14 months, then it had a h98 failure. (It is not heating, and it shuts off after 20 seconds, even if I set it for a minute.) It failed 2 months after the warranty expired. There is a 5 year limited parts warranty on one of the parts (which is likely the failed part according to the error code). It doesn't seem cost effective to pay to send them the microwave so that they can send you a part for free so that you can do the repair or pay someone to do the repair. This expensive a microwave ought to last longer than 14 months, and the warranty expiring just before it failed makes it seem like they know about this issue and haven't fixed it."
1,"Bought this in February for my husband and I, bought another in March for my father, and it turns itself off and on, the light looks like is is shorting and the control panel is melting. Returned it as dangerous yesterday. Amazon ROCKS!"
1,"I bought this back in 2020. Never would I have thought the microwave wouldn't even last 3 years. It'll be 3 years in April. I went through so many loops to contact Farberware. Their website claims that they have a limited lifetime warranty. Oh but only on their cookware, but wouldn't a microwave fall under this category? The website is very deceiving and the support was awful. I won't be supporting a company who has deceiving information, terrible customer service and products that are built to break."
2,I am giving it two stars because the quality is mediocre at best. The handle broke off after 14 months of normal use. I double checked and we don't have any super heroes in our house that normally rip handles off of things.
4,"Bought this for size. Added incentive was to have dish stop in same spot as started. Didn't work. Realized I loved a feature of the old one where I could read the controls with out extra external light. These controls are black on black. Irritating for me. Aside from that, works fine."
1,Inside of microwave bubbled and paint came off
1,"Purchased a black unit based on the review score but when I unboxed it the door and trim had markings that would not wipe off with a damp cloth, almost as if it was a used unit.  Box did not seem opened but needless to say this is going back for a replacement.  At first I thought it may have had that protective film on it but not the case.  Feels very light vs. my old unit (which lasted 20 years) a Kenmore Elite.I will update my score once the new unit arrives and I have had a good 10 months use with it.UPDATE:  second unit arrived with the EXACT same issues.  Why this does not ship with protective peel it off layer is beyond me.  Back it goes.  Last 3 pics are the second unit."
4,I just got the microwave yesterday and used it a few times. So far I like the easy one press button to cook. I noticed the glass turn plate is really small compared to my old toshiba. The outer part of the machine is the same size as my old machine but the inside is significantly smaller! How odd.
3,The Timer does not work correctly.  Was able to use the unit by selecting Cook and then put in the amount of time to cook and then push start/off.  If I used the timer function it would take the time and then count down for a few seconds and cut off.  Microwave  would not turn to heat but does if I use the cook button function..
5,Bought for son. He loves it.
4,"I like the overall design of the microwave except for the light and the beeper.  The light is white Led, I prefer warm white Led light because it's brighter. The beeper is not a beeper. It's some frivolous sound that you can barely hear especially if you're watching TV or a distant away.And there's no reminder to let you know after a few minutes that the food is in the microwave"
4,It is a little small but works great for what I need and fits well on my counter.
1,"I never write reviews but I don’t want anyone to waste money on this like I did. My husband bought this for me for Christmas and it’s already stopped working. That’s less than five months and we don’t use it excessively or anything like that. It gets used maybe 3 times a week for normal things (steaming veggies, heating leftovers, etc) It already stopped working on me once at the 3 month mark and after viewing various troubleshooting tips and websites, I was able to get it to work. It worked for another month then today quit working completely. I don’t recommend wasting your money on this at all!!I wanted to add that it was still under warranty so I reached out to the company and that was another issue in itself. First off, they had told me that they only had one facility in Texas that handled the repairs of their smaller appliances. I was fine with that, so they shipped me an empty box so that I could ship the product back to them. The address that they were having me ship it to however was in Florida and I ended up having to call them again to verify that it was going to the right place because I was told there was only one facility in Texas. I was informed it had been moved to Florida. I sent the product back in the middle of May. I never received any type of confirmation or anything from them that they even received it. Months went by with no word from them. I didn’t even know if it had made it to the right place. We eventually just broke down and bought a $50 Hamilton Beach microwave because we weren’t sure when ours would be back or if it even would be coming back. One day in November I came home to a big package and it was the microwave. I plugged it in to make sure it actually was fixed and then stuck out in storage because at that point we already had the other microwave and it was working great. I just wanted add a warning to people about my experience with the warranty process. I will never not another product from this company. It’s just been a bad experience all around."
3,"The instructions (both printed and on line) were sorely lacking.  I have yet to use all the functions until I master the microwave portion.  You need to put the food in ""exactly"" the right place before it will turn on, often getting the message ""food"" meaning it didn't recognize there was anything inside.  Possibly a design flaw or possibly a damaged unit?"
1,Not worth buying.Seller is useles to make amends.
1,"First, it came without the user guide and you can't find one easily online.  Second, the release button would not allow the door to open.  Third, tried contacting Chefman's support and got an automated response that it will be 5-7 business to get a response.  So we are unable to use it and will have to return it.  Disappointed as we really wanted it to work and waited extra days living without a microwave to receive this model:-("
4,"When I was looking for a new microwave I read the reviews and one of the frequent complaints was the plastic coating on the ""buttons"" -- The reason I have to confess is I did try to remove the plastic coating and I finally gave up thinking the people who wrote the reviews were right -- why would they put this coating over the buttons? she asked. Well yesterday after using the microwave pretty much every day to warm my dogs food, the plastic sheet that obviously was on their to protect the buttons until purchased, finally curled and I peeled it off. Feeling really silly about now but I swear I even tried to get that coating off with a knife at the corner. The ""keys"" or ""buttons"" or whatever you want to call them are all pretty and shiny and look like new! Good grief!"
2,"Food is heated very unevenly. The surface of food becomes super hot but the bottom stays cold. We used to use an over the range microwave at our apartments and it’s much better than this one. Our habits and utensils did not change, so we concluded that this microwave just isn’t able to perform its basic duty. There was even once that a small bowl of veggies were burnt, and this never happened before when using the apartment microwave."
5,"I needed a small one. This ticked all the boxes and even tho its only 700 watts, it heats up plenty quick enough.  Also a very reasonable price."
2,"This microwave looks fine, but when I took it out of the box it was clearly not as big inside as the description says. The turntable is only 10 inches. Sadly, it did not fit my 11inch plates. I put it right back into the box  and returned it."
4,"Solid, does what it's supposed to do, fairly quiet, good price compared to appliance stores."
2,"After about 2 months it started make a grinding noise and popping noises and I had hardly used it. They know how to make the outside look good, but seemingly don't care about the mechanics. Sadly I bought this to replace a GE microwave that literally lasted 30 years with No problems. I don't know what to buy now because I read that most, if not all, microwave ovens are made in the same shop/company in China.  Just put different brand names on them, I guess."
5,Very nice and simple microwave.
5,"I have this microwave in my home office to warm up my coffee and other hot beverages.I have warmed up food in it but I haven't cooked anything. This was my intended use. It has nice lines and good function.I liked it so much I bought one for my son who had to be quarantined in his room for 10 days (he shares a house elsewhere). He needed something small but mighty enough to warm up soups and make ramen, etc.We are both pleased with our microwaves. I trust the Farberware brand...as I have pots and pans from when I got married almost 37 years ago and still use them. I was thrilled when I saw they made microwaves. I researched this and saw the good ratings and the price was right. A good value."
5,Easy to use and easy to clean
5,They say they liked very much
5,We are very happy with our purchase. The item meets all our expectations ! An efficient micro-wave oven that takes a small space on our kitchen counter. Thank you for accurately representing this item in your description.
1,"The media could not be loaded.I bought this mocrowave less than 6 months ago, and its NEVER been used to cook ANYTHING... Its only been used to re-heat coffee and other beverages, and has never been ""On"" more than 2 minutes at a time. This appliance SHOULD NOT BE SOLD by amazon, as it acutally caught on fire internally. If i hadnt been standing in front of it, and jerked the plug from the socket, it would have undoubtedly caught my home on fire. The unit wouldnt even shut itself off, when i opened the door.The video i uploaded shows what it did, and what i will do to you as well, if youre foolish enough to purchase this DANGEROUS appliance. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!?"
4,You are on your own when setting it up for use. For example the meager instructions callouts don't match the item names on the control panel.
1,Only had it a couple years and lightly used the digital display is burning out.  The air fry function is difficult to figure out. No reference to it in the manual.  Very disappointed.
4,"I researched microwaves and this one came back as highly rated.  It is rather compact (side to side and top to bottom (a plus) but it is surprisingly DEEP (probably also a plus, but affected the placement in a walk in pantry application).  I have only used a few features thus far.  The sensor reheat (a must have microwave function) seems to work well (a plus)."
1,"Th enamel coating flakes off.  We only had this microwave for less than 4 years, under light use."
3,"I had to throw this product out, unfortunately and even though it was so useful to me because it became noisy after a while. I literally became scared to use it because it had began making a weird noise after approximately 4 months. I placed it on my counter and didn’t love it around really but I noticed that the noise came from the metal piece which helps the plate circulate. I never had this issue with my previous microwave.  Although I need to reorder a replacement it will not be from Amazon because that was a waste of money for me and I don’t trust that it won’t happen again."
4,I have only had it a couple of days but seems to work good. The only down side I have so far is there is no 30 button. I really like that on my other microwaves so that is a bummer. it is smaller than my old one but this ok as the other one was a little big for where I need to put it.
2,"Microwave just arrived. I was skeptical about purchasing an appliance online, but I figured why not?After reading the instructions and plugging it in, I tried to set the clock time and the only buttons that work are 1, 2, 3, and 6, and those only went through after pressing really hard. The other buttons don’t register no matter how hard you press the buttons.Definitely not an ideal situation, returning this product immediately and getting one in the store."
3,The time cook button and power level button were not easy to use.  I thought it would last longer than  2 1/2  years.
4,Ok so I cant say I dislike the size. I just didnt look at the size on thd buy page. It is smaller then I wanted. I'm also not going to send back because I'm the dumb. But finding out you can mute the beeps is great. I get home at work 11pm so its great to not wake people up. It also doesn't make a whole alot of noise anyway. All in all it's a decent microwave for the money.
3,"I like this microwave. It doesn’t take up a lot of counter space, it’s cute, and it’s red which matches my other appliances, but unfortunately, the roof of the interior has started to peel and bubble and I’m nervous it’s a safety hazard, so it’s going in the trash soon. I admit I could have cleaned it more and I’m reading online that food not wiped up can splatter and create hot spots resulting in peeled and bubbling paint but I can’t say for sure that’s what caused it. I also have noticed these last few weeks that condensation builds up on the inside of the microwave door and a cloud of humidity wafts out every time I open it when it’s done cooking and I’m reading online that this can be due to poor ventilation or a faulty fan, which I’m seeing now is an issue in other low-star reviews for this product, and looking online, condensation can also cause peeling and bubbling paint over time, so as a person who isn’t an expert, I am obviously searching for reasons for the peeling and bubbling interior paint. I do this because I’ve never owned a microwave that has paint that has bubbled or peeled in its interior. And I’ve owned at least 4 microwaves before this. My only solution is to discard this one, and buy a different brand of microwave next time. It’s too bad because it’s very attractive in my kitchen."
2,Farberware used to be a brand you could rely on.  Right out of the box it would make funny buzzing noises but it seemed to work so I kept it.  At the one year mark it started really buzzing loudly with snapping and arc-ing inside with lights flashing.  It's going in the trash where it belongs.
5,"We ordered this two times before.  The first time the box sounded like broken glass.  The second time, the glass made it, but the sheet metal on the front was bent up badly when it was put in the box.  The third time it arrived in good shape.  I'm not sure it was the same vendor the third time.  We have been reticent to use the convection feature, since we only have about 2-3"" clearance to the cabinet above.  12"" is recommended, so I'm not sure we'll use it that way.  We would have gotten a plain microwave if we had been aware of that.  It sticks out about 3-4"" further from the wall, so there is a tradeoff.  However, I didn't want to downgrade it for that reason.  It seems fine as a microwave, although, like many, it dings more than seems necessary.  It is good looking--for a kitchen appliance."
5,We love it
1,"Don't buy this!!Absolutely loved this microwave for the past 8 months until just now. Giving it a little inside wipe down when suddenly I feel and hear something not good. I turn my head sideways looking up and take a peek to see a spots where the paint has just bubbled and was about to fall off revealing the metal and rust! I have had cheap under $100 microwaves that lasted years and this one lasted 8 months! $300 for 8 months! About to check warranty and if gone try to sand and repair it with appliance paint for a short while but this just baffles me. Fyi, it's been on my counter not near any heat or moister source so this really is absolutely horrible. My microwave manufactured date on the label isn't even a year old!!Do NOT buy this microwave!!"
2,"The metal grid inside the door has a dent. It's inside the door (in it's interior), not on the outside or inside.  Returning and will order once more hoping for no damage."
5,"It is a great microwave, for what I need it for is perfect and price was decent"
4,"It was gift for my house Warner gift,"
3,When I received it there was a large dent in the bottom left side. It works fine. Because it's so heavy I don't want to struggle with it to repackage and ship back. As I said it works. But I'm not happy paying what I did for it and it coming with a big dent in it.
4,I enjoy  the use of the microwave that I had and sure I will enjoy the replacement of the first one sent that had a defect in the window. The replacement was late arriving as stated but came the next evening for some reason.
5,Perfect size not to big
5,"We purchased this relatively inexpensive, and very compact unit to use until our kitchen remodel was completed and we could replace it with a more expensive and ""Better"" unit. However, it proved to be so useful, and so efficient, that we simply kept it as our full time microwave. We have found that for our uses, we have no need for a larger or more expensive unit. the interior size of this machine is almost a large as our previous unit, but it is fully 20% smaller in the space it takes up on the counter, while having all the feature we have ever needed and used. It is also very good looking and its black and stainless exterior complements our new kitchen decor. Frankly I am amazed. In fact it is quieter and easier to clean than the larger and much more expensive machine it replaces. I certainly recommend this machine."
5,Don’t dislike anything. I love this microwave.
2,"The size is ok but it’s just to light and can’t even open the door unless I hold it back with my other hand holding it back. Also the turn table needs redesign as the center plate moved off center with slightly little movement, and it’s not easy putting the plate back on center."
4,I love this microwave. I love how it turns back to where you originally set your glass or mug in.  The air fryer works great the only problem is the plate is too small for an average sized pizza so I just bought a pizza Pan and set it on that. also the instructions for the air fryer...... there are none.  If I had that it would be perfect.
5,My wife is very short and cannot reach her microwave. I bought this to replace my air fryer and to have a microwave she can reach. This is an awesome machine.
4,"This seems to be a good microwave for the money I spent.  Ten days ago, my 24-year old Kenmore microwave sparked and smelled burnt while I was heating up my lunch.  So it went out in the trash.  I needed a new one that was no bigger than my old one and preferably a little smaller and I found this one on Amazon.  The kitchen in my condo is small and the microwave sits in a corner.  The size is perfect for that space and it has a nice sleek look.  Be advised that the inside is pretty small though.  Not a problem for me but it could be for some people.  It does a good job of warming up food quickly.  It's quiet when it runs and I've not had a problem with the turntable coming loose from the plastic ring like some people reported.  But I've only been using it for one week.  The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the microwave wobbles when I open the door.  I did not have that problem with my old one.  This microwave is definitely more cheaply made than my old one but what isn't cheaply made these days?  I expect it to last a few years and then need replaced.  In the meantime, it seems to be a good microwave for a reasonable price."
1,We thought we were buying a quality microwave. Normal use for three years and it’s fried. The inverter technology is over stated. It heats like any other microwave I’ve ever used.
3,"First unit was dented, and the second one had a super buzz when on microwave function. I really wanted to like this, but I can't always leave the kitchen while the microwave is running."
1,"I first bought a med-size microwave....Liked it because you can turn off the beep (that always drove my dogs crazy) however, after a several months it started making a bunch of noise coming from the vent on the side. I figured it must be the motor and was too afraid to continue using in case a fire insued...So, after a year or so, I thought let me try the smaller version and after a few months the same thing happened...really was not a happy camper and unfortunately now I don't have one and can't return it because the date expired...Don't bother with this product...A big disappointment..."
4,"Had to replace a GE microwave that died after 12 years. I had never heard of this brand before. Took a chance. But, so far, I'm very pleased. Haven't owned it for more than 30 days, but it's efficient and easy to operate. The only CON I find is the cheap, thin glass base has to be positioned purposely so it rotates."
4,"This is a large microwave, both interior and exterior.  Easy to clean and heats food up quickly.  I took away one star because on occasion, the turntable inside doesn't rotate, was purchased 2 1/2 months ago."
2,The product works ok but after a couple of months it takes time to heat the food well. I purchased the product April  of 2020. After a year the product starts to spark & decided to stop using it.
4,Just the right size for small spaces
2,I wanted to love this microwave but i just don't.  The air fryer/ convection oven settings take forever like 20mins for chicken nuggets and even the microwave part just isn't as powerful as i thought it would be. We had an 800w microwave before and this one takes longer to cook. Its also eay bigfer than i thought it would be. Thing is massive
3,This microwave worked well but only lasted 3 years.
2,The right side is smashed.... I would like to return but I need a microwave.  It works fine so far but who knows if it will continue to work. I was very upset at first but learning to live with it.
4,"I think they should have made it about 3inchs higher, cann't put my bone in ham to cook."
1,I got this microwave and immediately discovered it was not what I expected.  I returned it the next day.  I am still waiting for my refund three weeks later.  It was supposed to be back in my account 7 days later.
2,"Works great but the clock is off every day by quite a bit. Reset it and a day later the time is way off. Oh well, I just don’t look at it for the time."
5,"Of course was apprehensive when ordering a microwave on the internet!  (a first)  Always preferred to see it in person and check it out.  Delivery was prompt but left without a doorbell ring so don't know how long it was out on our front porch in plain view for porch pirates to run off with.  We muscled the box inside and the crating was very well done to protect the merchandise.  Set it up on our stand and from minute one we LOVED it!  The look, the bright light inside, the door handle, the easy use instructions.  Can't say enough about this product.  The ""chime"" sound that rings when the food is finished heating is so very pleasant and chimes only once.  Love the 30 second pad and the numbers for longer heating are so easy to read and use.  HIGHLY recommend this !!"
4,"We've only had this NN-SN6865 Microwave oven for a few days.  First impression, the fan is LOUD.  I can hear it from all around the house.  Hopefully the trade-off will be long life because the components inside will be kept cool.  Second impression, I did not realize that there wasn't a ""Beverage"" button on the control panel.  There's no ""Beverage"" setting in the programming, none in the manual, none I could find online.  I even called Panasonic ""support"" only to be told that they could not advise me how to heat beverages.  Without a doubt, beverages (left-over coffee, forgotten tea, etc) make up a good 1/3 of my microwave use.  I ended up testing mugs of water with a timer and thermometer to determine how long to set the machine to run.  I make M/W popcorn twice a year, but my cold coffee, that's every day!  Really miss that button.  This is my second Panasonic M/W, and the first one had a beverage button, too bad the thing died after about 11 years.  Hope this one lasts at least that long."
4,This is a decent microwave.  it works great and is easy to operate.  It feels like it’s well-made and should last a long time.
1,"My microwave/air fryer was delivered on 12/29/22.  As of 6/7/23 it has no power at all.  It's not my outlet because other electronics work in the same outlet.  I thought being a GE this would last, but not even 6 months.  Very disappointing."
4,"Love it, however there are 2 reasons I didn't give it 5 stars:1. Hard to see panel2. No ""One Touch Start"""
3,"when you push the door open button, the whole microwave moves, it's on the same microwave cart my old one was & it never moved.  I've had to push this up against the wall to stop it from moving.  I should also state, it works very good, and the user book is well written, it’s just a matter of learning how to operate."
3,You have to 'help' the door open when you push in on the door open button.
4,It's small and that's fine with me.
5,No issues
4,"I got it on a special deal of the day only paying about $84 for it so I can't complain about the price. It works fine but at 700W I always have to add time for cooking directions as most frozen dishes, or other items are based on using a 1200W Microwave. I don't have to add a lot of time, but say if it says 4 minutes, I leave it in for five etc. It does require more space than you'd think, so be sure you check the specs for safety, one side they ask for a 4 feet clearance, not sure why, I gave it two and it seems to work without any issues. You'll also have to remember NOT to put things on top of it (you should have about a 10"" clearance above it, and at least 3 to 4"" behind it. That worked okay on my counter. I have a very limited income so when my old Sylvania died (after giving me some 23 or so good years), another 700W, I had to find an inexpensive replacement and this was it.There is something that I find annoying. When I want to set it to a certain time, I'm so accustomed to just pressing 150 for 1 minute 50 seconds... but if you try that with this machine, as soon as you hit the one, it will begin a one minute timing no more no less, and you'll have to stop it, and go the longer way. You must push the timer button up top first, when four 0's appear, THEN you can enter you 150, or 430, or whatever not an even minute timing you wish.It has a nice glass revolving tray inside. I use covers for all of my dishes because microwaved items give off a lot of water vapor since it is the water molecules it stimulates. This is what eventually killed my old machine. I didn't realize all that moisture was just sitting on top of the inside of my microwave and eventually it rusted. (Yes, of course I regularly cleaned my microwave; but since it rarely got dirty or showed spillage, there might be a week or more before I'd wipe it down. Now I know that by having fairly inexpensive plastic covers (1 large and one small) they will trap most of the steam on them, and a quick wipe across the top of the inside, should keep it from eating away at the metal surface. Anyway, it's a good buy for the price, it works well. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the MUCH higher priced microwaves--but it does do the job."
5,"This is the best microwave I gotten yet.  Price was very reasonable.  Love the reheat feature,  now my guy aren't leaving it one.  Reheat perfectly."
1,I brought this microwave due to the size and price. I had Amazon credits from my credit card. I now have to purchase a new microwave because it is terrible. I had to hit the popcorn button 3x just to make 1 bag of popcorn. Reheating 1 normal size place of food takes 6-7 minutes. Please don’t waste your money. There are better options at your local stores for the same amount of money
1,"Bought this in December. It broke a week ago! Simply quit! Never used much, as its just husband and I, not like we used it a lot. Would not recommend. Also note, its not easy to clean if yo get something spilled. Tight corners. Wouldn't have minded much if it kept working."
2,It takes longer to heat than other microwaves I have had even compared to my lower watt microwave. It also seem to have a shortage right in the middle of cooking it flashes like there is aluminum in there. It is like an electrical discharge. It scares me. I believe I may have gotten a bad one. It is Amazon's choice so it must have been one of a kind.
5,"I've read about Panasonic microwave ovens for years.  They are truly ""different"" than other microwaves, in that they use inverter technology to modulate (turn down) the microwave energy as needed to cook different types and quantities of food.  In most microwaves the power is either on full blast or off.  Panasonic microwaves turn down the power from a level ten down to a one smoothly and continuously. This greatly eliminates hot and cold spots in food, cooked and uncooked, ensuring that everything is done evenly and to near perfection.  I use mine for popcorn, and it cooks it to perfection with its pre-programmed popcorn button.  This unit has a sensor that monitors both heat and the humidity given off by food so that its computer knows exactly where everything is at during the cooking process.  A list of pre-programmed selections are printed right inside the door, so there's no hunting for the manual to tell the unit what you're cooking.  It has a novel keypad, in that there are actual ""real"" buttons, with a tactile feel rather than the plastic pads that most microwaves have, that often become troublesome as the unit ages.  Also, there are only three buttons for entering the coooking time, a 10 second button, a one minute button, and a 10 minute button.  If you want 20 seconds, you press the 10 second button twice, if you want 30 minutes, you press the 10 minute button 3 times, and so on.  At first this took some getting used to, but I've gotten to like it very much.  This frees up space on the keypad for other presets which are very helpful.  This brings me to my only complaint.  The labeling of the keypad is in VERY small print, and because it is black letters printed on a silver background, it makes it quite hard to read without turning on a bright light.  I am so pleased with everything else on this microwave, I've learned to work around this issue.Physically, this unit is much smaller than my previous unit, but it is still plenty big for everything I want to cook. The upside is that it takes up much less room but still cooks at a full 1200 watts, which is the maximum allowed for a household microwave oven. The interior is finished with a charcoal color, which unlike white, shows almost nothing, so it looks clean all the time.  I have to remind myself to clean the inside, because nothing shows.  It also has an interior LED lamp, which could be a little brighter, but does illuminate the interior well, and should last the life of the microwave.  I've purchased some microwave accessories (available here on Amazon), a small grill for making paninis, grilling steaks or hamburgers, and even hot dogs, and a roaster that does everything from steaming vegetables to poached eggs, baking muffins, chicken, and they work great in this microwave.  All in all I would highly recommend this microwave to anyone looking for a compact high power unit that does a great job on anything you would ever think of cooking in a microwave, and even things you normally wouldn't."
5,It looks good and works great.
4,"It fit perfect in the space I had my last microwave. It has minor scratches on it but nothing noticeable. It does have a slight noise when being used but not bothersum or too loud. I was disappointed 😞 that the instructions sent with it was not in English and I had to download the English version... That's ridiculous! If was not for that reason, Iwould of given it a 5*.  But really like it. The packaging was interesting because it was a box in a box and it was a little banged up but understandable. It was my first time getting something from the warehouse as many a times I've bought from Amazon. I'd buy from that option again."
3,"Keypad isn’t a good touch pad. Several “keys” are stiff or require multiple efforts. The unit is roomy and powerful. Keypad is a real issue, at least the one on our unit."
5,Design and build quality is sleek and pleasant on our countertop. Heats and re-heats items well thanks to it’s internal sensor. Wi-Fi/smart capabilities are great when you want to pre-plan a bag of popcorn or meal in advance. Overall this is a fantastic microwave and very happy with it.
2,Timer stopped working after one time.  The only thing I liked was the price.
3,"It's ok.  Very lightweight--the whole microwave moves when pushing push button lever to open, need to get stickers underneath legs so it will be stationary.  Also, not pleased with buzzer, it rings 5 times rather loudly EVEN if you open at first ring.  It is small, fits easily on top of refrigerator beneath cabinets above.  Note this is NOT a large interior.  The stylish stainless steel front is quite nice and sound when operating is surprisingly very quiet--except for noted buzzer ringer completing cooking time.  Overall, it's satisfactory, not really a premium quality buy."
3,"My only real complaint is that the control panel is totally un-lit.  I'm used to using a microwave in the dark with lighted buttons.  To use this in low-light areas, I need to turn on a light in the area or mount a flashlight on the unit.  Not a deal-killer now that it is installed, but I would have bought a differnt model or brand if I had been aware.  Otherwise a nice inexpensive product that heats stuff up."
4,"Unfortunately, we are returning this because it won't sit level on the countertop. In addition, we thought the keypad was lit and it's not. We started a return and thought it was missing a part of the turntable but later found it and put in in the box. However, we decided to continue return based on other issues. We liked the features but it simply didn't work well due to rocking on counter."
4,A bit noisy when closing door. As keeps beeping even after door is opened.
1,"Too loud & hard to get the turntable on right, and then doesn’t always work."
3,I love the ease of use.  The red color is vibrant.  The machine is very quiet.  The only thin is that the 6 and 7-minute buttons do not work. I am resigned to living with it since the device is too heavy to fuss with and return.  Other than that. it is very nice.
5,"Nice little microwave.  Works well, heats food quickly.  I don’t know why it’s advertised as a 700W microwave, when it actually uses 1200W continuously, the whole time it’s working."
1,"Unfortunately, I needed a super small microwave and options are limited. This microwave died after two months."
4,It does the job. My biggest complaint is that the glass plate inside comes off and slides around inside the microwave when it's turned on.
3,"perfect size for my kitchen cabinet, my only complaint is the control panel is so dark I need a flashlight to use it."
4,"I'd like to start off by saying that this is a really good microwave. It's a perfect size for my counter top,it warms beautifully and is very attractive. The one thing I do not like is the fact that the handle is plasticlooking, It should be made out of the same material the door is made out of. I'm really surprised atfarberware for doing something so tacky. They usually make very attractive products. If I was astickler like some out there I would have definitely returned it. To me its like having on a suit madeby Jones of New York with a pair of shoes from payless."
5,It was a gift.  My granddaughter bought a new house!
1,The button to open the door no longer works! So disappointing this didn’t even last 5 months in our home
2,At age 66 I’ve used dozens of microwaves in my life & this one does not work as others. Piece of garbage as far as I’m concerned. Buttons don’t work like others at all. I barely use it. Serious buyers remorse.
4,Big dent upon arrival....
5,it works and looks good
4,"So far after just a few uses, very happy with the product. Surprised that it fits in a small countertop space.Easy to handle."
5,"Nice quality microwave, quiet, sleek and sturdy.  Easy to use one touch timers.  Turntable return to front feature works as advertised."
3,Pretty good microwave. Serves its purpose and not horrible to look at it
4,"Just wanted to try something different, cell phone feature amazing, ease of use with time, really interesting product."
5,I needed a smaller microwave for my space and this one works perfectly. Does not move when i push the open button and feels significantly more solid and better built than a lot of the other smaller microwaves I looked at for this price point.
5,"This was a gift for my daughter and I was impressed with the size and how quiet the microwave was when used! The microwave is not too big or small, somewhere in the medium range. It really matched her other appliances in her kitchen which were black. Simple to use and I'm happy with the purchase!"
3,"You get what you pay for. Cheap construction. When I first plugged it in it was immediately buzzing even when off. I think that means a faulty magnetron... not sure tho.I sent it back and got a replacement, which was also buzzing, but not nearly as loud. It's more of a high pitch whine that's so unnoticeable it's acceptable.Other than that it works pretty great. My previous microwave was like 10 years old and this is a huge improvement. Nice finish looks good in the corner of the kitchen."
3,"There is a sticker on the front door with paper as thin as tissue and adhesive as strong as cement. Go ahead, try to peel it off in one piece… oh, it just shreds into a million pieces and still leaves the adhesive behind. Why would you do this Toshiba? You can tell me how to get your app in a million other non-destructive ways.Also, as of the time of this writing, there does not exist a PDF of the instruction manual. I search the web and only found manuals of different models. I searched my specific model number on Toshiba's site and it is ""not found"".  I contact customer support to request a PDF of the manual and they said they don't have it available, but to check back with them in 2-3 days. I asked if they could simply email it to me when they found it (in 2-3 days), but they were unwilling to do so and reiterated that I had to come back to them to check. That is not a customer-first approach."
5,"We have very limited counter space in our less-than-functional kitchen (not complaining too much though because I have friends who live in NYC with a sink, stove and 10 inches of what they call counter-space so...). We went without a microwave for a year once our built-in caught fire. Our landlord is, well, a landlord, so they were not going to replace it. So we got real good with slow heating things up on the stove and making the whole house at least 10 degrees higher when we heated things up in the oven. It was fine though. I actually was starting to think more highly of myself since our family was able to live without a microwave. We were two steps away from self-sufficiency and I was contemplating taking a canning class.Then the pandemic hit. Our college-aged kid was back. She couldn’t make her mac & cheese cups or ramen without a microwave. This meant she was asking me for help with how to boil water and banging pots and pans at 2AM since she’s also a vampire. Apparently. We made it two months into lockdown, with temps here getting higher and the world sort of falling apart. I wanted to be able to eat instantly, since some days I’d forget about doing that or even drinking water. So I had to get a microwave.I didn’t want to spend a lot (who has money these days?!) and wanted something that wouldn’t take up a ton of space but was functional for us. Reviews for any microwave under $100 are a mess to sift through. But I did, and finally just went with this one. I figured any microwave was better than no microwave.I don’t have any cons on this one yet. It small (but like the TARDIS, there is plenty of space inside). It’s quiet (but also my kitchen is galley-style, so it might seem loud in a wide open space, I have no idea). It fits our plates (basic ikea dinner plates, because even a few years ago who had money?) & whatever foods meant for microwaves that we have encountered thus far. Food heats evenly. Has quick buttons for common foods. I can heat up leftovers, and the kids can cook for themselves which is a whole other bonus months into us all being under one roof ALL THE TIME.I like this microwave a lot, and it does what I need it to do. I even bought a cute cover for it because we all need some nice things these days and it is ridiculous to have a microwave cover, which alone makes me smile each time I see it."
2,If you don’t mind the uneven metal cover of it..
1,"I bought this in December 2022 and was very excited to have one appliance in my small kitchen instead of a separate microwave and countertop oven.  I've used this product almost every day as I hate heating up my full-size oven to bake two portions of whatever I'm cooking.  A couple of weeks ago, while using the convection mode, the oven emitted a short buzz, like a electric power surge.  Then last Sunday (April 2023) as I was again using the convection mode, the oven started shooting FLAMES inside.  I quickly turned it off and unplugged.  Now I'm having a hassle returning it.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS DEADLY."
2,"Almost pulled the microwave off my counter numerous times trying to get the door open!  There is no button, you have to yank it open and it's so light that slides across (and off) the countertop.  Would not recommend if you have kids using this for I'd be worried it would fall on them while trying to open, yes, it's that hard.  Just my opinion.  Other than that good little microwave but I will never buy another one without a push-button door."
5,"I bought it to replace the one that I had.  It's smaller than I wanted, though. I even used a measuring tape on my broken one to make sure this one wasn't smaller then the size shown in the sellers pics. But it is smaller. Other than that, everything else is perfect."
1,This is my second one of this model. The first only lasted 3 years. The second one died exactly 1 week after the one-year warranty ended. How could they time it so closely? So another one goes to the landfill. There won't be a third one for me. Don't waste your money on this microwave.
1,I was very disappointed with this microwave. It could hardly heat the food. It does not have the power to function normally. I must return it. It is that bad.
5,Nice Microwave it's just right for a small kitchen counter tops with limited space . Warm food very fast for big or small jobs .
3,"Good size microwave for a smaller kitchen! Instructions are not so easy to understand! The turntable is a bit noisy and the covering over the keypad is peeling already!The turntable platter is very obnoxious, as it comes off the turning ring underneath! I do like the style with both stainless steel and regular black metal! It's an alright microwave,but I won't buy another one!"
1,"I have had this microwave less than 4 months and the PAINT is pealing off inside it.Also, after 3 months, the door keeps becoming ajar, and the still counts down, so I have no clue, unless i am in the room with it, how much time it has actually cooked.  Last night i had to cook the same baked potatoes 4 times..I do not think it is safe to even cook my food in it any more and I am going to have to order one from another company.  What a waste of money.I am VERY disappointed. :/"
1,Microwave sparking and catching on fire.
1,"Less than 4 months since the purchase of this microwave & it has stopped working. I expected so much more, considering my last microwave was half the price and lasted 4 years."
5,i bought this to replace the microwave in our office.  Bang for the buck it is a great unit.  Seems very well built and is holding well to reheating everyone lunches.The interior is very nice and easy to clean.
2,works as well as any microwave but the selection panel does not light up.  Update-the defrost cycle is really bad. Takes forever to defrost anything. Because of no panel light and the defrost problem I would not recommend this microwave.
2,I bought this for my mom as a gift to replace her old microwave and she is so disappointed. It's hard to open and not as user friendly as the one she owned before.
4,"This is a small microwave and so it cooks slower. For every item I used to cook in my larger one, I have to cook them longer in this one. It just took some getting used to. I like my all black small microwave that fits nicely in my small apartment."
5,"I like that it works very similar to the one I'm replacing. It's bigger than I expected. If it's as good as my last Panasonic, it will last many years."
1,Bought this as a Christmas gift & it just stopped working after only 3 months
3,Very weak power. I guess because it is small.
3,El ofrecimiento es q el microondS es de 700W y el que enviaron fue de 1200W.
2,Good microwave very nice ending ding feels solid and I love that it works with alexa.My big grip is why does it use the Msmartlife app.One you get a warning about security issues with the appTwo its nothing more then a rebranded version of the original smartlife app that has 100s of compatible devices from lights and cameras too durable good. Why rebrand to a crappie version that that only works with your microwave.The only feature  I feel is missing is if alexa could tell you when its done in case your in another room.So other then the rebranded garbage app its a good microwave.UpdateDropping  a star as the microwave does not auto update the clock its a smart device how does not not connect to ntp server to update time.
2,Small and takes forever to warm your food
5,My old lady says she didn't mind that Santa had to double back to come back just for her. She loves the color and has a new coffee pot we see is the exact same color scheme and she is ecstatic.
4,It's excellent for the price. Very happy. Fast turntable...
1,"This is the most dreadful microwave we've ever owned.  We microwave dog food twice a day. We always use the same measure of food, spread out on the plate the same way. We always use the same number of seconds, but sometimes the food is cold, sometimes it's warm and other times it's boiling hot.  This is not how a microwave should work."
5,"Absolutely love this oven it is fast,heats good and the crisper is great I didn't know what I wanted when I picked it out but sooo proud that I got this one"
3,This microwave works well but mine arrived in a crushed box and the top of it it is dented badly.
2,"I only use this to warm up food delivered to my apt.  The 700 watts is good enough for this purpose, but the push buttons are very stiff and require some effort to work.  I use a stylus or a pencil to press the buttons. They are very stiff and not easy to use.  I would have returned this unit if I had not already thrown out the box!Additional info.  Only useful to warm up soup or beverages.  Didn't realize 700 watts would be so puny! Also a lot of condensation comes out when you open door.  Push buttons are VERY HARD for me to use.  Tried to make popcorn tonight but definitely not enough power for that. Wish I had spent a little more and purchased a better unit. You definitely get what (or a little less) than you pay for."
4,This is a nice microwave for small things and for small spaces.
3,"I gave it 3 stars because I think it's a decent microwave, and low power consumption.However, it appears to be the same innards as the Farberware in the same price range, and both this microwave and the Farberware have a time-of-day clock that doesn't keep accurate time – the clock is seriously fast.  After a few days, the clock is 8 minutes fast."
3,The microwave is noisy when the glass plate rolls on the rollers; otherwise it's fine.
4,"This is a nice looking microwave with good basic settings. However, cooking times are longer than expected and results seem inconsistent. A plate of food might emerge half sizzling, half undercooked."
3,Didn’t stay even on the counter ?
1,It looks nice and is small for compact spaces. The product broke and is not usuals anymore exactly at the same time the two year warranty expired.
4,Very nice microwave appearance but a little too complicated.  Would have been excellent for the price BUT it does not let the steam out properly. That is a real problem.
1,"Reliability is a huge issue, broke after half year of light use."
4,Fits anywhere
5,"It's just a microwave, but I love it. The color is nice, it's small like my kitchen, and it workers perfectly for one. It is on the small side, but that's just what I wanted. I am very pleased with my purchase."
5,"Over the range microwave was received in a timely manner with no problems. We were replacing a similar microwave, to match other appliances in kitchen, so installation was easy and only took about 30 minutes. We have been using for two weeks and are very pleased with it."
1,bought a used one and it was missing a ring wheel even though it was listed as Like New condition
3,Microwave works fine but the Alexa app needs an update. Alexa app only works some times very disappointing
1,We have had this for less than a year and it sounds very strange. This was Amazon Choice product. I'm going to file a formal complaint.
3,It stinks inside like electrical burning wire. Stinks up your food
2,"This product fit great and worked great, for two months when it completely stopped working at all."
2,We used this for less than 6 mo and it shorted out. It sent flashes from inside like there was a can inside.. Just thankful it didn't catch on fire. I could send picture of the brown spot on the inside right but didn't think necessary to get the info out there.  Not a good feeling though when it happened.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it worked as advertised for a few months.
5,Compact microwave perfect for small spaces
4,"We got this one to replace our GE microwave that quit after a few years. This is very quiet, has better lighting to see food and it matches our refrigerator."
4,"I Remodeled our kitchen so I needed a white and silver microwave oven to match. Works pretty good but it doesn't vent well, its always full of steam when i open the door. but works good plus all the features work right."
1,"Don’t buy this thing.It was never very good at heating things evenly. Even with the spinning tray, food would warm up unevenly with spots that were ice cold and others that were too hot.The bigger problem: The keypad failed after about 1 year of rather infrequent use. So, now it’s just useless.This thing is JUNK.  Don’t buy it. Spend a little more on a better microwave."
2,"I was disappointed with the quality of the microwave. The house is very tinny. the glass plate is thin as is the roller ring. My old samsung microwave (8 years old) had a much better build. Plus, it makes the most irritating hum when it starts. Why does it have to beep FIVE times when done? Another irritation. The keypad is not lit up and as an older person (not too old), it is hard to read the selections.  the interior light is also very dim. I am not very happy with it in general but it does the job."
1,"UPDATE - 2/22/2022 - Microwave is deadThis is way to powerful, so much so it destroys ceramic plates.  I've lost a few ceramic dinner plates to it.  I have some old cheap ceramic plates from my bachelor days that we use as they seem to be able to take the heat.The super defrost feature is the absolute worst, it doesn't defrost, it just cooks the outsides of the food.  This feature is really truly terrible.My daughter loves the mirror finish though, she uses it as a mirror when the other mirrors in the house are in use.When the microwave is in operation, all 2.4ghz WIFI in my house goes out. Yes a lot of microwaves cause this, but my previous microwave I bought 15 years ago didn't.I don't recommend this product."
5,Love it!
4,Large interior with large tray to microwave on. It nukes fast and most foods are done sooner then suggested estimated times. The only complaint is the door. Make sure no one slams it. The hinge will bend EASILY and then you have to play the tap game (smacking the door gently) to realign the door so it can shut and open properly again which can prove to be a hazard since if the door is not aligned properly then more microwaves can leak out. So as long as you are careful when shutting the door the microwave is pretty much almost perfect.
5,"We acquired the 0.9 cubic foot oven and have been very pleased with it. It is much quieter than any microwave we have ever had or have even been around, as far as that goes. We now have it setting right beside the kitchen table and it doesn't hinder conversations at all.The presets make it easy to programm. Basically just one touch, then maybe another to hit ""Start"" and it is off and running. Each additional touch of ""Start"" adds 30 seconds of cooking time. Also, the turntable works great, wouldn't own a microwave without one (not sure you can buy one without these days). Heating uniformity seems to be very good, of course the turntable helps with that. Did test how easy the oven is to clean by boiling over almost an entire cup of coffee! The floor of the microwave held the spilled coffee, none of it came out the door when I opened it. Other types of spills, splatters, and explosions have cleaned up easily with just a damp rag.We have used it multiple times everyday since it arrived (about a month ago) and it hasn't missed a beat."
4,"The microwave works very well. However there are a few features that I would have like to have known about in the product description before buying.  There is no ""minute plus"" feature that allows for one touch operation and the the start/stop button is confusing to some.  Also the reset MUST be used to clear time if you remove an item before the time is up."
3,Not so easy to use as for as k ow what to do but nice and big
4,Called tech support and they told me how to change the time. Same as the users manual.  Does not work.  Their answer was to return to the seller.  I just checked online and I only had 30 days to return.  So now I am stuck with a new microwave with the wrong time listed.  I have had the microwave 45 days.
1,"Keypad didn’t work when I received it. I figured no problem things happen, but when I received the replacement it didn’t work either. I wish I could go for zero stars. Also why the heck would Amazon send me a reused product to replace a new one that didn’t work. Aren’t those sold at a discount? I’m really concerned about this."
2,After 1 year at a rental property  (lmited summer use) the Start button and #1 button are bubbling and peeling.  While it works well and I do like the pull open handle - I will have to replace as the front push button panel looks terrible.
5,"We had this exact microwave before it finally died after 15 years.  This one is a bit newer in functions but for the most part the same.  We had a special cabinet made to put this large microwave in, so we wanted to get the same size one again.  Fits perfect and we are so happy.  I really love the new feature ""Sensor Cook"" button.  You put your plate in and it uses sensors to decide how many minutes it needs to heat or thaw etc.  Food comes out perfectly heated."
4,"An air fryer is really a glorified toaster oven, the difference being a fan used to circulate the warm air.  The classification of AF vs CO comes down to fan speed, that's all folks!  The idea of circulating air for more even cooking in this small cavity is (you finish the sentence).The controls are impossible to read unless you are in good lighting, the lettering of the buttons is ghostly light gray on darker gray.  The features are not well explained and the programming is somewhat challenging.Beyond that I would recommend for two reasons: First is price, though you may pay the difference in peace of mind. Second, the all-metal interior will keep you from creating another white paint frisbee."
2,Came with a dent in the side/no dent in box—-really loud beeps but it seems to work ok
3,Not happy with this purchase. Our old one with the broken handle worked so much better. This one has uneven heating and is noisy. I really am tempted to ditch it and try another brand but of course can’t really afford to. Very disappointed and somewhat mad!
5,It’s easy to use and great size …so far I haven’t got any issue with it
3,"This product works well for basic microwaving . I have had some success in cooking a whole chicken or small turkey breast .  My biggest issue is that the LED light went out after less than two years and it is not a 'customer replacement' part .  My nearest service center is two hours away , so I am screwed ."
2,"Poorly lit side buttons, difficult to work. I don't recommend it because the clock doesn't even work. Too expensive."
1,"Worked for less than 2 years. Just stopped one day. It was noisy, hard to use. I bought because they said it air fried. After getting it,  there were no instructions in booklet to airfry. So I called customer service. They said they didn't know how that feature worked either. That it wasn't in the operating manual. Now, after less than 2 years, have to buy a new one."
5,"Bought this one after my Emerson microwave of 15 years finally when out... Love this microwave, heats food very quickly! Will be buying another one for my husband to take to his work place, so he can have a hot meal this winter."
5,This has been a great addition to our kitchen.  Color scheme is a nice match to our other appliances. Quiet compared to our last microwave. The handle style door access is preferable to the button release on many other units in my book. Seems to have plenty of power and full sized dinner plates fit without issue. Price to value seems good. Recommended!
5,"It’s lightweight , perfect size to fit on my counter under my cabinets. I love that it doesn’t take up so much space either."
3,"The microwave itself works great, and it was an overall great purchase. However, the plate inside does not have a way to stay on the spinner, it just slides off."
3,I need to be Bigger for the price
5,Fits perfectly in the space I measured.  I am totally satisfied !
3,This Microwave Air Fryer is very pretty but hard to use. The directions for microwaving are incorrect. I wind up just using the add 30 second button to microwave everything. I have not tried the Air Fryer. I would have sent it back but it's too heavy.
3,This is not 750w as they advertiseI have this mini microwave on my RV an it pull 1000+ watts
5,Ideal size for my needs and the size of my kitchen.
1,"Arrived broken, Toshiba said that it was my responsibility to have called earlier about e issue, put me on hold on three different phone calls to talk to two different supervisors neither of which had any independent thought or ability to offer anything outside repeating their policy to me over and over again. They seemed completely used to having upset customers with broken merchandise ask them for support then just blanket deny them. They told me they would replace the unit if i sent photos, which I did, then they said they would call me back FOR THREE WHOLE MONTHS AND NO ONE CALLED. THEY HAVE INVESTED MORE FUNDING IN THE MAN HOURS TO DENY ME A WORKING REPLACEMENT THAN I PAID FOR THIS MICROWAVE. IT MAKES NO SENSE AND IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE’s purpose is. I have lost all respect for toshiba’s products since they care this little about the people who keep them in business. DO NOT BUY! There are a million other cheaper microwaves from companies that know that investing in their customers in investing in their company’s long term revenue."
2,"be sure to read the lower starred reviews-- it seems to be a pattern with this microwave. I use my microwave daily and have enjoyed this machine. it's quiet, easy to use, and works well. I've had it for almost two years. tonight, heating up a cookie, it started making a loud, strange sound. I ran in the kitchen to find the microwave sparking on the inside, different red and blue colors. I opened the door and noticed the metal piece inside the microwave was burnt and there was smoke coming from inside the machine. this thing very nearly caught fire. I'm glad I was close to the kitchen and not watching tv in the other room-- this could have easily been a disaster."
2,"Not a great microwave. Power isn’t that strong, makes buzzing noises which is annoying, good for an apartment for a student etc. but bad for a home or for someone wanting a good quality microwave that lasts and is part of an actual kitchen set up."
5,I needed to replace a dead microwave and thought this might come in handy for other things as well. Love it! My favorite feature is that I can shut off the beeping - Fantastic!! The microwave functions like any normal microwave & heats everything up very quickly. It's quieter than my old microwave. I've used the oven feature and it works great too. (Really looking forward to using this during the holidays as an extra oven for cooking holiday meals.) I can see this being a great appliance for apartments or if you're moving into a place that doesn't have much space. I'll be recommending this to my son when he moves out. :) I gave 3 stars for user interface because the keypad is not backlit & it's hard to see the buttons and also because the user guide is a little confusing. [Note: I have not tried the air fryer feature yet.]
5,"Bought this sight/unseen and am very happy with it.  It's not the 1100 watt that I was used to, but it works for heating up stuff.  It's small enough and attractive enough, and well worth the price."
4,"Needed a microwave in a temporary living quarters while we remodel and live in our basement. This thing rocks! We have a two burner hotplate, an  instant pot and an electric skillet.  I don't want to move back! We have it all going on down here. The unit is surprisingly lightweight and powerful. The coded sensor cooking times mean you have to keep the guide book around but that is pretty much the only drawback."
5,"Son off to college needed something small & affordable - hopefully reliable. ✅✅-✅ so far, 2 months in!  Microwave arrived (across country from home, I know there’s Amazon on East Coast just didn’t know what to expect…),  in 2 days, perfect condition, delivered to front door!It is used daily by 6 “boys” - (all 1st timers living on their own - Lol) -  and it’s holding up great!!  Easy to use, good power, easy to clean - seems pretty tough!  My son’s contribution to the household was much appreciated - 2nd only to the cards& poker chips! BOYS.  Would definitely buy this microwave again for the next son’s flop-house! 👍🏼👍🏼"
1,"I was sent a microwave that does not work AT ALL. If you plug it in it turns on, but you cannot shut it off unless you open the door. The only way to shut it off is to unplug it. And when it is on you cannot set a timer and it doesn't even heat things up. The best part is that I'm being charged a restocking fee when I requested the refund the day the item arrived AND it doesn't work AT ALL!"
1,Item was dented and glass spiner was broken.
5,"I like that you can disable the beeps, and I love the handle.  A great buy, I highly recommend this for a small space."
2,The media could not be loaded.They might want to learn how to package electronics.
5,I haven't used a microwave in YEARS- my last one caught on fire! LOL  I usually use my Air Fryer or stove top.  I recently had a need for a microwave. bought this and have used it a handful of times and it is quiet and works well.
1,"I’ve had it for 2 months and it starting to spark when I cook something, it looks like fireworks are going off inside my microwave. Not safe to use anymore for fear that it’s going to catch fire, so not happy a waste of money"
1,Worked fine for small items and then at about the 10 month mark it just stopped working altogether.I wouldn't recommend purchasing this microwave.
1,"First is the key pad. All the buttons are about half a key stroke too low. You have to push just above the button that you need to get it to register. The next thing is a buggy system. Every once in a while, when you press a button the display will go black and it will make a long beep, as if someone is holding down the button. The next thing is it has started to do this same thing on its own. No one is touching it, and the display will go dark, and it makes the tone, but then when it stops the display will show 00:00, like it was unplugged, and plugged back in. The worst part is this product isn't even 6 months old. I've had Toshiba products in the past, but this on does not live up to the name."
1,"I really wanted to love this microwave unfortunately I can't. It had great reviews so I decided to purchase it, however it only knows one cooking temperature. ""Overcooked"".  The sensor settings did not work for me and the defrost button was a joke.  I even entered under the product weight to hope that it wouldn't start to cook the edges of meat during defrost mode and it still didn't work. Terrible microwave don't waste your time or money."
1,"Amazon wouldn't allow me to post my original version of this review, so I am aiming for a more temperate condemnation of this microwave this time around. This microwave is a piece of garbage and the company that manufactored it was wildly unhelpful. I bought this on 07 Feb 2018. It stopped working EXACTLY 2 months later on 07 April 2018. Customer service refused to repair or replace the item, saying that it was out of warranty. DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE. I had a $40 sunbeam microwave that worked for 11 years until it finally gave up the ghost. I ordered this one because I liked the retro style and the red matched my kitchen. Clearly, appearance is not what one should be shooting for in small appliances. This is junk."
5,I recommend this product for anyone who needs a microwave. It’s proven reliable and simple to use.
3,So far the microwave works but the clock is impossible to set.  I followed the instructions but the clock/timer button is not functioning.  Very irritating to always have the wrong time displayed.
1,"Bought this first of May and now does not work.  Unplugged and does not reset.  SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TRASH"
4,"Bought this as a Black Friday deal. Box didn’t look to have much damage but it was probably dropped hard at some point. Tried to use it and didn’t heat the bowl of pasta for my kids school lunch. Tried for 8 minutes. Outside sides were hot to touch and interior was hot but food remained cold. Amazon is sending me a replacement so we’ll see how it worksUpdate- replacement one sent does work! Exterior doesn’t get hot like the 1st one I bought. Hope this one lasts like the 27 year one I replaced (that was still working but figured I’d take advantage of the Black Friday deal).  Deducted one star for the inconvenience of having to package up the 1st one, return it and wait for this new one"
4,it look good
1,"I bought this due to it not using so much electricity, but it takes to long to heat-up items and most of all, it develops a strong mildew smell inside that I have to been able to eliminate by cleaning."
4,"Use for small cooking, I don't like the inside color BlACK, and very week light, difficult to clean."
4,"The microwave worked well and functioned properly. It had plenty of power and was large enough to accommodate almost any portion. The only negative I have experienced with this oven is the fact that the keyboard is not illuminated. Overall, this microwave is a good value for the money."
4,Wish I had order 1100 watt instead of 900. Did realize there was such a difference between the 2 . Sorry I didn't send this one back before expiration.
3,"I find this microwave/convection appliance to be very complicated to operate...too many actions required for even the most simple of cooking....I have another microwave....very easy....Never had a convection oven, but this one takes about as long as regular oven, and takes up counter space.....just sayin'...."
4,Microwave multi functions as an air fryer and more. Love it
2,"I have chosen GE products for years and never had a complaint - until now.  This unit was bought for size.  I had very little counter space and needed a downsize microwave.  It looks good but doesn't live up to the usual GE standard:  noisy, cheaply made, confusing controls with no instructions, the door opens...occasionally.  NOT a happy choice and left a very bad taste for GE products."
1,"Ordered for elderly person as a gift ...has no instructions included and is unevenly heating food.  When the microwave is cooking the  food, the outside of the oven gets extremely hot"
1,My small plate won't even fit in order for it to turn.  Plus it doesn't heat right.  Don't buy it.  Now their holding up my refund and was lied to 5x by Amazon reps.
4,"Small,In the house"
5,Happy with the size and ease of operation.
4,"Neither a great microwave nor a great oven, but has fair utility in both departments for the price point. Can't use the element without convection, so everything baked dries out quickly unless it's well covered. Doesn't work well as a broiler in any circumstance. The element makes it more difficult to clean than a traditional microwave. The display is not backlit, so is utterly impossible to read in low light. The exterior of the box gets so hot I can't store anything near it. Using the combo cooking programs requires more thoughtfulness than I'm willing to spend, and I was disappointed that I couldn't get the box in white. If I had more space I'd go back to a separate microwave and purpose-built toaster oven, but overall this offers a reasonable compromise."
4,Keep in mind this is a low wattage microwave (it takes forever to hear something) but that’s the trade off for the compact size.  If you want a more powerful microwave- get a bigger one .  Love the fact that you can turn off the sound.  Good value for the money.  One minor issue (the buttons are not particularly responsive - you kind of have to put some pressure on them)
4,Easy to set up and easy to use.
5,Its a microwave and yes it reheats my coffee!
1,A chunk fell off!!! How many microwaves has my family been exposed to?
1,"Love this microwave.  Huge interior (19"" turntable) gives plenty of room for almost any dish.  Love the sensor feature.  Monitors itself and stops when food is done.  As with other reviews, I am being careful with the door.  I don't slam this one the way I did with the old one...but with care I think it will hold up.  Would love to have a second one, but need the counter space. It is big.  but that is why I bought it.Revision:  Delivered Jan 3. Return window closed 1st week of Feb. Today April 3 screen began flashing on and off with all 8's. Heard a sizzling sound from inside and microwave DIED. <4  months of light use and it is dead. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  IT DOES NOT LAST LONG. Attempts to contact Amazon and Panasonic product support proved useless.  Amazon will only honor 30 day return. and Panasonic screens took me in circles with no help. again-DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. If it dies (& it probably will) you are stuck with it."
1,The start button quit after 2 months.....call to RCA which is Curtis Int....pay to ship it back plus insurance...I think not...just went and got another....Lesson learned about ordering 3rd party. Never had this issuewith Amazon
3,"It is a good microwave, just what I needed"
2,Normally I love Faberware products. This came with a scratched pad surface. It looked like it had been used but was in a box that had never been opened. The interior was perfect and a dark grey which tends to hide food that has been splattered (a real plus)The features are wonderful...easy and convenient.
1,"I’ve had a Panasonic microwave and loved it. I purchased a new one when my old one stopped working after 12 years. The new unit has the same buttons, square footage and wattage as my last one. I’m sure once another new one arrives it will be perfect. Thank you Panasonic!I feel like all of this was Amazon because the microwave came from their warehouse and not Panasonic’s.The box made a clunking sound before I opened it so I could tell something was wrong. Turns out the glass turn table was floating around inside the microwave instead of sitting in the precut styrofoam. Along with the poor packing job, the front of the unit was dirty as though liquid food stuff had splashed on it. Unfortunately for Amazon, the door did not close completely and there was a dint in the top right corner of the unit, so I returned it.I guess the main reason I’m writing this review is to make people aware of some of the crazy things that must happen at the Amazon warehouse. What made Amazon think it would be a good idea to receive returned items and without any inspection just mail that item to the next customer? No one opened the box, cleaned the broken unit, repacked it correctly into it’s styrofoam “security blanket”. Crazy right? At any rate, I returned it the same day I received it and Amazon refunded my money. The only set back is, I’m still without a microwave while waiting for the next one to arrive."
3,"Microwave arrived on time;  packaging intact with no discernible exterior damage noted when unpacked.  So far;  meets expectations.  However, noted a 2 inch wide dent/dimple on the inside of the microwave back wall.  Because it is not on the exterior,  speculate use of defective part  in the assembly and inadequate inspection process.  Hopefully,  the inside ""dent"" will not affect operation.  Also, the outside metal frame is not flush on the right top side;  resulting in a small gap.  (Again, poor assembly/inspection).  Oh,  as other buyers have pointed out; the LED light is not blue as advertised.  It is green."
4,"Not Big, Not too small, Perfect Size! Unfortunately the metal lining close to the touch pad was bent! Other than that flaw the microwave itself is pretty decent!"
4,"This is the second unit we have purchased.  The previous unit had the dial/knob and buttons that sticked out a bit.  This has a smooth touchpad.  The previous unit was purchased in December 2012.  It started to shut off while running after about 3.5 yrs.  We like the functions of this unit and it also fit into a small opening in the cabinets -- plus we understood how it works!There are two minor things that are somewhat annoying at the moment:  1) The plate rattles when certain items are on it, 2) the door doesn't swing open on it's own (when you push the button in to open the door, it opens about 2/3 the way and then is stopped).  There seems to be a design in the hinge that stops the door - perhaps to prevent it from swinging wide open (which I had liked on the previous model!).I doubt that either warrant sending it back but I'm not sure if they are flaws given that we didn't experience it on the older model.  Other than that, it's a great microwave and priced well.  Reviews of microwaves lasting 10+ yrs and comparing to this aren't relevant.  The technology changes so much that it's worthwhile to upgrade -- or replace when it's no longer working!"
5,"Y lo devolví porque ya no lo nesecitava ,pero no me parece que haya tenido que pagar por una caja$10.27 para devolverlo cuando ni lo abrí"
3,I like the style.  I'm not crazy about its capacity.  Takes longer than expected to heat food.
2,Does weird stuff to our food. If I heat up cooked carrots or green beans you can see sparks between the vegetables. The sparks create burn marks and stink. The reason I gave it two stars is because it hasn't caught fire yet. Over a year old. Going to buy a different microwave.
4,"Buttons are too close together.  And hard to read, I thought the numbers and buttons would be a little bit bigger.  Work really well."
5,This replaced the one that was bought several years ago and so far seems to be what we needed. L:arge opening and deep for just about any size dish you could put into it.
5,"This is the quietest microwave I've ever owned, and it has performed well so far. It makes a perfect bag of popcorn, steams veggies, warms up soups and will be fine for my limited uses. I can't speak yet for its longevity, but a review I read elsewhere said that the key to countertop microwave longevity is moisture control. Countertop microwave interiors have a baked enamel finish that is not as resistant to moisture effects (cracked lining, metal exposure, rust) as under-range microwaves. If steam collects after cooking, leave the door open until it evaporates and/or wipe the interior dry. One slight disadvantage: Cooking times less than 10 minutes require entry of 4 digits; for example, a cooking time of 5 minutes will require entry of a leading zero after the Time button is pushed (0-5-0-0). This is easy to get used to but different from many other brands."
2,The button to raise and lower the power setting does nothing at all. Not good.
1,"I was looking for a microwave for my new apartment and the first one i ordered came with a huge dent in the back. I was willing to give it another chance considering i liked the look of the microwave and desperately needed one so i got a replacement. this is where it went downhill….. the replacement then came with a dent at the top. let’s keep in mind the boxes were not dented or damaged which shows me that this isn’t a carrier issue. Due to the amount of back and forth i’ve had to do just to get a decent microwave, it simply just isn’t worth the headache.  If your going to spend more than $100 on a microwave, i’d suggest spending it elsewhere to avoiding having to deal with defective/damaged items"
1,"This purchase was a complete waste. I was super excited to order this microwave because I love my ninja air fryer, and thought wow this sounds great! Well I was wrong this airfryer microwave heats up so hot it's super dangerous. The front get hot as a stove top, and would definitely burn you. Then the back heats up so incredibly hot that your wall will either catch on fire or get damaged. I did return this product after one time use. I will mention this item came damaged in the right corner when I started it I could see the light shining through. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product."
5,With poor vision I found this to be easier to see the settings  and simple to use. Decided to get a food  cover ( came wita tray ). Wanted to make sure it fit so went to item web page and saw a mistake. The real width is not 15 but 13. The company switched the diagonal and the width figures. So beaware it is smaller ID than advertised. It's still plenty roomey and a good unit.
5,"Good size.  Easy to operate.  Don't meet a masters in electrical engineering to heat up your food.  Our old one finely gave up the ghost 👻 so it was time for a new one.  Nice footprint.  Not too big or small.. bet the 3 bears wish they had this one.  Then their food would not be too cold, too hot and always just right.  Nice unit.  Quick shipping.  Well packaged.  Does show what's on box.  Amazon did not rebox."
5,"I mainly bought this because I needed a certain replacement size BUT now I'm really happy with the new features. The reheat that watches for steam to stop is awesome for left overs. No more trial and error or sitting there watching the food and guessing if it's hot yet. Powerful, quiet and easy to use."
4,Great small microwave for the price!  Not the most powerful.  That is the only drawback.
5,Easy to use. Nice digital features.
1,"We really wanted to like this microwave with Alexa integration. It worked most of the time via Alexa. If a child was in the home and started it via Alexa with nothing in the oven it could be a hazard. Microwave will not update daylight savings time when connected to Alexa. We have spent the last month on the phone with their warranty department to no avail. They promise to return call, they do not. They put you on hold and hang up on you. They say they escalate the problem to a higher level and we will receive a call with in a week and for 2 1/2 weeks no calls. Today I called twice and now to start warranty process they want pictures of the microwave and it's serial # and a copy of the purchase receipt, even though I registered the oven with them the day I purchased it. Their customer service is the worst. The cabinet of the oven is cheap thin metal, you could not put anything on top of the oven as it deflects under any weight. Very disappointed in this purchase and will be requesting a refund or calling the Better Business Bureau. Buyer beware."
5,Me agrado la rapidez en la entrega y el buen precio del producto
5,I am not one for measuring it’s a larger unit but works really good !
5,"My home didn't come in with a built in microwave and I don't want to purchase a large one.  This one does the trick reheating leftovers or popping popcorn.  Although, it may take a little longer to reheat, it does the job.  Plus, I like the price and the next day delivery.  The gray interior is a nice touch too."
2,It was just fine - until it wasn't. Died after only a year and a half.
1,"I bought this and immediately had to order a replacement. And even when getting a replacement, I had the same issues as the first. The microwave would break my plates. It didn't  seem like a microwave because it would cook the food instead of reheating the food. If you like to cook with your microwave, if that's even possible, then this is for you. But even then, I wouldn't recommend buying."
2,This product had to be returned after 4 months completely stopped heating
2,"Did I like the then price of $57.42 when I ordered this in March 2020? You betcha! It worked fairly well, until it didn't, less than 2 years after buying it. :("
2,"I have a Toshiba laptop from 2012 that has been running for over ten years, no problems, great audio (HarmonKardon) etc., so I thought a Toshiba microwave would be great too. And it did run, from October 2020 to June 2023, then it unexpectedly operated with a weird buzzing noise, and no longer would heat. I'm guessing a Capacitor relating to the ""Cyclotron"" went out. Loved the fact that it had a handle, had well-laid out controls. 90% of the time I would run iot for only 2 or 3 minutes at a time (to heat coffee or water or to mnelt the cheese on some hot dogs and buns etc.) My old Cuisinart microwave was well over 10 years old when it began to spark because the interior was rusting out, but at least it was still working. This Toshiba model just decided to quit, no rust or other apparent problems. Not too bad for about $100, but still only 2.8 years of use lol"
3,"It is kind of complicated to use as it does so much.  I would have preferred something simpler to use.  There are so many features that you have to read all the instructions to find out what they all do.  If you are looking for a simple easy microwave, this is not the one, despite its being rated 5 stars."
1,"I purchased this microwave to replace my old Panasonic after years of service. The first thing I noticed was that the door was a little tight. I had to press the open button a few times to get it open. The door has too much bare metal. It doesn't have smooth edges like my old microwave.After installing the glass rotation plate, I put a microwave safe cup containing water in icrowaveto test the unit. I typed in 20 seconds and pressed start. The microwave seemed like it wanted to start, but the screen read H98. A web search identified the error code as a problem with the magnetron. It was either damaged or burned out. Where's the quality control?Even without the problems, the unit had a cheaper look to it compared to my old Panasonic. Especially for $300. I sent the heavy piece of junk back and will do some research before purchasing another microwave."
1,Bought this on 5/1/21 and it randomly stopped working 5 months later. Not worth the money!
4,"Cons: Impossible to see in any pictures but there is a heating element in the top of the cooking cavity.  This is a feature I was really trying to avoid.  Space arrangement was more square than rectangular so unable to use a number of the containers I expected to utilize.That said, I love the stainless steel interior.  This is one feature I really wanted.  The power level on the microwave function is high enough to cook frozen dinners using the timing for a 1,000 w microwave.  Convection has worked well and it browns like a dream.  Better keep the directions handy at first.  The convection feature is not as intuitive as the Sharp I had previously.  The convenience of being able to bake (even if it IS a small amount) without using the large oven and heating up the entire kitchen is wonderful.  Great little micro convection for the size and price.Have answered a number of questions concerning this oven and been using it for awhile now.Overall: I love it,  Living in Florida I would NOT use a full size oven during the 6 month summer swelter.  As a retiree cooking for two and baking occasionally it is ideal.  We still have a roast, baked potato or casserole when we want one.  No problem of any kind, and Yes the light is on while using the convection settingMay 2, 2021 : UpdateHave now had this for just over 2 1/2 years.  About 6 weeks ago the light started to flicker and flash.  Since I know this is not user accessible and would be expensive to replace I lived with it until it died after 5 weeks.  An hour ago I was baking a frozen casserole on convection (in a cardboard container).  Suddenly I started to hear very loud popping noises!  Rushed to stop the oven and when I opened it the turntable was in a number of large pieces.  Between parts and labor I suspect repair would cost me half the price I paid for the unit originally.I have been using micro convections for 40 years and love them.  My first two lasted 18 and 16 years respectively.  Though on the small side, this was a great unit until recently.  I now hesitate to replace it with another Toshiba.  Price would show it cost about $100 a year.  I do not buy throw away appliances!March 1, 2023After replacing the turntable over a year ago I became nervous because the light started randomly coming on and flickering.  About the same time, I confirmed that the convection temperature no longer was even near accurate.  After much research and soul searchingI have replaced this with its (almost) twin.  Can't beat the functionality and convenience for the price.  Also, as mentioned initially, in the south it allows baking without heating up half the house.  Since our power bills have recently gone up 20% and scheduled to increase furthe, the power savings over an electric oven will be considerable."
2,It’s super small. And it smell like it’s burning every time you use it
5,"The build quality of the microwave is really good. It's solid and well designed all-around, easy to setup, the feet on it are balanced, and it has a lot of good functions. The manual included is very thorough and helpful and doesn't just cover the necessities. The cooking efficiency is great and it manages to cook items completely. There is engineering involved in how well the heat covers the total area and object area and the cheap models tend to lack in that regard.The multi-phase programming and saving personalized settings will be the key differences here over the competition. How much you intend to utilize those or want to have the option may factor into your decision. There's also a lack of smart features which can be seen as a negative or a bonus depending. Personally I prefer to forgo them.But it's a great microwave and I've had no issues with it at all, even when programming the clock which has historically always been a pain to do."
3,"It's not worth the hassle, spend less and you'll still probably get a more satisfying experience with about any other IoT microwave out there. Panasonic cooks more evenly at a lower wattage. I wish I'd stuck with them.If you do buy one, FRIENDLY WARNING: Put an anti-slip mat under the thing, otherwise when you pull on the door handle to open the microwave the whole machine slides toward you - good luck if the contents in the microwave happened to be liquid"
1,"I gave this 5 stars approximately one month ago. Changing to 1 star because it made loud sounds and then flashed fire inside which was contained because it was inside. There was smoke coming from the vent inside the microwave as well. It didn’t seem to have much smell. Fortunately I was right there. I contacted support and was provided a link to email that doesn’t work. Therefore I cannot contact the company and I need a microwave so will order a different one now. I will change my review if I am assured this issue is fixed and I am compensated for the microwave. Currently, I am stuck. I loved the look and ease of use of it per my prior review. I hope no one else has this issue."
5,Its a perfect microwave for heating up drinks and food.  I never used a microwave for cooking. I just don't cook in them.  If you are a person that uses a microwave to cook then this would probably be too small and too lower in power outage.  I believe this is 700 Watt power so just enough for what I said earlier for heating up drinks and food.  I love mine.
5,"For the size of this microwave, it is pretty powerful. Was pleasantly surprised to find it heated water as fast as it did when it is only 700 watts. It heated the water as fast as my 1100 watt microwave in my kitchen. This was purchased for travel and to use if power is interrupted since it can be run with the solar power station I have."
1,"This microwave is the most difficult to operate, often times it won't even start, light might come on inside but turntable doesn't go around, and fan doesn't start.  I believe it's defective but figuring it out too late.I have used microwaves since they first came out, and this is the most illogical to use.  Maybe somehow wrong buttons pushed, but only way to reset, is to unplug and plug back in. Stop/Cancel doesn't seem to reset.Wish I could return it, but have missed the 30 day window Amazon has on this one.  We purchased it for a senior relative that lives 4 hours away, so we were only there a couple times during the 30 days, to help him use it, and it is useless to him. I cannot figure it out, nor other relatives who have tried to help. It's just squirrely to use and we're not figuring it out.  The manual doesn't address our issues.Guess we just have to eat the cost and buy a reliable ""name brand""."
4,"Had to return the first one.  The inside light faintly glowed, but wasn’t lighting the interior at all.  This oven has a gray interior, so absence of a light is an issue.  Couldn’t see if water was boiling yet, etc.  Called the Farberware company and they said these were not made to be able to pull the cover off and replace a light bulb!  (looks like it’s an LED)  The oven also seemed a bit loud and at various intervals the noise would seem to increase.The return process worked great.  Initiated the return transaction Wed night, shipped the oven back Thurs, received a new one Friday morning!  Much easier than I anticipated.New oven is much quieter, and the light works.  The mesh grid inside the door’s window does blur your vision to what’s heating inside.  Seems weird, but I can live with it.What I like about this oven:  1000 watts is still pretty decent, heats liquids quickly.  Interior size is not huge, but it’s sufficient for our purposes.  I can get a dinner plate or small platter in there, plenty of room for the splatter-guard cover to go over it.  And the overall size is not too big.  I was able to reclaim some of our counter space with this oven over our larger old one.  Happy with it so far."
5,"I bought this microwave purely because it fit inside the weird nook in my kitchen wall. Unlike others, mine is and has always been very quiet. It is the most quiet unit I have ever owned or used. Initially I didn't trust it, but here we are my 5th year of use.It looks good (only the stainless bits are visible in the nook), it is easy to use with great controls, makes crispy pizza rolls, boils liquids and blows up marshmallows so I give it high marks overall."
3,"The product works as it should. It's compact, as indicated and looks nice on the counter. The only problem is that's it's the loudest microwave I've ever heard. My previous unit was much bigger but it was quiet. Not sure I would choose it again"
5,Love how quiet this microwave is. With the air fryer option I now can have a roast without having to use my oven and heat up the kitchen.
4,Easy to use. Good upgrade to similar model. I hope it lasts more then 3 years like the last one.
1,Very nosey.I personally don't think it was from the factory by the packaging.I purchased the black front and it's hard to view the keys.Sent it back to Amazon the same day it was received.
2,Received banged up box the foam inside broken up. Plugged it up looked out then used it the sound is extremely loud hear it two rooms over. The next day my daughter used it made noodles and she reported the lights are flickering inside while she removed her noodles. So today I go to use use press quick start 5 and it went blank. Returned of course I don't have time for troubleshooting nothing I rather return and try another one. Two Stars for the look of it The rest was to sensitive to withstand the handling at the warehouse and shipping.
3,Had to return it  because it was too small. Wanted a larger one but I was not refunded the entire so decided not to order.
1,"This was a terrible, terrible, purchase.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  Less than a year old, but of course beyond the short-term warranty, I was heating up some leftovers on a simple two-minute, push-the-2-button, cycle.  Partway through, I heard silence, thinking ""Has it been two minutes already?""  Ordinarily, it beeps 5 times at the end of the cycle, and there had been no beeps, just silence.  I looked at it, and the screen was blank and dark.  Opened the door, the light did not go on; dark, though bulb was close to new.  No re-set button that I could find.  The microwave had not been moved, bumped, disconnected, etc., to cause such an event or effect its performance like this, in any way.  The unit is nothing more than a ""boat anchor"" at this point, and I still have to dispose of it; it weighs a ton.  I will never buy another Toshiba product, again, the risk is just too great based on this adverse experience. I'd give this product a ""0"" Review, if that was even possible."
4,"Easy to use, love the size, louder than I figured it would be compared to others"
4,"Works fine. A very simple, inexpensive unit. If you're looking for something to just reheat food, make popcorn or cook vegetables this is for you. It is very small, though. A standard dinner plate will fit but will not be able to rotate on the carousel. Good for dorm rooms or small apartments."
1,Barely a year and the bottom breaks open...you certainly can't use it now with radiation issues. My husband hated this anyways ...so if you just like to eat popcorn and use it once in a while thats fine....not regular use.
4,"This microwave cooks better than any other I have ever used.  That being said, the controls are a bit difficult to use.  Defrost doesn't work well.  Reheat is great if you use it right.  Overall. it's worth the high price."
5,"I barely use the 100% air fry or broiler modes, so I can't review those. And frankly, the extra things to wash, while I have a full size oven & a toaster? Nah. Not enough reason to bother for me. But I love the microwave+convection combination, and reading the manual (which i downloaded and printed out larger than most manuals are printed so that's a bonus in my book) to figure out how the alternate modes worked gave me great info on what power levels to use for what. Soup turns out great now, I can melt butter to a really good liquid consistency without it separating, and I can reheat chicken wings & fries at the same time without overshooting on the fries with the microwave+convection combi mode (combi-1). Our household is probably under-utilizing this for the price, but it has prevented my two roommates from buying an air fryer or toaster oven then forgetting about them after 2 uses like what happened with the waffle maker, the blender, the popcorn maker, etc. & that's worth so much in my book."
1,"THE STAINLESS STEEL MICROWAVE JUST WAS NOT BIG ENOUGH,,,0.7 CF,,,  EVEN FOR A BAG OF POPCORN,,, OR A LARGE PLATE,,, AND IT DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER 700W JUST ISN'T ENOUGH FOR ME,,, IT TOOK FOREVER TO HEAT EVEN SMALL FROZEN FOODS,,,  THOUGH IT'S LOOKS WERE APPEALING,,, I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO SEND IT BACK,,, I JUST BOUGHT A NEW ONE,,, A 1.3 CF 1100 WATT MICROWAVE FROM SOMWHERE ELSE,,,"
4,"Rating closer to 3.5 stars.-  It takes 15 seconds longer to boil 1 cup of water, compared to my other microwave of equivalent power.-  Seems to take longer to make a pizza compared to standard convection oven - and not as crisp.- Convection temperature settings are in 25 F increments - so can't get to 360 as recommended by a recipe.-  Popcorn usually pops completely (timer based, not sensor) - had one occasion where it was only half popped.-  Finally - noisy,If I can adjust temperature to get crisp chicken and pizza (it says it has air-fry, so should be possible), I'll keep it.  I can work around the other issues, adjust myself rather than count on the unit."
5,"Turntable doesn't fit properly on spindle and makes bumping, groaning and grinding noises. Returning. Air Fry and convection work, as does the microwave except the turntable.  I thought Toshiba would have better quality control.Update- called Toshiba and got to talk to a human who said it was defective and to exchange it.  So I did, even though it meant repackaging it and taking it to UPS myself (rather than returning it unpackaged to Kohls which would have been much easier).  Anyway, the replacement has worked just fine for over a month now, so I'm very pleased. I especially like being able to turn off the buzzer."
3,"This would have been a 5 star review, but the panel on the right, that’s meant to protect the internals is bizarre. It looks and feels like cardboard, so, naturally, I took it out thinking it was part of the packing. I ripped it (cause it’s basically cardboard) while taking it out. Now, I can’t find a replacement and my microwave is at risk. It still works fine, but from everything I’ve read, this will significantly decrease the lifespan of the microwave. Such an important piece should be made of different material. Maybe screwed down. Or at least have a warning. This is such a bad design choice it feels almost intentional."
4,"This does great on the small jobs which is want we wanted. Exception is that it is too small for microwave popcorn and the popcorn tends to scorch. You can stop it before the scorching, but then a quarter of the bag is still unpopped. (underpowered?) Never had this problem with our previous (slightly larger) microwave."
2,"We got this after having an LG that was a bit larger. We were looking forward to getting a smaller microwave to leave us more counter space. Also the LG buttons were REALLY hard to read in low light, but other than that, no complaints. The grass is always greener.We looked at several smaller models and picked this one after reading reviews and ratings. I won't buy it again.It might work in a dorm for heating hot pockets or something like that, but not as a household piece for regular use.Our issues with it:• It doesn't heat consistently. Sometimes it'll make things super got. Sometimes the same size thing on the same setting will have cold spots. It's just inconsistent...which is annoying AF when you heat the same thing repeatedly. The old microwave I automatically set the same way each time. This one's a crap shoot.• You can't heat and have a timer going at the same time. Sounds stupid, but the LG was great on this score. We could use the kitchen timer for one thing and heat something else at the same time, no problem. With this, it's one or the other.• Buttons - still not easier to read (though easier than the LG. My visions decent - but it's like the people who make microwaves have never looked at ADA regulations. I'd certainly never get this for anyone without good vision.• The little plastic thing under the glass plate is too small a diameter. This should normally be as close to the size of the base of the plate as possible. This one is really small, so you need to make sure you center whatever you put in it or it can get knocked out of whack easily.I'm going back to LG next time - even if I have to rewrite the damn numbers with a paint pen.ADDENDUM - It's now just under two years later. The button that opens and closes the door is starting to crap out already. I don't know what I was expecting for under $90, but I sure as hell won't buy this thing again."
4,"This is one of the few models small enough to fit into our space.  The pull handle to open is nice.  The power is what you would expect.  But you can not see the food cooking through the window.  When you open the door, the light goes on.  But if the light is on during cooking, you can't tell because you can't see through the window.  I've tried with the room lights on and off.  Unfortunately, small, inexpensive models tend to fail as soon as the warranty expires.  We keep buying different brands.  I have hopes this one will last longer.  It arrived packed well and was easy to set up.  The turntable doesn't anchor well so you have to re-position it from time to time.  All in all, It's fine."
5,My favorite part of this quality microwave is the ability to turn off the beep sound.  Very quiet. Wonderful microwave.
1,Not a very powerful product but ok for small spaces so you make it work. A bit overpriced.Updated 3/10/2021 save your money do not buy this. You have to give it 20 minutes to get your food reheated properly ... omg I am gonna give it away. U give 6 minutes and sit down to eat some parts are hot some parts are cold. So you have to go back and reheat again by the time your done you lose your appetite. I wish I could give it zero stars. Save your money
2,"Not worth the value. You get what you pay for…it’s super cheap, doesn’t heat things properly. It’s a waste of money. I’m sure they have better ones, so I would just recommend higher voltage."
4,"It works like a microwave should. It doesn't have any outstanding features that would give it five stars.It is larger than I realized, but that didn't affect my review because I should have noted the size before ordering it. Make sure you check the dimensions - I found this when searching amazon for ""small microwaves,"" and this is definitely not a small item!"
5,"I needed a small microwave to fit in my island cabinet, i have two kids and it’s gotten more use than I thought it would, works like a champ and doesn’t take up a bunch of room. You really don’t need a larger microwave than this unless you’re cooking dinner in it each day."
4,"For $80, this is an excellent value.  I really do not understand several comments made by other reviewers, such as that the beep is too loud.  Reallly?  Same as every other microwave I have owned.  And one person said the unit moves when you pull on the handle.  Really?  Are you yanking it?  Are you setting the rubber feet in a pool of oil?  No, it does not move in normal use.This unit has all of the basic functions, including a rotating glass plate to make cooking even.  However, I do have a few minor complaints, which earned it 4 stars.1. The “memory” function is a very nice feature.  Unfortunately, it is not non-volatile memory, so if the power fails, your programming is gone.  This would cost pennies to fix, with the right microprocessor.2. Inconsistent entry:  when you enter a time to cook, it is as you would expect:  enter 12 for 12 seconds, 345 for 3 minutes, 45 seconds, etc.  But when you enter time, you must enter leading zeros.  Or when entering time for cooking in memory mode.  To get 45 seconds, enter 0045, for example.  This is poor microprocessor programming.But for $80, the fact that you have a working, fully functional microwave that has express times (press START for 30 seconds, press 1 for 1 minute, etc), and other functions such as defrost, it is a winner.  Just watch out for the two data entry modes it uses.I use memory 1 for 45 second cook - this is my time for heating up coffee (my big microwave, more powerful, works with 30 seconds, but it is 1200 watts, this is 900).  I also have memory 2 programmed for 10 seconds.  I use this to warm up a stick of butter, or heat up cold cat food.  Have not used memory 3 yet.  Even my big unit did not have the memory feature!  If only it was non-volatile.It is easy to tell when you need to reprogram the memories - when the clock needs to be reprogrammed, so do the memories.We bought it for temporary use in a mobile home while we were waiting for our real home...  Did not know we were addicted so much to microwaves - until I was getting lukewarm coffee after adding the creamer... :)"
5,Good quality microwave works well not noisy it's a little small inside considering the overall size of the microwave which is the same size as the previous one we had but the previous one was larger inside but the other one accumulated moisture inside this new one no problem with moisture inside no smells no accumulation of moisture so I will take the smaller interior any day over moisture and smell problems which we had with the other microwave this is a great microwave
5,Great for small area.
5,I was skeptical about buying such an affordably priced appliance but boy was I wrong. This little powerhouse is excellent heating things up quickly and I love the manual door pull. My old microwave press-Button door always got stuck. Despite my serious misgivings I am sincerely happy with this microwave. It’s definitely a keeper and does its job and then some. The compact size is ideal so you don’t have a giant clooge in your kitchen area but a compact smart looking microwave. I highly recommend it.
3,"I love the microwave but hate that at 5 weeks & used by only two people, the start button is bubbled up & it makes the microwave look old - I would not but this one again because of that"
3,Just a year old
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE.Bought this for my senior citizen mother on her fixed income.  Ordered June 3, received June 6 and delivered to my mother around June 10 (Amazon deliveries can never locate her condo so I order them to me and deliver).  Mom calls me tonight, August 12th, to tell me it's not working.  She's checked the circuit breaker, changed outlets, we went over everything and nothing.  The microwave is dead.  No return feature on Amazon now that it's over 30 days and I can't access any other means of Amazon support to find other options via warranty or whatever.  Will never buy another appliance via Amazon and will never buy another Farberware product.Anyway, if you're considering purchasing this microwave, don't do it.  I warned you.  Sorry if I sound off balance, but  I have too many things to worry about besides a crappy microwave that barely lasteed two months.This was not purchased as part of promotion.  Full price was paid/wasted."
2,"The bad :#1 : The buttons aren't where the markings are. 1/4 to 1/3 of an inch offset, in various directions.#2 : you can't boil water in this microwave. the water vapor sensor will cut the power off every time. no way to get around it.#3 : the BEEP! is very short and soft. no volume adjustment."
3,Good
4,"sometimes the ""done"" beep goes off continuously while it is still running. but over all its okay for a cheap little microwave"
4,"I haven't had this long, but so far it's probably the best microwave I've ever had. It's nice to look at, cooks perfectly, and has a variety of useful settings. I really love the interior lighting, which is a blue/white light similar to natural or daylight light bulbs; it's very easy to see inside without having to squint or press against the door.These are the things that need improvement:• switching between Imperial (oz) and metric (kg) can only be done after plugging it in• switching to silent mode (no beeping) can only be done after plugging it in• the door latch is stiff, requiring a lot of force to engage, and incredibly loud; closing the door is like slamming itThe problem with the latch is the most concerning, given Panasonic's documented history of problems with latch failure. It can be circumvented by holding down the open button while you close the door, then releasing it once the door is closed, but this really shouldn't be necessary.Overall a great product, but Panasonic really needs to develop a better latch technology."
4,Bought this to replace another GE microwave I had for decades that finally stopped working. I stuck with GE because it seems to be the only brand that beeps every minute if you don't open the door once it is done heating. I have a tendency to heat things up and then forget about them so that feature is a necessity. This one beeps as expected. Not too loud which is also a bonus because I work nights and don't want to disturb the neighbors when I heat something up when I get home. It seems small but it fits perfectly on the small counter I have. So far I've had no issues heating anything or problems with the size.
4,The microwave is bright red and clean but has a big dent in the top.The package looks good so I'm not sure when it got dented.I just had a heart procedure so I can't lift so I paid someone 20.00 to set it up for me because I knew it would be 2wks before I could lift.I'm really disappointed because in order to return it...I have to pay again to have it repackaged and someone to help me load it for a return.When you stand in front of the microwave the whole right top is pretty much dented.
4,"I keep a small spot light to shine on the screen to see where the precise numbers are. The letters and numbers are very hard to see. GE should consider sending all buyers a fine sticker  for the screen spot with legible numbers and letters, so we can stick it there. ."
4,"This farberware microwave looks great and works great. I like all the preset buttons and the handle makes it easier for me to open. The TouchPad could be a bit larger for older folks but it's still readable. The only complaint is that it's quite loud when using and the buzzer continues to beep even if you open the door, but aside from that it's a great microwave."
1,This bad boy lasted EXACTLY two years before finally deciding to kick the bucket I guess. We started getting this H97 code and looked it up and saw it’s not a problem we could fix without a professional. Not worth the headache. Wouldn’t recommend this microwave at all.
1,"Not only did this microwave never work properly with Bluetooth, it also took exactly 18 months for it to die unexpectedly. We used it sparingly as we do not microwave very often. That it would simply die after gentle use is a disappointment and a waste of money."
5,"I have suffered through a bad choice previously.  I had to resort to using a used one from my parents.  I was not a fan of that panel, but lived with it until it died after 18 years in use by them and me.  This Farberware model is exactly what I wanted in every respect.  The panel buttons are simple to understand and this has more features than I had previously.  I am thrilled with this purchase.  I waited a month to submit a review.  How can one rate a product like this immediately upon delivery?  I cannot and would not.  It is a preference thing.  I love this microwave, but it won't necessarily be your favorite.  Thanks for reading."
4,"Looks good, but the buttons don't work well (I have to press more than once for it to work).I almost burned my fingers several times because the bottom of the bowl or plate is very hot.I heard this microwave is heating from the bottom up, but the ceramic bowl or plate is absorbing most of the heat, while the food on top is not hot enough."
5,"I've been using it 2-3 times a week for about 3 months and it has exceeded my expectations.  5 star review because this thing actually does everything it says it does! Who'd've thunk? You can safely purchase this. It's even easier to use than the YouTube videos would have you think. (Mostly because it's just a very reliable microwave with a capable toaster oven built in. The future is now.)I had a smaller competent LG microwave and a countertop Black & Decker convection oven (aka toaster oven with a fan) that may as well have been my brother. The microwave died. I was reluctant to get rid of my trusty Black & Decker along with the old microwave to make counter space for this but it was absolutely worth it.A couple of other reviews mention taking your time and slowly working your way through the different modes. Excellent advice.  The following are test results in order of my experiencing them:Popcorn button test: 100% Nails it across multiple brands.Blindly adding time to reheat pizza test: 100% Nothing caught fire and the pizza was evenly heated.Pizza reheat button: 100% *chef's kiss*Potato button(!?): 100% Everybody needs to know how to microwave a potato. It's healthier, tastier, and more cost effective than ramen. And potatoesrule! If you weren't raised with the ancestral knowledge of microwaving potatoes, this microwave has it.Using the pre-programmed thawing for frozen meat, and bread: 95% This is never an ideal thawing method but it works really well here. Nothing was actually cooked and everything was evenly thawed.""Air fry"" some frozen nuggets (from frozen): 100% Sometimes you need those nuggets from the red bag and this has your crispy childhood craving covered.Broil some diy English muffin pizzas: 100% AGAIN! Why not microwave a mini pizza? The bread gets soggy. Why not bake it? In a small convection oven like this the toppings may blow around. I hope you have learned something.""Baking"" a 9x9 enchilada casserole for 30min at 350°: 100% Good grief! I was very hesitant to even attempt this but the oven in my apartment is a joke and it's summer. The cooking time and temp fell within the capabilities listed in the microwave instructions. Followed the microwave instructions for convection cooking and it came out great. Cheese bubbled on the edges, brown on top, and evenly cooked. Took it to a party.Microwaving a 16oz frozen lasagna: 100%...just because you can doesn't mean you should.Thanks for reading! If you're at all interested in it, just buy it. You'll enjoy the thrill of having an appliance that delivers on its promises and your accompanyimg sense of superiority."
5,This little beauty far surpassed my expectations.  Easy to use.  Not too many presets.  Sleek.  And...it cooks better than my old 1500 watt microwave.Wahoo!!!
4,Don't know if it was the coating inside or the fact of microwaves. But health warning. I returned it.
2,Worked great until the display went out after 2 years.
3,"Overall it's an ok unit for the price of what I paid back then (not current price). However, after a year and a half the inside plastic coating started peeling and coming off exposing the innards. After the item's provided warranty of course. If you want one for a year then good choice, but not much longer than that."
1,"Will never buy a Toshiba microwave again! In the first month the light inside started flickering. In less than 3 months, it went out. It’s almost impossible to get into the unit to change the bulb. Two years later and it’s all rusted out around the door jam. Very disappointing. Not at all durable. I’ve never had a microwave this badly made."
5,"I am 75, but with my little two-wheeled hand dolly, I brought the box into the garage, up three steps into the kitchen all by myself... and that was important to me !  It works great, simple instructions, and fit my budget !"
3,"If a correct time display is important to you, look elsewhere -- unless there is never a need to change the time, such as daylight savings time.  My unit will not retain the new time input, and at some point always reverts back to the original standard time.  I have been in touch with Toshiba regarding troubleshooting tips, but nothing has remedied the problem.Also, I am not pleased about functionality of the Cook Time / Clock button.  I have to question the wisdom of Toshiba's R&D in deciding that requiring the user to press the Cook Time / Clock button TWICE to set a cook timer is a good idea.  (Yes, the order of the words on the microwave is reversed as to function.)Since the clock is rarely changed (except in my case, which is frequently), wouldn't it make more sense to have the button set up as one press for cook time, and two for resetting the clock??  Of course, one can always ask Alexa to set a cook time ... but I do not always feel like talking to Alexa.  :D"
2,"This microwave served us well (and often) but only for 13 months. Without any warning, multiple buttons stopped working and it no longer showed microwave setting times or elapsed times. We will not be purchasing another of these considering the cost and short lifespan."
1,"The oven seems to work well, but it is very hard to open and shut the door because there is no handle and it slides all over the slippery countertop when pushed or shoved against to operate the door.It's a good size for heating a cup of beverage or heating the dog's dinner.  It's a great value for the money!I take it all back.  It was impossible to make the settings work.  I called for a warranty replacement, and this is where my headaches were exasperated.  I was sent to a place called Englewood Marketing Group.  They said they would send me a new unit and it would arrive from someplace called Nostalgic Products.  I got an email from them saying that it was being shipped FedEx.  I tried tracking it and FedEx said there was no such tracking number.  I went back to my email to check the tracking number and it disappeared right in front of my eyes!!  I DO NOT recommend Farberware Microwave ovens."
5,"I love this microwave / convection oven / air fryer / broiler.I’ve been using my instant pot air fryer for air frying & making toast; however, this new microwave is so much better.Highly recommend!"
4,"Moved from a home with a 1200’watter, so a bit spoiled, but it functions as expected"
2,Disappointed  ! The turn table very sluggish and loose. Play in the plastic  turn table shaft that the glass plate sits on and play between the glass turn table plate and the plastic turn table adapter . When it turns it makes lots of noise like the plate will come off the plastic shaft adapter.
2,"Product worked fine for 10 days, then the control panel was dead. The light inside was fine. It came from n when the door opened, but no other function. Item was returned for credit."
5,Replaced an 8 year old Sharp microwave that started arcing inside.  I know that electronic devices fails from power surges so the sharp microwave was understandable.This Panasonic model NN-SN67K meets all our needs.
2,"Cute little microwave, but panel isn’t durable.  Button surface (where fingers push) already cracked after less than one year of light use."
1,This microwave was never powerful.  Slowly each of the buttons stopped working and now it is almost completely dead.  The only number which works is 4 and it randomly turns on and off now. Replacing shortly. Only good thing is I guess it is small?
1,"The media could not be loaded.Waited forever to get the product, the product came damaged with some buttons not working. Now have to return it and wait again for a new microwave. What a hassle!!"
5,"Absolutely love it so far, it's an amazing upgrade over my RV propane oven. Definitely a learning curve though, and the manual in the packaging is not much help"
1,"This was a gift for my parents. When the microwave arrived, it looked fine, but when they tried to heat something it did not work. Their warranty asks that I ship the microwave back to them, which will cost more than the microwave itself, then wait 6 to 8 weeks for a replacement. Wish I did not waste my money."
4,Like the microwave.  Runs quietly.  Only the LED  clock lights up.  Need flashlight to see programming buttons.
5,"I like this because it made a great gift, it's good for small areas, looks nice and works great. Easy to operate and easy to clean."
1,"Only after one year, this Toshiba microwave oven stopped working (no power). I thought its fuse was blown off.  I changed the fuse, but still no power.  Now it is a piece of junk for disposal."
1,This broke on the cheap plastic arm.
2,The microwave was great! For about a month... one night it started to make noise and it fried itself. Did not buy any additional warranties so we just threw it out. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,"This is the worst microwave I have ever owned in my life. Terrible heating. Cook/heat food ridiculously uneven. One third is piping hot, one third warm and what’s left is cold. You can’t just turn on for not even a minute and expect your food to be heated. You gotta do 30 second intervals were you stop and stir constantly. Sometimes with this so called new technology, the changes they make suck. Hate I bought this thing. Should’ve just sent with my first instinct and bought a regular old fashioned microwave."
5,Recently moved to a smaller house with no OTR microwave. Decided to save space with this unit and replace our stand alone air fryer. Unit is SUPER quiet compared to the stand alone air fryer. Also cooks much more evenly than our previous air fryer. I highly recommend this one.
4,Time will tell how well this microwave which comes in black stainless and a grill last hence why I have it four stars.  I've never had the pleasure of using a microwave with a grill so I'm a little trepidatious as to the capabilities and function over time.  I love the chic black color which will go perfectly with our soon to be ordered black stainless stove and refrigerators.  It works like a charm but I haven't used the grill feature yet but once I do and as long as it holds up well I will be sure to update my review for higher rating should it warrant!
5,For what it's meant for.
3,Don't like that it's so light you have to hold on to it to open and close the door!!
3,Good microwave until light burnt out. Sad nothing you can do to fix it.
5,This microwave  is very  nice.  I  only gave  it a 4 on warmth because  it  doesn't  warm fast but it  is  really  not  a problem.
4,Great microwave for our office. Compact and works well. Comes with extra button sheets in case they wear off too
5,I am very happy with it..work perfect …
1,"The media could not be loaded.Update: I purchased this microwave on March 28th 2017. It has been screeching, moaning, & grinding for 2 months with light use. Thankfully it has a 1 year manufacturers warranty. I contacted customer service on 10/2/17. The warranty & phone number is on the back of the microwaves instruction manual.I called 877-648-5973. I was asked for my name, address, phone number , date of purchase, where I purchased it from, what was wrong with the microwave, etc:  I was then asked for the information on the back of the microwave. Model number, serial number , manufacturer number , & FCC ID number. I took pictures of the labels on the back of the microwave before I called customer service.I provided all of the information that was requested from me. The customer service representative instructed me to send a copy of my receipt to ""customerservice@icallservices.com"". DO NOT send any information to the email address listed on the back of the instruction manual. Call them first.I was told that I would receive a call from them shortly before they send out a replacement microwave. The customer service representative said that this takes about 3 weeks. If you don't have your receipt you can either print out a copy from your Amazon account or take a picture of your Amazon receipt & attach it to an email.Unfortunately the return window for Amazon had passed by the time my microwave started making weird grinding & screeching noises. The 1 year warranty definitely came in handy.2nd Update: As of 1/20/18 I’m still waiting on a replacement microwave from Farberware under my 1 year warranty. I’ve made countless calls only to be told that SAMANTHA is the only supervisor. Samantha is the only person with the LIST of replacement microwave shipment dates.Samantha is always in a meeting, just left, or she won’t be arriving for another 30 minutes. When I call back Samantha is in a meeting. I will never buy another Farberware product. I think they’re giving me the run around until March when my warranty expires. I’m going to file a complaint with the BBB.If I knew then what I know now I would’ve never spent my hard earned money on a Farberware microwave.3rd Update: Today March 1st 2018 I finally received my replacement microwave (warranty) from Farberware. A total of 5 months after I requested a replacement under my warranty. It was delivered out of the blue by UPS at 6:45pm today. The microwave is brand new. I’ve included a side by side pic of the old & new (unboxed) microwave.I’m not excited. I’m already wondering what’s wrong with this one.4th Update: May 16th 2018. The new replacement microwave that I received on March 1st 2018 is making noises. I’ve included a video this time. I’m cooking a TV dinner. I’m sooooo done with Farberware.😅😂"
5,"Great small form factor, that can still fit all of my plates. It cooks my food in about half the time of my very old microwave."
5,I LOVE MY stainless steel and black microve! IT CAME VERY QUICKLY WITHOUT INCIDENT! IT WORKS LIKE A CHAMP! I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE AS WELL AS THE PROMPTNESS AT WHICH IT WAS SHIPPED I ORDERED IT AND BELIEVE IT CAME A DAY EARLY!  Asthetically I am also very thrilled..its a beautiful looking microwave That coordinates well with all my other stainless kitchen accessories....thank you for a great price and great product!Karen WarviMckinleyville CA.
4,"We are just now starting to use the microwave. It is a little bigger than the one we had. So far it is working as we expected it to work. I just hope we get as many years out of this microwave as we did in the one that died, which was also a Panasonic."
3,"I have not used the microwave very much yet, however, the greatest disappointment is that the black screen on the door makes it very difficult to see into the oven when something is cooking.  I am used to watching for the beginning of a boil or bubbling which just isn’t possible with this oven."
2,This is the second unit I have purchased because the first one failed free 14 months.This second one is mouser than the first one.
4,"I had to find a microwave to replace the 2002 model at my father's house. Using the same external  measurements this was the closest model I could find, however when it arrived the internal measurements were slightly smaller. Fortunately for his needs the area was big enough. It does look nice."
3,"First, it's ok. It does it's job. But the more I use this microwave, the more I hate it.The turntable doesn't stay in place well. I'm always having to put it back.The buttons aren't very responsive. Sometimes they just don't.I hate the beep (it's long), although I'm hoping maybe I can adjust it.It's mediocre about heating - sometimes it's ok, sometimes it doesn't seem to do anything."
5,This microwave was perfect for our small office space.
2,"Got my microwave.No damages in shipping.Turntable didn't work.Reached out to Amazon support, they sent me to Panasonic (which they did as they should).Could not get ahold of Panasonic support even tried a couple days. No assistance.Finally said forget it.I cut open my own brand new microwave, and found the turntable motor inside the metal housing.It wasn't plugged in.They must be putting these things together too quickly and lacking proper QC."
5,Microwave is very quiet but heats nicely. Very sleek looking. Recommend if you’re in the market for a smaller microwave.
3,Thought it was much larger
5,"This microwave is PERFECT. No extra buttons to press to program. Large, easy-to-see numbers. It runs quietly. I like the handle vs. the push-in release. It is the right size for my cabinet space."
5,"The microwave is easy to use. Buttons respond quickly, and cooks hot as according to pre-temp settings. The  Chefman is not loud, but this one is a bit small, which may result in a low noise when cooking."
3,So light I have to use a teflon dish drainer under it to keep it from scooting around when I close the door.  No light on face to show numbers when using it when light is low in room.  Other than that it works as any 700 watt should.
2,"Even on the highest power setting, it takes forever to heat stuff up. That said, it does eventually heat, but it took 5 minutes to heat up a 4 minute Healthy Choice meal. As long as you’re willing to mix and reheat a couple of times, this is great for small spaces."
1,"Strong electrical burning smell only after 7 months of purchase.  Only used basic functions like heating up water and warming food.  We never used the air fryer  As other reviews have noted, better to throw this in garbage than risk an electrical fire."
4,"The air frying is rather slow compared to my old dead stand-alone Air Fryer. It does work otherwise'SO FAR"",  It seems well made and is mostly easy to use except for you have to be in earshot to hear the preheat and turn over beeps.  That is going to be a bit of a pain but I am guessing that is the same for other convection and airdrying devices.  It is kind of cool to see it continue rotating the coffee cup until the handle comes back the way you put it in.  It deals so nicely with one of my pet peeves about microwaves when heating a mug.  It's just a nice little touch."
4,All modes work great and save energy when cooking for my son and I.Make no sense heating up the regular oven when you can use this unit.Only downfall is not having a hard copy of owners operating manual. It is avalble as pdf to download.
5,Nice and very good 👍🏻
1,when I put the glass tray on the  floor it shattered into a lot of pieces.  I cannot find a new one due to the coronavirus. and when I looked online for a replacement. Rca wanted $55 or it.
2,"It works okay, but is too small and makes a noise when the tray is rotating. I would not buy this again."
2,I have never used a microwave whose buttons were soooooooo hard to press. literally took all my strength
3,"It’s a decent microwave, but you can do a lot better for a few bucks more.Some issues.- No clock.- Need two hands to open.- Door sags.- Dark interior does not reflect light.  Makes it hard to see inside.Unit is so light you need one hand to keep the entire unit from rotating when you open the door."
3,It was great until it wasn't. Great for small spaces. Easy to clean. Next time I'll buy higher power. It lasted one year and eight months. Disappointing.
1,"won't let me return item...I have to start, then stop, then start again for it to begin working"
3,"The pictures of these two models look exactly the same. I got (I think) a steal of a deal for it, ordering on Thanksgivng day, but the question is whether Amazon is trying to renege on return of it if something about it is defective. I've only used it to mcrowave a couple times, and so far, I like it, except for a few things. The print on the control panel, is charcoal gray on a black backgound, making it exceedingly hard to read the controls. That's nasty! Also, it came with only a 6 page booklet (covering mostly safety cautions, cleaning, and troubleshooting), plus a one page insert regarding the air frying function. I had to go online to find the 48 page .pdf user manual. Even with that, I could find no explanation of the difference between combi1 and combi2, and for which foods each is preferable. I have had to print out certain charts in the user manual in order to have even the faintest clues as to things like the various air fry presets, when to use the tall rack vs the short rack, what microwave power setting are appropriate for different tasks. For example it says the power 1 setting is good for softening butter, but doesn't suggest how long is recommended per stick.In the .pdf manual's chart entitled ""select the best method of cooking,"" the entries in the chart are either NR, 1, or 2. I assume NR means not to use that function for a particular food, but what do 1 or 2 mean. I would assume it doesn't mean minutes, for that would mean nothing ever gets cooked by any method for mre than 2 minutes, including any of the foods cooked by convection baking. So does 1 mean ""this is the preferred method"" and 2 mean ""this method usually does not work out as well for this particular food""? Just what do those ones and twos in the chart mean?! Given these complaints, I am giving this oven 3 stars. I may upgrade or downgrade my rating as I use this oven more."
3,"We just need a small thing to reheat coffee and the occasional baked potato. So this is fine.  It's nice looking and has a small footprint. However, they really mean it, it needs space around it on the side and top. The top will get very hot, and if it's covered or too close to anything that will be a problem. The door and handle are made of plastic, which feels a little cheap to me.  If you have to leave this on your counter and you care about nice quality things that may bother you as it does me.  But all that said, it looks ok and it does what we need it to do."
4,Love this microwave oven. It does everything a microwave should and more. I mainly use it to heat up food and toast pizza and bread with the air fryer. I am sure it is not as great as regular air fryer but I like that it's 3 in 1 and not needing to much appliances.
5,"The product so far performs well. We will see in time if this continues.  However, so far I give this product a 👍🏾 It performs as expected."
1,"I only had these microwave for just four months and I was using it and it started sparkling flame ,so my husband unplugged it . I would like for the seller to give me back my money .Elsa"
2,The media could not be loaded.Didn't last long. A lot of the buttons don't work. Display doesn't show time any more. Probably lasted less than a year.
5,Nice small microwave that cooks like a big one. Great for dorm room environments.
1,Bought Mar 2021. Have major issues with the inside paint flaking off and rusting and then the inside caught fire! Looks like I'm not the only one this has happened to. Bad product buyer beware.
3,"Snacks mostly, warming leftovers."
5,"So far so good. The microwave and air fryer modes work very well (haven't tried the oven setting yet), but keep an eye on it! The recommended times (on the actual frozen dinner type foods) on what I've microwaved are a bit much (especially fish sticks), and the air fryer mode is great, but the recommended settings in the manual are a more than bit of overkill on what I've cooked, but there is always a learning curve. And with sensor cooking, scrambled eggs are amazing! I love this thing so far!!"
4,El artículo está como lo esperaba fácil de usar
4,"simple, easy to use, does not  blow fuses with its 700watts of power. Fit perfect for the small room/dorm."
3,open and close button is awful. Who inspects these things  As long as they make money no one caresl
5,"A little hard to set up, but worth the time. Nice size and helpful time suggestions."
1,"My last microwave didn't last to long. It wasn't a Toshiba. My old one was a 700 watt unit which was a little small. So, this time I got a 900 watt unit. I had a little more space than I originally thought. It works nicely for a low budget item. Sometimes I need to run the microwave longer because not everything got hot. If it lasts me another year, I'll be happy. Who knows one day I'll be able to afford a bigger and better microwave. In the meantime I have hot food.UPDATE: I have dropped the star rating to a 1 star. If I could make it a no star I would. I have had this thing a little less than a year and snap, crackle, pop it died. Those were the sounds it made for the last few days then nothing. I thought Toshiba made better things. Well I won't make that mistake again."
3,"Works ok. But it’s very loud—for a microwave. Almost makes you think something is wrong with it. We’d probably return it but at the cup in and wattage, it’s the only one that would fit in the prebuilt cabinet space.It works fine and the preset buttons are handy."
4,Works great.. as far as the size goes.. only a standard dinner plate will fit in the microwave.  happy customer!
1,"Shuts off 5 seconds after starting. Sometimes it doesn't shut off at all without heating. No matter what button you press it won't shut off you have to unplug it. I would have upgraded but only the Panasonic models were available and I was concerned that the problem was systemic, so I returned the item.I will say this, returning couldn't have been any easier. Amazon took all of my frustrations and made it a pleasant experience."
3,"Looks stunning in our kitchen, and works really well.  It's just very loud."
2,"Quite loud.  Food not heated evenly.  Interior light is quite weak and does poor job illuminating the dark black interior.  Turntable seems to ""stick"" once in a while.  Overall, not worth the money.  Returned."
5,"So far it works great and it's the perfect size. I can fit a large dinner plate in it, but it doesn't take up too much space on my counter. Note that even though I can fit a large plate it in, the plate won't spin and there is no option to turn off the turntable, so I just remove the turntable when I put a big plate in."
4,"Nice unit... Plug and play. The programing sequences for each operation takes some study, but does make sense. Once learned, easy as pie. Nice unit... nice price."
4,"I am not going to lie, this microwave works great, the problem with it is the push buttons are so dark as to be unable to be seen even in a fully lit kitchen. The numbers are so thin, the entire push button pad is so dark as to be useless. To see it, I need to use a flashlight in a fully lit kitchen. Bad design beyond believable.Maybe take some of the power from the blue led for the clock and put some of it into lighting the pad."
4,"I'll admit that this was purchased as a less expensive clone of my last one.  My last microwave was a Toshiba which started having issues with things like the light not working days after purchasing, but lets face it most microwaves are made in the same plant in China and stamped with different names, so this time around I thought I might as well spend less on the same cheap microwave.  This is clearly the same model at a different price point.  Upon arrival things did not start off well as it does not sit evenly on the shelf and I had to put a shim under the rear left leg.  It has a darker interior some might not like, but otoh it might hide stains more if it needs to be cleaned.  It has cheaper feeling buttons and makes cheaper sounding less pleasant beeping noises, but so far seems to work fine, and there was zero learning curve since the buttons are in the same spots and do the same things.  This is a major point in it's favor, easy to use straightforward intuitive buttons.  I would have considered a more pricey LG or something but they had needlessly complicated controls.  If you want a basic microwave that does the job at a relatively reasonable price and don't mind shimming one leg and putting up with the cheesy sounds this one seems to do the job, and you quickly get used to the somewhat tinny nature. This display may be a touch brighter or easier to read.  Clone models with other brands stamped on the front cost about $40 more.  If it stays working well I will be satisfied."
1,"I bought this microwave because I needed a smaller unit to fit in my tiny kitchen.  It fit the bill and worked great for almost two years.  A couple of weeks ago, the microwave began making a weird rattling noise when in use and then flames shot out from the inside panel.  I have contacted Toshiba customer support and they are sending me a partial refund.  Of course it's past the warranty period (purchased 6/1/20).  But as another reviewer said, buyers should beware, don't only read the top ratings like I did.  This microwave isn't safe!  I guess I should consider it lucky that I got almost two years now that I've read what others have said but I don't enjoy thinking about the fire hazard that I dodged.  I loved it for its size and it functioned well until recently but I will never buy another Toshiba microwave!"
5,"Great for small spaces in the kitchen, dorm rooms, or apartments. Works perfect and easy to use! Definitely recommend"
1,"the handle is secured by small metal pins or screws at the top and bottom. The bottom one broke. Very difficult to open without the handle, and no way to repair it. superglue didn't work, and no way to replace the screw."
5,"A great microwave that has a cool defrost mode.Most microwaves SUCK at defrosting.This one actually defrosts without cooking the crap out of the food.Just put in the weight of the food, and boom, defrosted.It's pretty accurate on cooking times too.Haven't had any issues with partial heating.Only complaint is the interior is a little hard to clean and the door doesn't always feel like it closes properly.No solid ""thunk"" when closing it without having to slam the door shut.Otherwise, great microwave"
5,"I have now only had a fully formed one of these for about 16 hours after a week of ...a lot of dumb.The one piece important item to pass on to you from that is to verify the mica heatwave guard is intact on the right of the machine. Be careful and do not tear it. Why?-Ge does not make the part for it. They'll talk about ordering another size you can cut down but won't verify it's the same material.- They'll also say you can use it without this guard, but don't do this without research first. What I've found is this little piece of mica paper protects your machine and makes it last exponentially longer.- They'll say 3rd party will negate the warranty while recommending you run it without.- Their CSRs are actually quite nice. It's just the company policy is terrible.(My opinion on this is anger. A whole microwave should not be trashed due to a piece that's built to be replaced....)I digress. Yea, I've only had it for 16 hours but I've run its paces to make sure nothing else is wrong. (I've been through a number of these now due to missing or damaged parts. Fyi: I was doing open box excellent/like new from all companies I was working with so I would not assume this is a base issue with GE but an issue with returned items not receiving a proper inspection for damage or missing items.)Now. Finally, what I think of it.Yall, I've never spent more than $50 on a Microwave. Granted, the original one I spent $50 would be more lile $100 now due to inflation but still. Considering you can buy a decent airfryer or convection toaster oven for under $100... this product is still more money...BUT as long as it is large enough for you (you can look up specs and the full user manual on GEs website...The full manual teaching you how to use it does not come in the box. It only gives you SOME direction. )It's worth it.Why?  I now have ONE device instead of three. It lives up to it's name. For those of us that have tiny/efficiency kitchens this is HUGE.  This alone makes it worth its weight in gold.It works. The baking function works. The air fry function works...and I've never had or used anyone else's microwave where the popcorn function didn't under or overcook popcorn....Even IT worksYes, the buttons are not lit ...so place it at eye height, somewhere well lit...or get one of those USB strip lights to mount next to it. But tbh... 300 more for lit buttons (based on reading reviews of other similar products) just doesn't cut it. There's some great videos out there comparing different 3 in 1s and I feel like this one is being underserved for the more expensive ones.  Which I'd hope for 150% price increase to be... 150% better... but I'm unsure what this thing would have to do better for that to be the case. (Other than needing a larger oven.)All in all...even if you struggle financially if you can find a way to squeeze it... do it.Potentially buy a warranty for it if that's the case? They're fairly cheap for a 2 year... I did.For GE if you need to warranty through them it's a 6 to 8 week process. Yike. Idk about y'all but I can't be without my main cooking source for that long. I purchased from Best Buy in the end (while at one point I had purchased from Amazon) and their warrenty was like...$25. Worth.  It.And final note on the mica boards: I bet 3rd party mica boards are fine for some day when mines old and yucked to simthereens.... and then I'll use one of those to keep this thing going as it'll likely be well beyond warranty by that point.  If you're having trouble with your microwave definitely look in to these items instead of replacing your microwave... but if you want to replace it. Consider this."
4,It does what it is suppose to do.  A basic microwave.
4,"This microwave works great. As a single person, I needed a small oven that would accommodate a dinner plate. My only complaint is that the function panel isn't bright enough. I use a tiny flashlight to make sure that I press the correct time."
5,"Intuitive good functions, just like its bigger cousins.  Quality seems good. ... half the price of  a small Panasonic that failed in less than 12 days.  So far all good - well done GE.  Hope it lasts"
2,"This NN-SN67KS Inverter Microwave by Panasonic worked fine for 17 months. Then the power unit failed. The display says H97, which according to Panasonic, means the power system for the micrewave has failed. This unit should have lasted for years. We kept it clean, seldom used it longer than 6 minutes, and it still failed. I do not reccoment this microwave."
4,Clock didn’t work when I received the microwave. After many calls it became to much of a hassle to return it.
3,Small compact keyboard unlit not visible in the dark  You have to hold it down from sliding when operating keyboard.  I’m up grading very soon.
2,"Toshiba EM925A5A-BS Microwave Oven:Two Year Update:=============The turntable no longer functions.  This device will be discarded and replaced by a different brand.First the light bulb quit, and now the platter rotator.  This is the shortest lived microwave oven I have ever owned.I will never buy another Toshiba product - ever!  Not anything at all.==========================================================================================The most disappointing characteristic of this oven has been the lower than average heating ability.  My previous two microwave ovens were in the 1100 to 1200 watt power range.  This oven is only 900 watts and that does make a noticeable difference in the amount of time and the power setting needed for typical heating and cooking.After about seven months of use, the interior light began flashing wildly.  When it first began, it was really alarming as I thought it was arcing.Over time, it became more and more erratic.  Now, the light only rarely blinks in very short bursts.To get that repaired, I would have to carry it to a repair facility, have not microwave oven to use for 3 to 7+ days, and then have to carry up stairs again. That is unacceptable.The door has a sensible design with an open handle that can be easily grabbed with either a person's right or left hand.Also, there is no mechanism or push button to break, which did happen with my last oven.The smaller physical size, compared to typical 1.0 or 1.1 cubic feet ovens, is a welcome difference.The ""ready"" beeper sounds five (5) times when heating ends.  Three times is sufficient, four times is a bit annoying, five times is just obnoxious.The beeping does not stop if you press the ""STOP"" button.Fortunately, it is fairly easy to turn the sound 'Off'.Overall, the oven is not very loud and sound level is not objectionable.My Delivery Experience:The delivery of this item was timely enough, but it was not delivered to my apartment door.There was no delivery attempt notice left at my apartment door.It was delivered instead to the rental management office.The original manufacturers shipping box which has 'punch in' handles, was put into another larger box.The outer box did not have any 'punch in' handles and was more difficult to carry.I am 70+ years old and I had to carry the unwieldy heavy box up two flights of stairs!The delivery person was likely less than half my age.  I was certainly not happy."
3,"I just moved into an apartment with a tiny kitchen and have very limited counter space.  I don’t think I could use anything bigger than this one. However, it looks nice and goes with the little fridge and range that came with the apartment.  The issue I have with the microwave is that the touch pad is not very responsive and sometimes the buttons just refuse to work.  I had a regular over the range microwave in my house that did that and eventually stopped working altogether.  So I’m apprehensive about this one."
1,I am very disappointed that I didn't purchase the extended warranty on this microwave. I purchased the unit at the end of October last year and it isalready starting to die.The inside light stopped working a few months ago and now it makes a screeching noise when i turn it on. But all in all we didn't spend alot so I can't complain too much.
3,"The door won't open (unless you pry it open while pushing the open door button)... I've only had the microwave for 45 days (and it started becoming a problem 20 days ago but got much worse recently).Tried white lithium grease on the release mechanism... no luck.Next, I filed down one of the two ""catches""... that keeps it shut.  Then I slightly straighten the door (hingers and/or the connection must have been slightly off) by bumping the lower corner with my palm.  This made it it was squared to the main body so it would shut without the possibility of rubbing.It works perfect now!"
2,The plate does not stay on the grooves. They're too short. So your food doesn't properly rotate.
2,"I purchased this October 21,2021!. Only a year ago, and I have gradually lost service from the key pad. I did notice , shortly after receiving it, that buttons 1,4,7& 9 did not work.  This was when I was trying to set the clock. Now 2 and 8 have stopped working.  I use 30 second the most now to get what I want. It has always made a lot noise because the plate has nothing underneath to keep it from wobbling. I guess it won’t be long before I have to replace this. First time , I experience this with a small appliance  appliance and never expected it to be from a Toshiba  Bad choice…."
3,"The first one we ordered arrived with damage to the top metal.  The replacement unit we ordered arrived, and we try using it for a couple of days.  The size of the numbers on the controls are very small, and had to be pressed very hard for them to work.  I fought with it for a few days and gave up when it took me 4 or 5 tries to get anything entered.  It also started making some loud noises in use, so we returned that unit for a refund."
5,We are loving our new microwave/convection/broiler so far. We don’t plan on using air fry since we have an awesome air fryer already. Great value.
3,Makes a lot of weird noise. Beeps during run time.
4,"It is a nice looking microwave and the touchpad is easy to use.  Some microwaves you really need to jab the buttons and this functions nice overall.  The one comment I have is that it's not completely stainless steel, only the face plate is stainless, the rest is semi-gloss black.  If your expecting what I would call a ""stainless steel"" microwave, this is not your product.  But for a mid-range microwave to reheat food it works great and does look nice, even in black."
1,"Didn't catch that these are ""refurbished"" units."
4,"We do like this microwave. It cooks and reheats just like it is supposed to. The reheat sensor feature is nice and defrosting in a hurry is easy and convenient. What I do NOT like about it are the 2 features it DOESN'T have, and I had no idea how much I relied upon these features until we bought this unit that didn't have them. For the quick 30sec feature, you have to push the 30sec button, and then also push the start button. Why? The other feature missing is the reminding beep that something is in the microwave. I run a busy household and can't tell you how often something is forgotten inside. Of course we find it around the next meal time, but end up throwing the food away for spoilage."
3,"Depth is shown incorrect in the image. It shows 11.48”, however, as you can see I’m my image it is over 13”. This doesn’t include the handle or the cord on the back. Keep this in mind! Haven’t used it yet so can’t speak to the use."
4,"This seems to be a nice microwave. I am concerned about the many inverter failures I've read about, but in the end I was swayed by the positive reviews overall and from friends who swear by the inverters. It is very powerful, and in fact perhaps too powerful. Even the instructions suggest using a lower power level for most foods. I find myself using power level 8 a lot. Turbo defrost seems to work great. Cooking and defrost do seem to be even, and I think that is why most folks like the inverter models.Like others have said, the instant 30 second button requires a second button to start. I also find that annoying as my prior microwave started immediately upon the first press of the instant (1 minute) button. However in my case it is nice to have the 30 second button..so it is a trade-off for me. What's even nicer is that you can set the power level before using the instant 30 second button.The Sensor cooking option is inadequate. In my experience it barely warms my food even when I press the More button. So I can only used it as a first step, then use normal operation to finish the heating.The popcorn feature allows you to set it for different sized bags. However, in my first use of the feature it ended too soon and stopped before popping had even slowed (yes, I had correctly set the bag size).Appearance-wise, the microwave looks nice from the front, but the sides and top are rather plain. No effort was made by Panasonic to make it look attractive from the sides. I agree with others that it is difficult to read the text on the buttons. Not enough contrast. I guess once you get familiar with it you don't need to read them as much.The button to open the door is stainless steel, so it shows fingerprints all of the time. Why they would use stainless steel for such a button is beyond me. Emphasis on appearance over function perhaps, but in the end it looks ugly due to the ever-present smudges. I gave up trying to keep it smudge free...now only when expecting guests.Be sure to read the manual if you don't need some of the child-safety features that others are complaining about.I bought this to replace a 28 year old Samsung that I bought as a display model. It's too bad that Samsung quality is not what it used to be (I won't consider Samsung appliances nowadays). I'd even bet the 28 year old microwave in its new forever home will outlast this new Panasonic, but hey...it was only 700W, smaller capacity, and had fewer features. Still, I've no doubt it will serve its new owners well."
1,"Control panel defective, item returned when seller’s customer service said that was normal. Item returned."
4,I was worried that 700 Watts wouldn't be enough. But it's smaller microwave it doesn't need to be 1100. It works well even on big dinners it's a keeper.
4,"Small, cute, quiet, easy to learn and use. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition."
1,"It was a basic little microwave that did its job…but only lasted 3 months. None of the buttons work anymore, so it’s completely unusable."
1,By opening the box I could tell it was a return. Foam packing was in pieces. The microwave door doesn't close. I have to lift up on the door for it to close. Will be returning. Very disappointed that they would even send an item that was returned because of being faulty.
4,"I’ve been looking for a new microwave for at least a couple of months and I have read millions of reviews and I chose this one even though in a lot of the reviews there was an issue with the more and less button for time but after I read my manual, I figured out that’s not correct you can push zero until it gets to all zeros and then just put the time in and push start so far it’s cooked everything perfectly. I’ve had no problems with it and I’ll update y’all in a few months."
4,"1st words from my spouse at unboxing. Haven't fully familiarized myself with all the bells and whistles, but it's huge, it's powerful, and what used to take 2 minutes to heat a pint of coffee in our old one takes 30 seconds less with this one. Cooks much more evenly over the entire turntable than our older one, too. I don't give much of anything 5 stars but may with this one once I use it longer and learn all its capability."
2,"Used it twice to microwave raw potatoes (l and 2 on 2nd try)  Glass plate shifts back and forth, side to side.  Have adjusted the plastic rotatingarm and each time, within 3-4 seconds, it is hitting all sides.  Called in twice to service call to ask why.  No help on lst call (9 pm at night)No real help on 2nd call at 8 a.m. Sounded like same person from week before; He couldn't understand what I meant by glass platebumping all sides; first said there was supposed to be a rubber ring - I said there wasn't, please send me one. He indicated withoutoriginal order blank (Amazon) order, shipping confirmation, full description of model, S#, etc. they couldn't/wouldn't help.  On internet,found reference to NOT removing a cardboard liner as it was MIC treated.  I had  found a piece of cardboard inside unit, holding the glasstray in place on a styrofoam packing.  Watched a Youtube demo later of unpacking same microwave, American person speaking,there was nothing said about retaining a cardboard liner, nothing of a rubber ring. Looked at packing material again, nothing marked asneeded to be kept in microwave when in operation. Have adjusted the roller assembly multiple times  and within 3 seconds, plate sliding.  Again, none of the FAQ's address sliding plate. So far, I would NOT recommend the microwave, the manufacturer or the custom help division to anyone!Unit is black RCA RMW733, purchased 8-8,2017, delivered 8-10-l7, first tried 9-14 and again 9-18-2017.Also purchased extended warrantybut so far, the RCA warranty would suffice except it will be time consuming to repackage, transport to a shipper, etc."
5,We mostly use it to reheat leftovers but also use it to steam vegetables.
4,I like the size of the microwave... e.g. large enough for bigger casserole dishes & could even cook a small turkey. It is  fairly quiet and VERY easy to clean. The ease of cleaning in itself is why I gave it a 4 star rating. What I do not like about this microwave is that the buttons are difficult to push. I have to use my knuckle and not my finger to engage. My elderly dad cannot make it work for him.
3,The microwave is not level. Can't adjust the feet.  So we put something under the short leg to make it level.One occurence of the microwave's exterior getting hot.  Waiting to see if it does it again to investigate whether the microwave should be returned. Microwave purchased 08-04-23.
5,"It has a nice, sleek, shiny, and reflective look to it. It's working fine. However, we did just buy it, and so only time will tell how it holds up.I chose this Panasonic model because of a Toshiba kicking the bucket after only 2 years and 10 months. I've read that a good microwave should supposedly last 7 - 10 years. I'm expecting at least 7 years from this, and if it doesn't meet that limit, then I will update my review as I did for my past microwave."
4,Love it sleek and modern look. Great buy definitely recommend this item.
1,Had this product about 6 months and the turntable inside the microwave no longer spins while in use also if you turn it on for more than 3 minutes it turns itself off .  Would not recommend.
2,"It says ""air fryer"".  The instruction manual says almost nothing about air frying.  That function didn't work for us.  We just tried a frozen pizza.  After 24 minutes at 400 degrees (after preheating), the pizza which was on a rack was barely warm on the bottom.  We tried french frying potatoes.  They came out limp and soggy.  A steak was warm on the outside (not brown) and cool inside.  (I don't remember the time, except it was past what was suppose to work).  The top of the unit was quite hot to the touch.  The microwave function worked fine.  It's will be returned."
3,There was a sticker ensuring that the microwave door didn’t open (I guess). When I went to remove the glue that was left it took the paint right off as if it weren’t “cured” or something. Disappointed but too heavy and a huge hassle to take it to the UPS store. I suppose I’ll cover it with black marker or something. I did buy the refurbished one either. I bought “new”.
1,"This product was really good but you need to read this! I bought a robot vacuum last year. it made a weird sound so I returned it with UPS! Even though I contacted the customer service several times they told me that they can not refund me because they never got the package! I contacted UPS and received multiple confirmation that the package was delivered to the warehouse! So I contacted amazon multiple times after that, they told me that since more than two months have past they will not refund me! They didn't even send me the product back! and that was the last time I ordered anything from Amazon! They literary stole 200$ from me!"
3,I was so excited for this product to finally come in just for it to be ruined within minutes. A sticker was placed on the part where you input the time and when removing the sticker it ripped the film and also left behind a residue I still cannot remove. So far it’s functioning fine but it’s just frustrating that it’s already damaged.
5,Great product for small spaces when you don’t have counter space as you could see I placed on a small wall mounted shelf
4,I have had it for month now and no issues so far. It is great for small jobs.  This is not a very powerful microwave but the price is right.
1,"This microwave just traps the water vapor, and you will need to wipe the inside dry after every use or the water collects on the bottom, inside the oven, which is made of steel and will eventually rust out. I didn't realize this fact and initially, after only having the oven a short time, the wheels under the rotating tray rusted, which made a mess and added to the maintenance of this oven. I have owned this microwave oven now for a little less than three years, and the bottom of the unit has now developed a rusted out hole along the path of the tray rollers, so the tray does not rotate anymore. As of today, it no longer heats anything (although it does start and stop correctly according to the time that you set). I have purchased Panasonic products in the past, and generally had good experiences, but after purchasing this lemon Panasonic is on my do not buy list."
1,Gets way too hot. The functions do not work properly. does not cook evenly and I missed the window to  return by just a couple of days. I'm disgusted about the amount of money spent on something that is going in the garbage can.. not sure how to do a second review however I'm adding to my review I tried to use this one more time on microwave level to heat something up and it caught on fire and blew up after one minute this is the worst item I've ever bought
1,"The ad says there is a whole slough of additional features for softening butter, cooking bacon and more. They even have a sticker at the top inside of the door frame that tells you how to make the selection -- but look at the control panel?  Where are these features?  There is nothing in the user manual that says how to access them; therefore, they are non-existent.  This is a lie, and could subject this company to bait-and-switch laws.The ""Rate Features"" also says something about Alexa Integration"": what? this microwave has no bluetooth or wifi!"
4,This is a great microwave for the price; the only downsides are there’s no door handle “people tend to slam it while closing” and that it has gotten progressively louder than it was when I first had received it. It’s still pretty quiet though.Definitely work the $$$
5,Love this microwave but did not come with any instructions so I just had to figure it out with YouTube and google
3,It takes about a minute more to cook food when compared to our other microwave.
3,"Although I just recently purchased it, it already sounds like it is about to break any minute.  So far it works ok, but the motor whines extremely loudly and sounds like it is dying.  I took out the rotating tray to make sure noise isn't just the tray rattling around.  Even if it holds up long-term, the noise it makes is super annoying.  Maybe I just got a lemon  but I really can't recommend it based on my experience."
5,"My husband loves to cook. This all in one microwave, air fryer, conventional, broiler is fantastic. The only thing we both don't like is that the function settings panel isn't back lit. It's hard to see the function buttons."
1,Do not purchase.  This microwave worked for about 8 weeks and then the control panel quit operating.  Cannot get it to work no matter what I do.Extremely frustrated & surprised that Amazon would carry such a faulty product.  Also surprised - but I guess I shouldn't be - that RCA no longer stands for quality.  I regret this purchase & now have to buy another microwave.
5,A great microwave.  Fits perfectly on my counter.  Good quality.  Highly recommend.
5,"Started okay but only after two months, product is making unusual noises and having trouble spinning around. Called Amazon and was told only had 30 days to return so not their problem. Very disappointed in Amazon and in the microwave. Unhelpful customer service too!"
1,"I never got to use it , when i received it was all dented up, and i couldn't use it"
3,The delivery and packaging were outstanding. The microwave works well. It sounds like a freight train coming through the kitchen when running.
1,This item is having electrical issues.  Smells like wires are burning when used and have not had for a year yet.  the smell is very strong. It was purchased July 2021. I would not but it again or recommend to anyone. We threw it out.
3,Bought thinking I could from a review I read.  But in contacting the manufacturer there is no mute routine.This means if you have it near a bedroom they will be hearing the constant beeping.  Also the door opening and closing is very loud.Also 1 minute rotation is not one circle around so your cup is in the back.Should of done my homework better.
5,"I picked out this item when my ""ancient' Compact microwave  finally  gave out - that is,  still operated like the good little reliable soldier it's been for some 25 years!  but no heat! I  had very little additional room  for a new one.  This great, if modest-by-most-standards appliance - went beyond my expectations! Also it's modestly priced!  I love it, with nice features did not even expect!  Perfect for a single person who does  most real ""cooking"" in a conventional stove or toaster oven."
2,"I don’t believe this lives up to the claim of being a 1000 watt unit. It barely warms a cup of coffee in 30 seconds. It’s noisy, emits steam when opened. I had a 1000 watt Emerson for years . It was an outstanding unit in comparison."
2,"This microwave is terrible. You can’t add time to it while it is going. It smells weird, I’ve never had a microwave have this smell before. It takes longer to heat food. The plastic that covers the buttons got messed up within a week."
5,Grand daughter wanted this for Christmas present & I like the name brand & price was right. Being that it is stainless steel to match her other appliances. Know that she will love it and use it often.  Husband in & out of hospital so I was able to shop Amazon this year with ease from my home. In the future I plan to use your services more.
4,"If you want a big powerful microwave, this Panasonic is for you. It has got all the features you need in an attractive package but it has some strange quirks. First, the interior light when the unit is on is very dim. It appears brighter in the picture than it is. Second, the LED display is small and doesn't provide very useful information. Third, the labels on the keypad are difficult to read though I do like the buttons. Finally, the door is very clunky -- yes, I mean clunky in that when you close it, it sounds loud and hollow.Overall, this is a 2021 unit with a 1985 user interface. I think it was the right choice, and the price is right, but a more usable device would have been great."
1,"Don’t buy this.As others experienced, this microwave caught fire less than a week after instal.Amazon/Black&Decker  needs to “stop sale” and recall this item.If you have one don’t use it. Seriously  don’t use it!There is some  Manufacture defect with this model."
4,When we got it in the mail we thought it would be bigger but it was small in stand.  It does what is suppose to do but the turn table doesn't like to stay on the rods sometimes.  It is easy for my parents to operate and to warm up there food.  It was wroth the price.
3,I unplugged the microwave and it reset and is working now. Still noisy but functions.
1,Purchased and worked great for 6 months.  One day just shut off and wouldn’t turn back on.
3,"It's ok.. but you get what you pay for. Small, no door handle, push button to open and it slides all over the counter. Super Light weight, I bought it cause I needed a replacement fast, but I'll spend more for one in my Kitchen and move this one upstairs. It's small enough for a bedroom suite."
3,"We've had it for about 2 months now and when you press the button to open the door, the door seems to stick. So you have to press multiple times in order to get the door to open. Pain in the butt."
3,"The ""air fry"" setting is actually just a convection oven. I have a convection oven. I had an air fryer and a microwave oven. I wanted to do away with one of the appliances on my countertop. I thought this would be a perfect solution."
4,"The media could not be loaded.I use this daily. I use this microwave oven to reheat food, cook food, prepare pasta, soup, rice, poultry, fish. It is very easy to use and you can walk away after you set the proper time. It is not the best air fryer though. So if you're buying it for air fryer no. But the microwave oven is top notch gets meals prepared hot and ready quickly minimum mess."
2,Too slow
3,I was looking for a microwave for my home office for the purpose of warming up coffee. What arrive is a giant size microwave that is too large to put in my office or anywhere in my house. I have an outbuilding behind my house where I put this huge item. It works fine but just not in a convenient place.
5,"Delivery of the oven was very quick. I wanted to try everything out to make sure it worked. We warmed up coffee for the same amount of time as our other micro and it was the same heat. Then I baked a cake and it cooked evenly at the same time and temperature that the box suggested. The preheat took about 8 mins I think. Then I cooked frozen waffle cut French fries with the autobake feature. I put them directly on the racks and cooked a 20oz package. They came out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The unit does get hot on the outside but not enough to burn you. You will need your manual to know how to work this oven. Also, you can fit a 9x13 dish but but it won’t turn on the turntable if the side handles are to large. I used a Pyrex that fit right inside my 9x13 that would turn. So far I am super satisfied."
4,While this is easy to use I was surprised by its size. It's bigger than the image depicts. It's a little noisy but I'm ok. Its not a horrific noise.
2,Lasted only 2 years. It had problems early on but I hoped it would resolve itself. But ended with sparks flying and smoke! Better warranty would help!
3,"This was our first Panasonic as we have always used Sharp.  Our last Sharp did  not last, maybe 2 years, as the previous.  I also noticed the lower rating received by Sharp.  Ordered the Panasonic due to ratings.  First unit returned as it was VERY noisy, rattled when run, sounded like the fan was hitting a wire.  Talked to Amazon, said I could return.  Decided to try for a while to see what would happen,  Still noisy.  Called A and they contacted Panasonic.  Panasonic tech agreed it did not sound right.  Could drive 45 miles one way to a service depo or pay my own shipping to have it reviewed.  Called A for a return and replace.  New unit is OK.  Door sounds cheap when closed.  Probably won't buy a Panasonic next time.  Amazon really stepped up and took care of us while Panasonic was meh..."
5,My kitchen
3,"I really like the way it worked, until it didn't. Only had it for 4 months before it didn't work. An error code of H98 came up. I looked up what the code meant, it means if ""Fried"" and less expensive to buy a new one than to have it repaired. Too bad, I really liked the way it heated food food evenly and without a mess of exploding food or bubbling over. Will not buy again. Gave it one star.UPDATE: Since we couldn't return the microwave to Amazon we didn't know what to do with it. After one month of it not working I went directly to the Panasonic website and did a live chat with someone who was very helpful. We went through a long reset with many steps, but it worked. I went from giving this microwave one star to three stars now that it's working again. If it continues to work, I will come back again to increase the stars. But the machine has to prove itself to longevity first."
3,"Should have shopped more carefully! There are less expensive, more powerful microwaves available. My old microwave was much faster at defrosting and re-heating."
1,"Used like 4-5 times now all it does is pretend it's working. It turns on spins around and foods not cooking.Also bought this thinking it would replace my air fryer but nope it takes longer to air fry in this by far, it's like cooking same amount time in oven . Waste of money if you expecting times to be like stand alone air fryer, example frozen fries take like 25-30 min easy..... normal Air fryer like 15"
3,"First, it *looks* great. In fact, I would imagine its appearance is very likely it's best attribute.It's lacking a ""push to open"" button.It seems to heat/cook evenly, though not very quietly.It has sufficient power and a built-in rotating tray.Despite having a striking color scheme and low cost, I can't help but think that there's probably a better unit available for the same price.I can't, in good conscience, recommend this for purchase, no matter how cool it looks."
2,I purchased this microwave 10 months ago.  Light use by one person--it stopped cooking yesterday.  Not what i consider acceptable.
2,"The control panel is made of an extremely soft, low quality plastic. A fingernail is sufficient scratch it.It's the same type of plastic you'd usually find as a protective layer on top of harder plastics, meant to be peeled off after shipping. Except this isn't meant to be peeled off, it's clearly the actual finished surface of the panel (it's the only thing covering the LCD display). Mine arrived damaged, scratched, and badly peeling over the buttons. This is not a shipping issue, it clearly occured during manufacturing.Oh and the app used for Alexa integration is complete garbage.So now I get to deal with a bulky return. I'll give this one more shot to see if it was a one-off defect, but if that doesn't work out I'm done."
4,"Works great with Alexa, fits a small space…That’s the way, uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it."
4,"probably not the best microwave ever, but it's also the 2nd lowest priced one I looked at so let's look at value people.  the quality of the unit is good and it heats things pretty well.  it's not as powerful as my kitchen micro, but it is close.  perfect utility for the price"
4,"you get what you pay for.  its basic but does the job.  and, as with any microwave ever, the tray bangs around in there"
2,Hardly fit a cup of coffee. It’s being sent back tomorrow
2,This microwave is not to good. Takes a long time to heat up compared to any other I have had in the past.
1,Just like everyone else my microwave started sparking in that burned same spot. First I thought the Rubbermaid dish I was using had some type of metal in it even though I used it all the time in the past. When I seen the sparks were coming from that burned spot I cut the cord and threw it in the trash bin. Now I’m in search for a replacement with the same specs but I don’t know which one to choose yet.
2,"I've had this microwave for two years and it only functioned properly during the first few months. Within the first six months, it stopped being able to connect to and operate with Alexa. It almost never will allow me to add time during cooking or stop during cooking--I have to open the door to get it to stop. And today, at the two year mark of owning it, the light inside has started blinking wildly. This microwave has just had normal use these last two years. I'm giving it two stars for being able to cook things, but the user experience has been increasingly disappointing."
1,broke itself during a brownout.expect a lot of brownouts or blackout because fake climate change is real!
4,Espera que sea max grande pero que max da
5,"My old microwave finally gave up the ghost after around 13-14 years of pretty decent service. I mostly warm up meals and made-for-microwave entrees, and of course the obligatory batch of popcorn from time to time. Saw this pop up and it had pretty good reviews. Plus, I've owned Farberware products going back decades. I still have a Farberware Percolator coffee-maker that's probably pushing 40 now, and a small countertop convection oven that I've been using almost daily for 16+ years. So I'm pretty cool with the brand.It has a much smaller footprint than the old microwave, but curiously has pretty close to the same sized heating chamber for capacity. This is rated for 1000w, and it definitely warms/cooks things much faster than the old unit. I can cook a full bowl of popcorn in 3 minutes in this one, whereas it took 4:30 in the former microwave. The front panel is sleek and simple, and for most things it'll do just fine. If you want to warm something for 5 minutes, you just push the 5 button on the pad and walk away. It takes care of the rest. However, I think it's unusually fiddly when you want to input a very specific cook time, like 3m20s. Yes, you can do it. But you have to go through this whole process of setting the power level first, then inputting the total cook time. It's just a bit of extra keypresses when you need a very particular cook duration.It also seems a bit noisier to my ears than the old unit. Not necessarily standing under a jet engine noisy, but it's definitely noticeable. I got used to it within the first few days, and it's not that big a deal since I live alone, but if you're given to late night kitchen raids and want to avoid waking the wife and kids, this one is going to thump and hum a bit.For under $100, I have no complaints. If it holds up as long as my other Farberware items, I should be set for the rest of my days. And if not, this didn't break the bank, so it's all good. For the cost and the efficiency I gave it 5 stars, with the caveats about the time input and noise. If you can put up with those, it's a great value."
2,"Works okay but arrived with a large dent in the side.  I will keep it anyway, I guess.  I just got abdominal surgery and can not lift it to return it."
2,Pressing the door-open button fails to open the door and requires repeated/hard pressing.
2,"A bit over a year into owning this (with no other issues) the light started to flicker like a disco when it was in use. It would glow steady, then not at all, then flicker with every use. Customer service (after countless emails and numerous phonecalls where you're on hold for 20+ minutes at a time) I found out these are not made to be able to replace the bulb. Really? After barely a year? Great. You don't realize how often you need that bulb until you don't have it. Never in my 40+ years of using many different microwaves has the light gone out in one. Hard pass on this one or any Farberware microwave."
3,Doesn't seem to work as well as it should.
4,"The microwave looks good, performs like any normal microwave, and fits in the space I have available. The ability to integrate with Alexa was a bonus until I spent four hours trying to get it to connect to the app. I was about ready to pack it back in the box and send it back to Amazon when for some inexplicable reason. on the last chance I gave it, it finally connected. Do not expect the app to work flawlessly the first time expect quite a bit of frustration as it has to be manually added, the correct microwave model doesn’t even show up in the app, And the manual Wi-Fi on the microwave times out just before the connection completes 19 times out of 20 which is probably a conservative estimate of how many times I tried. As far as a regular microwave goes it is easy to use like most, has several presets and it looks attractive."
5,As a blind person using this device really works well especially if you have Alexa. Good job.
1,"Super noisy and lasted less than 3 years before there was some kind of meltdown inside of it and had to unplug it from the wall before it caught my house on fire. Generally I only use it to warm a cup of coffee or possibly heat some pizza rolls it, really never gets worked and now it's fried."
5,I got this to use in a she shed/guest room and it works great. The size is right and I am hopeful the turntable part stays where it is supposed to stay. Some machines get off balance after use and it’s so annoying to listen to the clunking sound as the glass turns. Crossing my fingers that this microwave won’t do that.
1,Updateafter 2 months using it now is so loud and sounds broken insideDO NOT BUYquality constructioneasy to useeasy to cleaneven heatingi would recommend
1,"I purchased this microwave end of April 2023 and got 2.5 months of use before it decided it was done. No issues with the microwave or air fryer function until today, when I tried warming chicken using the air fryer function and the machine started to smoke 1.5 minutes in. I quickly turned it off and unplugged it. The food was not burned, but the microwave smelled of smoke. Had I stepped to the bathroom, it would have been a major fire hazard.I don't understand the short life. We typically use the microwave twice a day for about 2 minutes each. I've used the air fryer feature a few times as directed with no issues until today. The last GE microwave lasted 2-3 years and this one only 1.5 months. Generally not impressed or amused by this potential fire hazard."
3,The dimensions aren't even close to correct in the description. This microwave is at least one whole inch smaller in every direction.
1,Bought Toshiba as they are known for their high reliability products especially laptops. Unfortunately the microwave has not lived up to that reputation. Thoroughly dissapointed with this product. It worked fine for about 18 months and now all of a suddenly refuses to heat. It's past the warrantly and I literally have to trash this. Trying to repair it might cost more than getting a new one. Will not be buying Toshiba microwave ever again :(
4,Works fine. Very very quiet. Takes about 10% more time to heat things than the suggested cooking times listed on food package instructions.
2,"Seems like a small annoyance, but it's believe me not: all the great Panasonics we've had previously alerted us the moment cooking was over. This one does not. At all. No beeps. No visual message scrolling until we notice it. No nothing. It cooks as well as others, but this huge, cheapening flaw would force us to never buy another Panasonic."
4,working perfectley
4,"Works like a Microwave should, however it doesn't seem as powerful as our old microwave.  Things take a bit longer to cook in this one that our prior one.  However it's big enough to hold pretty much any bowl we throw into it and it's actually very quiet."
5,Perfect and easy to use
1,Almost as good as an easy bake oven but not quite.
2,Lasted just over 3 years. Started sparking/flashing/making a loud noise on the inside! Now there is a burnt area by small panel inside. Time for a new microwave before this one catches on fire!
4,"I have been thinking about getting an air fryer, but didn’t have any extra space to include one in my kitchen. Then I found this device, and it fulfills so many needs.  On the day that I first received this product, I made french fries, chicken thighs, and brussels sprouts using the air fryer. I also used the microwave function to cook some frozen vegetables. I am happy to say that all worked well.  One complaint I have is that there was no included manual. However, you can go online and find a PDF version of their manual.  My other complaint is that the touchscreen buttons are not backlit. While that is a small inconvenience because I can certainly turn on the light to see what I’m doing, it would have been nice to include this small, but helpful feature! Otherwise, this product does what I expected it to. It’s replace my old microwave, and allowed me to have the ability to have an air fryer, without having to add an extra item to my kitchen that I could not fit.  A good little product with need for some improvement but a good price point for a product that does so many things."
2,"The Box it came in started falling apart on the Amazon driver. I took it 30 feet in my apartment, and it really started to break apart. I put my old one in the box and another 30 feet and I had to hold it from the bottom of the box, just to bring it downstairs (2 floors). It fell apart that bad.  SO I hope the microwave is better quality then the box it came in."
3,Buyer beware microwave is going out already!
4,The screen is hard to see and certain choices like the 30 second option which is used often does not stand out on the screen so you have to search for it.
3,"Bought this to replace my 15-year old, larger Sharp 1200-watt microwave. Sad to let it go, but it was rusting badly inside after all these years. Here are the pros and cons of this smaller Farberware microwave:The Pros: 1.) 900 watts of power is surprisingly sufficient. Getting used to the decreased wattage from 1200 to 900 has not been a big deal. 2.) I prefer the dark gray interior of this microwave. It is also easy to clean. 3.) A big positive of this microwave is that it is relatively QUIET (important to me.)The Cons: 1.) Not as many bells and whistles as my old Sharp. Lack of auto-reheat button options on this one. But really not a huge deal to me. I've gotten used to working with the button options it has and I've transitioned fine. 2.) Be aware of this microwave's compact size (both a positive and a negative.) It is fine for reheating regular size plates, bowls, and square casserole dishes, but it is too small to accommodate a rectangular glass dish. 3.) The keypads buttons on the Farberware oven are not as touch sensitive as I'd expect. You need to press a little harder on these buttons to make them work. I'm used to it now but in the beginning, I admit I was mildly annoyed.Overall, I'd say the positives outweigh the negatives relative to its bargain price. This microwave will suit your purpose decently, as long as you are just using your microwave for everyday smaller jobs."
3,Great little microwave.  Perfect size for our family as we don't use a microwave a lot but need one for popcorn and reheating leftovers.  This is just right.  Big enough to hold a bag of microwave popcorn!  Only thing that has been annoying about it for us is that it slides around a lot.  We are planning on putting some better gripping rubber feet on it but for now when you open it you have to push the open button so hard it slides around a little.  Other than that very happy so far!UPDATE: We have now had this microwave for 3 months and it has started making a horrible noise from the turntable.  It is like the plate is to heavy and the turntable has a hard time turning.  We are going to see if the warranty will cover a fix/replacement because the noise is very loud and awful.  Downgraded my review to 3 stars.
5,Very Simple to use Heats up great. I replaced a 1100 Watt unit with this(less Amps to Kick Breaker). the 700 watt is enough just set time for a little longer than higher watt units. Love this Farberware Countertop Microwave. Update still great My Comparison to the 1100 Watt(cooking for 2 min High Both) 1100 x 2 = 2200 watts used so to get the same used watts 3X700+ 2100 Watts. this seam to give a more even temp across the food Product . I know the math is simple but I never thought about it. so maybe it worth saying is all. loving the microwave Highly recommended.
1,It lasted about 2 years and then started getting condensation on the inside while heating my food. That is very unsanitary bc any particles of previous food will go into your new food. No matter how clean you are. So I paid around eighty dollars for this to last 2 years.
1,This is what ups did in my driveway.And then Tell's me if anything is broken call the office with in 24 hours. WTF this makes me mad.
5,i had an amana radar range for 40 years built in.  It broke down and could not replace.  The only comparable microwave i could find in size was the panasonic.  i like being able to fit large plates and bowls in it.  it cooks faster than my amana i think.  i’m hoping to build it in where my amana was
5,"I'm writing this 2 months after purchase.  This is a good looking microwave and works great.  Easy to read outside panel.  Nothing fancy to ""set"" and easy straight forward times when cooking."
3,Did not think the inside would be so small. Basically room for popcorn bag or a bowl of soup
5,I love the size and style. Works very well. The gray interior is also a plus.
3,Noisy. Its says its not a noisy microwave but it is.
2,"I’m very disappointed with this purchase. I bought it new in May 2020 and started having problems with it November 2020. When we use it, it no longer turn, it barely heats the food. I’m extremely upset that I didn’t even have it for a year. I don’t really recommend at all, unless you have better luck than I did."
2,"This does microwave, air fry, and convection bake, but doesn't do a very good job of any of the tasks. I wish I had just bought a microwave. The control panel is not very intuitive and therefore awkward to use."
2,THERE IS NO WAY THIS THING IS 1250 WATTS. MY OLD SEARS KENMORE 1100 WATT THAT LASTED EASILY OVER 25 YEARS COOKED MUCH FASTER THAN THIS ONE. MY GUESS IS IT'S 1000 WATTS AT BEST. THE INVERTED TECHNOLGY IS A GIMMIC TOO. YOU STILL HAVE COLD SPOTS IF YOU DON'T STIR YOUR FOOD.
1,It doesn’t heat well the tray never stays on right. It looks like it overheated in side as it had dark marks it has chipped all within 2 years. Do not buy. I usually do not leave reviews but this one was so awful I had to warn people.
2,"Bought this oven to replace a smaller one that worked fine but was too small for some of our larger bowls.It seemed to work okay at first, but after the return window closed, it began operating erratically.  The turntable stops and starts by itself and defrosting only seems to occur on one side of the food and takes 2x as long  as it should!  Oh well, this is how experimenters like me get microwave oven transformers to play with.Got tired of this behavior and bought a Toshiba for same price which works way better."
1,"I bought this microwave in early August and it's been great until a couple of days ago (mid-December 2020) when it just stopped working out of nowhere. The error code H98 showed up on the microwave, and when I referred to the manual, it said that the microwave was just broken. I then called customer support in order to get help to fix the microwave. The microwave is under warranty, so I thought I would get help right away. However, customer support did not offer to help or provide a shipping label to return the microwave for repair. Instead, they asked me to bring my microwave all the way to Queens, NY just to get a repair. I live almost 2 hours away from Queens, and this is unacceptable customer service. I don't know how they expected me to drive myself all the way to Queens with a big microwave to get it repaired. I am really unhappy with the lack of support I got, and the fact that this microwave malfunctioned after a mere 4 months. I would have let this slide if customer support was actually helpful, but they weren't. Please do not buy from them, as they will not honor their warranty respectfully and they will not provide you with the right support to get your microwave repaired if it breaks in 4 months like mine did."
5,"this item replaced our old worn out unit that we had for over 14 yrs. This new unit is larger, has great functions and extremely quiet. So far very pleased with this purchase."
1,Purchased the product in Dec because I wanted something easy to use and small for my mother.  It is September and the United it’s fire and brimstone when you turn it on.
4,The unit works very well. The one I have steams up the inside of the front door windows on Microwave it does disappear after a while when off.  So there might e a seal problem. It bakes well I use it for everything that needs an oven cooking. So I'm quiet happy with it.
5,Does the job and many options.
1,The product measurements provided were inaccurate.  Hopefully they have been corrected. We returned the product and decided to purchase a different model.
3,The door only opens 90 degrees making it so it's in the way of your arm when placing or removing food from the micro oven.
5,"The media could not be loaded.Easy to use; sleek, clean front"
3,Low powered but good price
1,Was working well for 2 months. Now sometimes the button don't work and a makes a beeping noise until you open and close the door a bunch.
2,Feel as though for the price it also came with a mega phone since it's so loud
3,Only lasted a little over a year of use. Better buy the extra warranty if you pick this one. Unfortunately we didn't.
2,The right size but takes forever to heat anything. Like 6 min for one bowl of pasta.
1,After 6 months the unit atari started arcing inside.  No metal in it and it is clean.
5,Very good
3,"I'm coming from a Panasonic that was 20 years old and probably higher end than this one. My old microwave was one touch to start. Hit 30 seconds and it starts. Not this new one. you have to hit 1 minute and then 'start'. Not a fan. The inside of this micro is gray and the light is incredibly small. FAIL. My old one was white inside and the light was much bigger/brighter. Much better. Thirdly, the door doesn't open as wide as the old one. Real annoying when taking a large bowl out of it. Seems like Panasonic has saved a few bucks but cheapened the product. Also seems like people have had problems with the inverter, hope it lasts."
3,I do not like the way you open the door. It is to black in order to read the functions.
2,I have owned the microwave for 10 months.  The light bulb went out on it and because the interior is coated with the dark enamelware finish it is difficult to monitor food while cooking.  There is no way to change the light bulb because the unit is sealed. The mic works but it is crummy to have no light. I called the manufacturer and they said that the light is covered in the one year warranty but that they are way behind processing warranty claims and it would be a 3-4 month wait to get a new microwave.  This is very disappointing news as to get it replaced I have to cut off the cord and send it to them leaving me without a mic for at least a quarter of a year.
1,"This microwave gave out after 9 months of minimal use (purchased in late July 2019, stopped working in early May). The microwave now only gives the dreaded “H98” error. Not only is this microwave garbage now, but Panasonic’s warranty is also garbage. They only cover the repair and where I live I would have to have it shipped to an authorized service center. Panasonic refuses to cover the shipping costs despite that amounting to half the cost of the microwave. Why the customer has to pay 150% of the original cost of the microwave for what was faulty quality control by Panasonic is beyond me."
1,"Did anyone else use this one & one day, it just stopped working for no reason? No warning?"
5,"Great microwave, air fryer, convection oven! Every aspect works well. We especially love the air fryer!"
2,Thought Black and Decker was good quality.  Guess not.
4,"Took 3 minutes to warm a cup of coffee that cooled off to quick, gets the job done just need a couple extra minutes"
5,Nice size and powerful. Easy to use and easy access.
4,"Have been using for a couple years now and it’s still going strong. It’s a good size for small office setting or dorm room. The inside is easy to clean, as long as you do so after you notice any spill or it will dry and get harder to remove later specially with anything with sugar."
3,"Product is great but the inside plastic film came bubbles near the screen for the time, didn’t wanna return it because I couldn’t wait"
4,I would have preferred white not black but great microwave and perfect for heating fast foods quickly
1,"I opened a case with Midea the manufacturer when my microwave started smoking and burning after less than a year. They keep telling me they'll send me a check once I respond to their email with photos and proof of purchase. They always say it'll come within 5-15 minutes and it never does. Checked my spam and everything. I had to keep calling back and go through the exact same process. After three times of never receiving the email, they told me to send my stuff to a phone number and I would get a call within one business day. Of course that never happened either. I feel like they're stalling because in three months, my warranty will end. I'm just gonna report them to Amazon at this point."
5,Good quality and great price
4,"Arrived on time as promised, in great condition and works well. Nice look and a great value for the price. Interior size is on the smaller end so you may want a larger unit if cooking larger items."
4,"This is a really nice looking microwave for a small counter space. Because of its size it isn't the most powerful, and I typically add a minute or so onto recommended cook times. But it's reliable and sleek and good for my studio!"
3,"I feel like it takes 2x as long to cook anything, but it fits in the small space I have and is nice looking."
5,"“Chefman” Countertop microwave oven:  This is a digital stainless steel microwave oven, 900 watts, comes with:- 6 preset pre-programmed settings- 10 power levels to offer better heating, better cooking- Memory function to save frequently used settings to quickly start your cooking- Cook quieter: silences beeps and alarms for quieter cooking- Eco mode to save energy, reduces energy use by shutting off the digital display when not in use- Quick start 30 seconds: the +30 button instantly starts heat for 30 seconds and may be pressed multiple times- Child safety lock, Interior light, LED digital display, Removable glass turnableMicrowaves are convenient to use, it has the ability to defrost and reheat food in a matter of minutes, and heat food quickly and evenly, healthier than other methods.This “Chefman” microwave oven has standard kind of buttons that most every microwave oven has, a simple screen, easy to use, the inside is bright, the light illuminates to see what you’re cooking.  It’s powerful for a 900 watts and heats evenly.  The noise level is about the same as other microwave oven I have used in the past.  It looks so nice on my kitchen countertop.  Love this microwave oven as it offers cooking power and tons of features, all in one compact, sleek design.  It does what it supposed to do, it gets the job done, it works great, for better heating, better cooking and more, all in one compact microwave oven."
2,"My last microwave that was the same size was 1100w yet somehow this overloaded the circuit and had to call in an electrician.  i don't know how that works but within a week of plugging in this microwave I started having issues. The only things on that circuit are the oven, fridge, & microwave This microwave does not heat evenly even though it rotates inside while heating. My oven takes about 5 minutes longer & heats stuff better! I often regret it when I try to save a few bucks & buy something cheap as somehow, it always ends up costing more."
5,900 watt black and decker is Much better than the 700watt Amazon microwave that broke.I think this one will last more than 3 yrs.
1,This microwave is terrible! I should have known when cooking at highest level food never makes popping sound I should have returned it fast. The programming is also the worst you can't permanently set a power level lets say you need to cook at level 8 you have to press it every time you cook. Just to silence the sound you need a masters degree. I'm not sure what the 1200 watts are doing but it's not using it to cook you've been warned.
4,Good
4,"Small space outside, yet seems large enough inside . One review said hard to open the door. I see what they are doing. Don't press in the middle of the 1x4"" handle, but to the left end of handle where the latch would be located. Opens easily. Great for stem bags or smaller dishes. Love mine as it is quiet and seems accurate."
1,"We bought one summer 2019 and the controls didn't work properly so they replaced it under warranty.  The controls never worked very well and then they didn't.  Bought another one because I really like the size and now the controls don't work same as the other two.  Switching to another brand, I have had it."
1,I bought this microwave in January of 2022.  It died February of 2023 and I hardly used it.  Of course it was out of warranty.  I would never by this brand again.
5,Very neat little microwave. Perfect for the limited space on our counter top
2,Quit working two weeks after I got it
3,"I read both the good reviews as well as the bad reviews before purchasing this microwave. I decided to take a chance and purchased. Some of the bad reviews stated issues with connecting with Alexa. I downloaded the app (MSmartlife), created an account and linked it with my Alexa skills. It connected the very first time with ease and zero issues. For over two weeks now, it has not lost connection with my router. What I like about using Alexa is that it has many commands available and you can pretty much make the microwave do anything by voice command. The second bad review had to do with the clock jumping to Eastern Standard time. My microwave done this from the very start after connecting to wifi. It continued to do so approximately every 12 hours (I assume this is when the app automatically updates the time). I tinkered with it for about two weeks with no luck. I verified my router as well as Alexa times were correct, which they were. Today I finally called customer support. Very short wait time. After a brief conversation, I was told that the app MSmartlife had an issue and would revert to Eastern Standard time. I was then told that their techs were working an the issue and would issue an update for the app to correct the issue. Customer support couldn't tell me a time frame for when this was going to happen. So I guess I will just update this review when they do. So stay tuned!!Other then that this microwave is very good build and quality for the price and everything is as advertised."
5,Works great and very quiet. Nice size not too big.
2,The defrost setting doesn't work.  Cooks too hot.  The crisp function takes forever .  Skip.
5,So far I like everything about this microwave. Very easy to use. Unlike some reviews it is very quiet.
1,Less than 1.5 years shocks us when opening door after cooking
3,"Bought this to replace my old Panasonic of 24 years!  Yes, that long it lasted.  This is about half the size of my old one but we don't really use it for ""cooking"".  Mostly just warming up things or microwave dinners every once in a while.  This fit perfect under the baker's rack and I was able to create more counter space.  The features were so easy to use.  Noise level is way quieter than my old one! lol  Price....couldn't be beat!  Thanks Amazon!  I love this little oven and will see how it holds up.UPDATE:  Lowered to 3 starts.  I'm having the same issue as other customers who purchased this microwave.  LIGHT FLICKERING and no way to repair!!  Microwave still works but very disappointing can not repair light.  Emailed Toshiba customer service and waiting to see what they can do because the 1 year manufacture warranty expired already."
2,Pretty quiet for the cost. Cute. Bought it June 2023 and it started smoking ( literally) October 2023 after 3.5 months after purchase… gave it a 2 star for that reason.
3,It was a nice size and heated as it should for a small microwave.  But after only 8 months it started to not heat very well; heating a coffee mug took 2 min.  I would not re-purchase this item.
2,"This was a great microwave: nice settings, intuitive to use, compact size... Until it wasn't. We've had it a little over two years, but maybe 8 months ago the light started flickering. It got to the point where, if anyone in our family was prone to seizures, this light would undoubtedly have triggered at least one. But despite strobe effect, it seemed to be working fine, so we continued to use it as the flickering got worse and worse. And then, one fateful day, the microwave gave up the ghost. With a popping and buzzing sound, the light flashed one final time, the circuit breaker tripped, and that's all she wrote.  I know that appliances these days are designed to not last, but I still expect a microwave to last longer than two years. Call me old-fashioned, but I just can't stomach sending something this big to the landfill and buying a new one that often! Not to mention spending the money to replace it."
4,I like the microwave but it's very loud. Plus setting the time of day is a pain in the .....
1,I bought this in May 2017. Now Aug 29th 2019  it no longer works. The oven comes on by its self. Will not turn off. I just unplugged it. I should have bought the protection plan for $29.00
1,"It is supposed to be the best microwave??!! In my opinion, it is the worst. It does not warm up the food. Turntable works when it wants to. I do not have the original box. I can not return it. I am very unhappy. Stay away from this one."
1,This microwave blew up after 3 uses.  I would not recommend making this purchase to anyone.  :(  I only gave it 1 star because the system would not let me submit my review unless I clicked on a star.  It doesn't deserve a star.
5,"Wife loves it; note that this basic microwave design is only cosmetically different from many other 0.7 CF units of other badged manufacturers, but I thought this the best in a dramatic black (it may also come in a high-priced red, also).  It's not as powerful as the old GE 9.5 kW, though it saves energy most of the time.  Someone critiqued its five-chime end cycle even if you open the door; some disputed it does.  I'm here to confirm, yes, it does, but no big deal & no deal-breaker.  I especially like the automatic 30-second heat cycle for quick warmups by a just hitting the ""Start"" button once.My daughter told me they've the same unit at her dorm & the girls love it."
1,"We tried to microwave a bag of popcorn, the microwave got way to hot lit the popcorn on fire scorched the inside completely brown we have been using this for 3 days. Th first order never arrived and due to the danger I've had to request a refund."
4,"At the edge of affordable, and not as small as it thinks it is. The no-sound ability is wonderful. You can still hear the soft-tick when it's finished. So, that's lovely. Beware the shallow swinging door. For a microwave the door will stop short on you every time, and make you almost spill your stuff. One of the shortest door swings I've seen. The light inside is very intense, I covered some of it with painters tape to take the glare off. I flipped over the turn-table, because it rings out every time I set my coffee cup down. Even still, worth the few extra dollars for a established brand, with rep. Kudos!edit 2-3 months in, The unit heats and defrosts, and all that stuff it does, that I don't use. Works wonderfully! Excellent! Cannot tell you how many times I've seared myself over-zealously sip a shallow cup of coffee.  It really is good, the light is still kinda bright after a single layer of painters tape, and some white masking tape, but workable(and doesn't seem combustible). It really is a space beacon that light, it will illuminate the moon, if you so desire, just point it. Anyhoo, my gripe is the door and the overall 'bouncy' nature of the object itself. Opening and closing the door is as jarring as a 2ft speedbump at 80mph. The force and resulting reactions are enough to place a cup inverted directly on top of your skull. You could shatter your Radius & Uina. It may dislocate both collarbones. Anything inside will ride a 3hr-90mph roller-coaster ride on the river Styx. The resulting force bouncing the unit into extreme extra-planetary orbit. You will have to call an aerospace company to recover it. I broke off the feet, in hopes of stabilizing it, no go. meh.It will blast all over some Pasta Alfredo, if you set it for 1:30 min 1/2, it will almost be completely thawed it. It will cook it all. It will heat the last gulp of coffee to inferno heat levels in that same 30sec, be careful. More than once now, rip my mouth & tongue. Thing gets HOT! The softening bread trick, 6-8 sec's in to soften it, use 3-4, it will melt it like fallout.  The fluffy things get hot pretty quick, be ready to grab!The door takes a lot of force to open and close, excessive maybe. And the units locational shifting is problematic.But it cooks like a beast. 3 times a man it's size.Also be ready with a old file. All the corners where your hands touch. Even some of the plastic edges. Mainly just at top corner near handle. Where you touch it most. But, the burs will hack you apart. Took a few shots, over few days to get all the spots smoothed out. You wont find them all right away. as you grasp it over a few days, they will emerge. And find you. :)"
2,"UPDATE: I wrote the review below after having the microwave for a couple weeks. Now at a distance of a couple months from purchase, I'm pretty disappointed. The coating over the 1 & START buttons is starting to pucker and show little air bubbles under the surface. Granted I use the microwave probably a little more than average (I work from home) but even so, what looked fairly sleek now looks cheap and shabby in less than two months. I hate to think how it's going to look in one, two, three years.–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––I'm not a microwave connoisseur by any means; I really only use the most basic functions so I can't speak to any sort of advanced modes or capabilities. That said, the microwave looks reasonably sleek and blends nicely with the other brushed aluminum/black appliances in my kitchen. I wouldn't say it looks truly high end, especially the button panel plastic looks a little waxy and less-than-premium, but very nice. The one feature I do use, and love, is the silent mode, where it doesn't beep at all. Maybe this is common now, but I'd never had a microwave with it before, and as the early riser in my family I really, really appreciate it."
5,"Best purchase ever, does not disappoint!"
5,Our over the surface microwave went down for the second time so we ordered this to use until service could be completed.  The vendor delivered very promptly and the product is of good quality.  We will keep this counter product for future emergencies.
3,"I’m having trouble with it shutting down midway through the cook time. It seems that it shuts down totally when it starts overheating. I could not cook 2 potatoes at one time,"
1,This microwave broke within two years giving out the H98 code of death. I genuinely expect an expensive product (expensive for microwaves) to last longer than two years under normal use.
3,Makes a very loud vibrating noise when running
2,Lasted only 4 years with very light home use. It started arking but only when trying to soften butter or margarine. I would not purchase again.
2,"I have purchased a number of Panasonic products, TVs, sound bars and microwave ovens.  The previous Panasonic microwave oven lasted for over 5 years.  This one worked ok but is overly complex in it's operating system with a bunch of features I never use.  But the main issue is that it died, power supply failure, eight days after the one year warranty expired.  I will replace it with a different brand."
2,No popcorn button & no  lights for display panel. Have to use a flashlight. Even though product description says LED light
3,"Practical, small & will serve its purpose, but it looked like the box got dropped or was poorly handled and there was a rather large dent in one corner. But, it works for what I need."
1,"Just got this yesterday, used it a couple times. Now for no reason it is beeping at me. It seems that it is haunted and the ghost in the machine keep pushing the ""pizza"" reheat button. I don't know why RCA is selling haunted microwaves, but I'm not interested. Will be returning."
1,After 4 months the interior light went out.  Apparently no way to change it.  On line reviews tell the same but it got a good review on this site.The light being out is a bigger irritant than you might think.Also when the door is shut you can hear it throughout the house.Avoid at all cost unless you are vision handicapped and hearing impaired!!!!!
2,"Bought Farberware Microwave Oven 7-1-22, turntable stopped rotating last week!Previously bought a Mainstays Microwave oven 10-19-21, door would not close, last week of June 2022, so I ordered the Farberware Microwave Oven 7-1-22, so NOW I HAVE TO BUY A NEW ONE? They don't seem to want to last even a year!"
3,"when i received the box has a damage. what’s more disappointing is that when i opened the box, there was a huge dent on top!!!i ordered a 1.6cubic so, its big if you have a small space in your kitchen. condition wise, it’s working perfectly fine as of the moment. the plug has 3 prongs, so i recommend to use an adaptor if your socket has only 2 prongs.overall, the product is good. except for the dent, maybe because of the delivery but not sure."
1,"No instructions and totally non-intuitive, which absolutely won’t work for me. Usually it’s easy enough to figure out how to use appliances OR they come with instructions. Very disappointed"
3,"Fits perfectly in my under-counter cabinet. Easier to clean than its predecessor. Does an excellent job of microwaving food. HOWEVER, the touch panel needs serious improvement. It's not nearly as sensitive as my previous Panasonic. I have to really jab at the ""buttons"" to operate it. The controls are also dark and hard to read. It could be vastly improved by being backlit like the keys on my laptop. So while it's a great appliance, it's also a disappointment because of the substandard touch panel. My options are limited because my microwave must fit in a certain space. If I had more options, I would choose a different appliance.  It's a daily battle with that touch panel. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,"This smaller, budget 900W microwave replaced our 11-year-old 1300W Panasonic (after the door latch failed), and for the most part it's perfect. It's quieter, interferes with WiFi less, takes up less counter space, and having an actual handle on the door -- instead of a push button -- is ideal.Even the fact that it's ""less powerful"" than our old microwave turns out to be a plus, since now it's harder to overheat the more common smaller items. For reference: heating up my morning 18oz mug of coffee @ 1300W used to take 1:40, but now it takes 2:30 @ 900W (1300/900 = ~44% more cook time needed).My only two complaints about this microwave are minor, and have to do with the user interface. 1) When heating is done and it begins to beep, you can't simply press the STOP/Cancel button to mute the beeping (our old microwave did this). And 2) If you don't manually press the STOP/Cancel button to clear any cook time remaining, then the LED display will NEVER automatically revert back to the clock. Super annoying. It should timeout after 15 minutes or so (as our old Panasonic did). Wish these two bugs were fixed and I could ""firmware update"" the microwave, but that's probably not happening, so gotta live with it.Overall a great microwave, as long as it too lasts a decade+ like our previous one did."
5,"Great size, easy to unpack, easy to figure out how to use, and definitely does the job! Also really like the look- it’s feels like a much more expensive microwave than it is, in my opinion."
3,"It's quiet, that's a big plus.  But I hate that I can't use the cooking mode and the minute timer at the same time as I did on my LG. It's one or the other, period.  Plus even after you open the door, the timer keeps beeping for its requisite 5 times. I tried turning the sound off, but found myself not realizing the cooking cycle had stopped - inconvenient. Also, I have to be careful because the glass cooking platform comes off the track really easily - not good!  But as I said in the headline, for the price it's pretty good. Bottom line, it gets the job done.12 Jan 2019 - Just adding a P.S.  I would not buy this again. In addition to what I said in my first review above, I have found that, for no reason that I've been able to find, the steam stays inside the microwave and no matter what I do, I have to wipe it out before using it to heat a second item. It's not that the vents are covered or have insufficient space - they aren't and they do! I guess it just comes under ""you get what you pay for"".  Will start looking for a Panasonic or another brand that I know to be dependable."
5,Good size and works great 👍
3,Is has a dent on it
1,Bought May 2022. It's alright. Air fry was no big deal. Heated up too much. Used it only a handful of times. After a month it suddenly got very noisy. Never knew microwaves were noisy. Annoying long beep when door is opened to tell you that contents can be hot! Huh? Duh! September 2023. Heating up coffee and smell a strong burning smell. So strong we ran downstairs to see if it was the apt. below us. No. It was from this lovely GE Microwave. Unplugged it and cut the cord. Never will buy a GE appliance again. It only takes one time to burn down your house. Why chance it? Buy a quality made item. It'll cost you more now but less overall.
5,"I love this Chefman Countertop Microwave Oven!It provides a wide range of options with the ability to customize different settings to meet your needs. The user-friendly control panel comes with an LCD display and allows easy selection of the function you want. The Eco Mode helps to conserve energy, while the memory function memorizes your frequent settings. The child safety lock is an added bonus, keeping the curious kids safe from the hot interiors. It is also easy to clean with the shiny stainless steel surface.This microwave oven is a great addition to any kitchen!"
4,Display needs lighting hard to see
3,Everything worked great first two weeks.  Now lights are not working at all.  No troubleshooting in owners guide
5,I have been using the microwave for four months now. Works great so far. No complaints at all. Looks and functions great.Update: I've been using my microwave 2 years 2 months. This morning it's acting up.  The glass plate keeps rotating after the cooking cycle is over.
3,"I've had mine for four years to the month. About two months ago the internal LED light started flickering like the light show at an Ozzy Osbourne concert. Then it stopped working entirely. There's no easy or inexpensive fix for this. It's a LED light housed inside the microwave cabinet. The LED light housing costs $35 if you can find it and it's not easy to replace. Plus, it hardly makes sense to pay $35 for a new light unit for a $90 microwave. So there ya go. My food is warmed in a darkened microwave. Can't taste any difference. Cheers."
3,"Purchased this microwave in September, 2021.  The size was perfect for the space and fairly easy to use.  It has a little less power than what I was used to but adjusting cooking times isn’t a problem. My only problem is that the finish has chipped at the bottom of the opening.  It started to rust and sent rusty steam throughout the unit.  I have no clue as to why a chip occurred but the unit is now mostly useless.  I hope this was just a fluke with my microwave and not a problem for anyone else.  Just a heads up on the possibility."
1,FIRST IT HAD A ODOR  CONSENTING CLEANING FROM THIS ITEM NOW SPARKS CAME FROM IT I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THIS ITEM THE MONEY PUT BACK ON MY GIFT CARD OR A CHECK FOR THE AMOUNTTHANKING YOU IN ADAVANCE DORIE SHABAZZ
2,Purchased this in April has stopped working in September.
1,"With allll the technology out there, my older microwave is better. Luckily I didn’t throw it and can casually look for a new one.This one is noisier than my current older one.The button to open the door on this one has to be pressed kinda hard. And my biggest thing, is tht you can’t have a timer going and use the microwave at the same time!! Like I do/use allll the time with my current, yet older microwave that I've had for about 18 years."
5,Bought this for my sister when her microwave died. She loves it and says it works great.
2,"This microwave has good reviews, but this unit has been the worst microwave I have owned.  The control panel does not match up with the numbers/quick keys, is loud and vibrates, display board will not keep time and resets constantly, and has needed to be unplugged and restarted5-6 times within a year to get it to work correctly.  I would not recommend this unit and would not buy again."
1,"This microwave only lasted 3 years…barely...and the scary thing is, it started by briefly starting up when the door was open!! Yes OPEN!!From now on, I won’t buy Farberware unless it’s a pan"
1,First time I used it....the carousel exploded and glass flew everywhere. The carousel holder that spins around  broke. It smells like a microwave that caught on fire. Really stinks. Inside is all black from the damage. Is not able to be used. Not sure why this happened. Had a microwave throughout my life and never saw such a thing as this. Very disappointed. A manufacturer flaw???????
1,"We bought this recently because our old microwave died, and it is an enormous disappointment. After having it for just a couple of months, with only two people using it in a household with no children, the lower part of the button panel has become faulty. Everything past the 7 (including the start button) now only works once in a while, and you never know when that might be. It sits on a table, not being jostled, has never been dropped or anything that would cause a malfunction. Faulty product, I guess. It's ridiculous to need to replace a microwave only a couple of months after we just replaced one!"
1,This item is verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry small and for this price you will thought it will be an normal microwave size.... and it don't work as good after a month of used on top of the disappointed size. Didn't like the value of the item at all... All of my previous normal size microwaves were cheaper and better than this mess.
1,"I used this product for one month without issue. It was working fine and they only complaint I had was the handle felt uncomfortable, as it has sharp edges where the palm of your hand grasps the handle.But everything else was fine until... Day 31 I was heating a small plate of pasta and suddenly smelled melting plastic. It wasn't that kind of smell when you have a new appliance and they warn you that there could be a smell of plastic. Rather, it was a pretty serious melting plastic, like almost electrical fire, smell. Sure enough, I placed my hands on the top to feel where it was hottest, it was where the electrical cord enters into the microwave.I called Toshiba first and asked if there was a recall or if they had other people reporting this issue. They did say they had other people but there was no recall. She didn't say how many people (I should have asked).In troubleshooting with the support person, I plugged the microwave back in and agreed to test it again. And sure enough, after about 80 seconds, we got the smell again.Toshiba's customer service, though arduous, was okay since it's outside of Amazon's return policy by two days now. The process is that I show proof of purchase and ownership by email and then I'm stuck with disposing responsibly the microwave which, in our town comes with a fee.So I'm getting a return however I would be skeptical to buy this microwave again. It's probably just a fluke but the risk of an electrical fire outweighs the chance I would take to replace this item with the same microwave, despite the good reviews.I hope this has been helpful to others."
1,"TOTALLY DIED AFTER ONLY 4 MONTHS OF USE!!! I was so disappointed when I walked into my kitchen and found this microwave dead. I tried several outlets to make sure it wasn’t just an issue with the power supply, but it was dead. It wasn’t even in use just died out of the blue. I wish I would not have gone with this cheap microwave, would have been better off buying a nicer one from the start."
2,It holds alot of perspiration when you warm something up longer that 1 minute. That is very concerning.
2,"This oven does not replace a conventional convection oven.  Not able to turn off turntable.  Food is supposed to rotate while in convection mode, but who has only round bakeware.  Small cookie sheet could not turn, so baked unevenly, burning.  Returned."
1,"This unit really had no good features that we liked, but it did work until this morning.It caught fire with noisy & bright arcs of electricity.We bought it in August 2021.Whatever you do, do not buy one of these microwave units, they are total junk."
4,"Overall, this microwave oven is liked by the whole family. It's easy to use, once you get the hang of it. It's easy to turn the clock back to zero and we don't understand what is causing this. A few points on how to use the controls could have been added to the technical booklet. We also like the way the defrosting process takes place. Defrosting is evenly distributed throughout the food without drying or overcooking the edges.  The surfaces are easier to clean than other microwave brands we've used in the past.However,  the carousel mechanism sure grumbles when turned on. In fact the carousel grumbles quite loudly and persistently, sometimes. Other times not. We all took our turn  adjusting the glass plate and the ring the plate revolves on,  but to no avail. Does anyone else get this same effect on this same purchased model? I sure hope that I get feedback on this. Or is this sound taking place only on our purchased unit?For awhile I imagined that there were two gerbils pushing the carousel round and round who were complaining about their fate being stuck inside the microwave oven."
5,"I purchased two microwaves and returned them before getting this one. I returned a $350 Whirlpool that was loud and moved all over the place when closing the door. I returned one to HomeDepot because it took 4 min. to warm up a cup of water and it moved around when closing the door. The Toshiba is quiet, heats quickly, has feet under it that secure it to the surface. Very happy with it and it was a good deal."
1,"Update: This microwaves internal paint flakes and chips off. The top interior of the microwaves paint has bubbled and flaked. The microwave started to turn on by itself and that's when I tossed itThe quality is incredibly poor! Do not buy! Dangerous!I bought this microwave On September 26, 2017 and today on October 25, 2017 the light  inside the microwave is not functioning, The quality does not match the price."
5,"This replaced my 8 year old microwave that rusted through the bottom- so it was time to replace for sure!The operation noise is minimal- was it even running? The noise alerting you it's done could be quieter. We previously had no handle, so I am finding myself pusuing on a part of this microwave that is solid a lot, oops!It's small and light so it easily moves on the counter. Not a big deal given that we like the little bit of room in front of the microwaveReally sharp exterior to match my other appliances. Arrived quickly , very happy!"
5,As described and fits into small nook in kitchen.  Fits regular-sized plate.  Easy to set up.
4,"I love everything about this oven. It makes eggs in a small bowl, fries bacon, reheats, defrosts, etc.  I have many cooking appliances and I wanted something reliable that was small enough to sit on my counter and had enough variety in what it does.  Does anyone try to fix dinner in a microwave anymore?  I sure do not!  This oven is terrific.  I just wish you could stop the beeping when you open the door-although you can turn it off completely if you wish."
1,"Looks like it was used, and didn't work!"
2,I got a new microwave because mine was old and it was starting to show on the inside. I thought a new microwave would have better warming capability as well however I'm very sad to say this did not. I have to warm something double the amount I did in my 7 year old microwave and that alone is disappointing. I've only had this a little over a month and the clean coat over the buttons is already lifted and the dish on the inside has a hard time staying on the track. Very disappointed
1,"a very poor item lasted less than 6 months and now the control panel has blown out impossible to use now, do not recommend this item to anyone, very poor life spam use for $185 it should last more than less than 6 months!"
2,"Bought this 2/2019 thought it was ok till now 10/2019. when set to 15 minutes at high at about 7 minutes light inside started flickering and outlet where it was plugged in became red hot had to shut it off for about 10 minutes then resume microwaving. This happened once before but thought nothing of it, stupid me should have returned it now its to late. Kind of noisey but no big deal, definetly wouldn't recommend a Farberware  microwave."
1,"[Edit 10/16/21] - came back to add that it took 6 weeks for panasonic to honor the warranty, come up with an RMA, and get the repaired microwave back to me. Thankfully the old one works fine. [End edit]It didn't even last 2 months before getting an h98 - magnetron/inverter error.Panasonic only has 1 service center within 300 miles; 212 miles away.  Shipping it there is on me.The extended Asurion warranty doesn't kick in until the manufacturers runs out but at least they did say they cover shipping.I'm getting tired of putting the old one back in. This is the 5th time and Wife finally liked this one."
4,"The product itself is great. Works very good and connected to phone with the app easily. Have not tried the app yet as we just got it. However, there was a small dent in back left on top and one of the legs were shorter than the other so had to put something under it for it to sit level. That is my only issue with it."
3,"Wife is 80 and I'm getting there quick.  The display is dim.The printing on buttons is ""designer"" (not high contrast making them harder to read)Replace a 6-year old Panasonic which was a tad more expensive, but the defrost cycle was faster on bigger things like a roasting chicken or a prime rib.(Anyone find a way to make the display brighter?>>)"
4,Works for eliminating other appliances.  Still not real sure what how to use at times.  Did go to GEappliances.com and requested a manual.  should receive it in a couple of weeks.  Not real sure what the short rack is for.
5,"After our 25 year old microwave decided it was done, we found this one in hopes of replacing the microwave and the toaster oven to free up counter space. While it is fairly large and wouldn't fit where I planned, it has a spot that works well. The air fryer works great with food crispy on the outside as it should be. The convection works well for cookies. I've used the bake option for my cinnamon toast and it worked great. The auto-bake worked well when I needed a meatloaf quickly (although I did have to add extra time to cook all the way through). The only thing I've found that doesn't seem to work is the sensor cook and sensor reheat or I just haven't figured it out yet. It had my cup of coffee boiling so if you use this feature--watch it. Or if you've used it successfully, please let me know. The ""instruction"" book does not give good instructions nor complete instructions on all features. Much of it is trial and error learning in addition to instructions already posted by reviewers."
2,Bought this brand new in December of 2018. It's dead in June of 2023. Started randomly popping and sparking inside without any metal inside it. Then started smoking and died. Terrible quality.
4,"SIZE is GREAT.  But the KEYBOARD requires  COPYING a page out of the USER MANUAL to place on top of the microwave - just to choose how to cook a food type. One must PUSH the COOK BUTTON 8 times !  just to cook potatoes.  For over 20 years, other microwaves have had an ON-KEYPAD BUTTON for each of many common foods."
3,"I replaced my dead S/S microwave with this one... it is not S/S as advertised, silver paint is not the same as S/S! Also, no ""instant on/ minute plus"" button. pretty lame."
4,Excellent small microwave for routine jobs.  No large capacity.  Only downside is it doesn't have much power so you may have to re-set a couple of times for the usual microwave popcorn. Fits on a countertop without taking up too much space.
5,Love it! The size is small and perfect for even our largest of plate to still fit!
4,"We've had this microwave about a month after our four-year-old GE quit working without warning. We liked our black GE with the exception that the control panel wasn't lighted and was hard to see. I bought the white version of the Panasonic so my elderly husband could see the controls better, although the panel also is not lighted. However, the GE control panel included pre-sets for common items such as reheat, poultry, beef, vegetables, potatoes, popcorn, defrost, etc., which the Panasonic doesn't have - you must consult a chart in the owner's manual and then set the control panel. Thus far I've used thePanasonic only for baking pot pies and reheating leftovers, but it seems to be working well. I hope it lasts more than four years."
4,It's not a bad little microwave everything seems to work like it's supposed to but I do notice it builds up a lot of moisture on just about everything I microwave.
1,The way to open the door was terrible it kept getting stuck and then it finally broke where the door would not open. We had to go buy another micro that day and we didn't feel like returning it. You need to fixed the push button that opens the door!!!!!!
1,Very disappointed with this purchase.  I would return it if I could.  The function buttons are nearly invisible.  I literally use a flashlight to see them.  The air fryer and convection oven features are marginal at best.
3,"I've been experiencing Problems with microwave, for no reason won't stay on (lit) but it's plugged into wall unit. I keep re-setting microwave. Not sure why it does this. I looked into information Today because it happened again. Say I had until June 24th to return. Bummer and an unsatisfied Customer #Toshiba you got to do better‼"
3,"I previously had a small Toshiba microwave, which started making noises after nearly two years. I bought this one, thinking it was a bit better than my old one, but it is harder to use, plus one feature in the description is not actually functioning - that of the turntable returning to the start position at the end of each cycle. I was looking forward to that feature, so was disappointed to find it was not included. Also, the keypad is very dark, making it hard to use, especially in low light.I guess I got what I paid for, but my old Toshiba was same size, a little cheaper, and BETTER!"
5,"Our office microwave died and I bought this to replace it. Works great, easy to clean, just the right size (small), but plenty of power. We all love it."
1,The only thing I dislike about the product is that it's making some kind of noise and everybody in the house is letting me know it's broken but I'm letting them know I just bought it
2,"I've had this flimsily-made microwave oven since last January.Within the last couple of months I observed that the light would randomly flicker, which was not a big deal for me. But today I found that the non-metallic off-white rectangle near the light grid appears to have suffered an electrical arc - a black, burned out area.UPDATE: 10/30/2019After quite a bit of ridiculous customer service processes (including RESUBMITTING a longer vid re: the flickering light, as if they didn't already know about a light-flickering problem - as in MANY other reviews - Toshiba (Midea), finally  sent a refund. Absolutely ridiculous customer ""service"". Now I need to purchase a boat because I already own an anchor.Apparently, there's more than just a light flickering activity going on, and that scares me, since microwave ovens are very high voltage.I've found two things: 1. There are many negative reviews about the same problems with this and another Toshiba microwave - I should have read the negative reviews before purchasing this unit.2. I checked out other microwave brands to see their reviews (especially the negative ones), and many of them have identical verbiage ""Dear friend..."" in their rubber-stamped corporate response, only the customer service number is different, which leads me to believe that several brands are manufactured by the same company - check it out.I called Toshiba, and they had me email to them an image of my Amazon invoice, an image of the electrical arc burn, and a video of the flickering light. I am awaiting further communication from them, and I'll update my review as things occur. I asked for a refund, since so many reviewers were unhappy with their replacement ovens."
5,"The media could not be loaded.Me gustó, bonito y compacto y sobre todo el color en las tiendas busqué pero solo habían negro y plateado y no me gustaron. Este me encantó."
5,I purchased it for the wattage.  My old one was broken but it was easier to operate than this new one. Perhaps over time this one will become easier after using it for a while & getting used to the difference.
2,"My dinner plates have to turned almost sideways to place and remove them from this microwave. There is also some smoke that comes out after using the timed cook, so my decision to keep it is wavering. I also have to place something heavy on top of it to keep it from sliding forward when opening the door! Guess I should get a bigger, heavier one. Get what you pay for, I guess......"
4,Working good but high price
4,"This is a very nice small microwave for the price.  Emphasis goes on small.  It is perfect for my one-person cooking, but if you want much in the way of capacity from your microwave, this is probably going to be too little.  Cooking time must be increased a bit, too.  But it's everything I needed.  It does seem to have a battery for when the power blips and will hold the clock settings for a short outage, which is handy."
4,"I ordered this for on a countertop in our basement.  The microwave arrived quickly, was packed securely and in undamaged condition.  The microwave is larger than I expected and fits larger plates and bowls easily.  It’s very easy to operate.  We’re not a family who uses a microwave for much more than reheating or making popcorn, and this works well for our purposes.I love the safety lock feature.  I can’t count the number of times my kids would start an empty microwave when they were little, and it’s nice to be able to prevent that."
2,The label of the touch panel is so difficult to read.  I need to turn on the light and have a magnifier ready on the top of it.
4,I ordered a double oven for my newly renovated kitchen last May.  Still hasn't arrived so I needed a microwave to tide me over.  It's small but it works fine.  No need to even read the manual.  Plan to give it to a food bank when the real one comes along.
5,"It looks very cute.It is compact that is it does not occupy a lot of space in the kitchen.It is effective that means it does the work well.It is very quiet when running that surprises me, compared to many previous ones I bought before.Finally the price  is quite acceptable.I highly recommend this model."
4,No complaints
1,"I would not purchase this Microwave for a built cabinet situation. When I remodeled my Kitchen about 8 years ago this is what the designer locked me into. I have had 2 of these units and multiple repair visits for each one. They just don't last. Please note - GE Appliances is now a Chinese Company and their repair service is now terrible. Thinking that calling a GE for a repair would be faster and more efficient  may be a mistake these days. In the past, usually one call to schedule, wait a few days, and the repairman would solve the problem.  NO LONGER!  My last repair scenario went like this: Call to schedule - wait a week for a visit, guy shows up, has to order parts, parts mailed from Indiana, next visit one week later, guy shows up and microwave fixed -  only worked for two days before failing again, call GE to schedule, guy shows up, has to order parts, schedules next appointment for a week later,wait for parts from UPS,  repairman shows up and fixes microwave again.Wondering for how long?  So, it took nearly 3 weeks to fix - in the past usually one visit from GE Appliances would suffice. They no longer carry enough parts in their vans to fix things. Instead they have to be ordered and shipped by UPS.Please note I described what was wrong with the microwave in my first call assuming that  would expedite the repair. I do not blame the Repairman - he seemed frazzled and overworked with low morale. He is quittting GE this week as is his immediate supervisor. Forewarned is forearmed. I am finished with GE Appliances."
4,no issues so far.
3,"Solid microwave for the price. Nice quick start buttons. Easy to clean and decent looking. Wish the buttons were more sensitive as I constantly have to hit start or cancel several times for it to respond.Now for the one big problem. Alexa integration is a f*ing joke. As you see from my pic it's literally on top of the microwave with access to AC1900 WiFi. When it DID work you'd give the command and it took a solid 10 seconds to wake up and start running. I liked it if I need a specific time to nuke but that wait is ridiculous if I'm trying to slightly warm a baby bottle for 10 seconds.Now it just says ""I'm having trouble reaching the microwave, please enable the skill in the Alexa app."" Check the app, it's enabled. It's never worked well and now doesn't work at all. Literally 100% useless ""feature"". Buy it cause it's a decent microwave, but if you expect integration this is literally the dumbest smart device I've ever seen in my life and I've programmed all kinds of custom voice activated lighting."
3,There is not sufficient ventilation for moisture to escape.  I'm tired of having to use several paper towels to wipe out down the entire interior every time I heat something moist.  It's unfortunate because I liked the small size a lot.
1,Never received it had to cancel they lost the package they got hung up in Lexington Kansas and somewhere in Mississippi waited almost two weeks never got it so I canceled the order the invisible microwave I hear it's really good wouldn't know
5,"Muy bueno , fue un regalo para mi hija , gracias"
4,I'm used to an 1100  MY new one by farberware is a1000. So it takes a little longer to cook. But it's attractive and easy to clean so I'm happy with it.
3,"A no frills unit, this microwave has no sensor (which I didn't realize when I bought it) and no fancy technology. It's a little tinny -- the door clanks when you close it -- and it's a tad noisy. But it cooks well, it cooks very evenly, and it's super easy to use. To cook for 2 minutes, press the 2 and the unit starts up -- no having to enter ""200"" and press start. It has two defrost functions -- time and weight -- and since there is no sensor, you just guess and the weight (4 oz or more). But it does a nice job of defrosting and manages to defrost without cooking the edges. It's not a superpowerful unit; for example, two strips of bacon take 3.5 minutes, and it won't destroy your ""microwave safe"" plates, which I've had other units do, including a fancy new Panasonic. It's a nice looking unit, although the stainless is only on the front, and it has quite a bit of room inside -- the interior is round. On the down side, the interior is a dark gray (!) so it's a little hard to see what's cooking.All around, it's an ok unit, easy to use, cooks evenly."
5,This microwave oven has many features that are very helpful and it is very well made it has a nice appearance  and works very well and is very good buy for the money I  would buy this oven again  I  think it is super oven!
5,I love this small multifunctional appliance.  I had it installed in my RV.  It's great!
1,Too small. Takes twice as long to cook anything.  Thought black and decker was quality.  Don’t buy this. I have to buy a larger one with more wattage now.  Trying to be frugal. Will end up buying another and throwing this out.
3,It lacks what the cheap unit it replaced had feature wise.The popcorn button defaults to some 1.75oz bag and does not remember the last size used.  It has fixed sizes so no 3.3 for a costco sized bag.  It lacks a poping sensor to get it right every time.  Upside it pops a bag in 2m.
2,"This microwave is VERY NOISEY when being used. Also has an interior light that is on when its being used, but darkened glass still makes it hard to view into the microwave while cooking. Its very heavy, but yet every time I pull open the door, I pull the microwave itself a little over the countertop and have to continually move it back into its spot. I have also noticed that it overcooks stuff compared to my old microwave. Also the 1 button is a preset 30 second cook time. And every time I use it to enter my own cook time like 1:00 minute, it seems to revert to the preset time of 30 seconds. The noise is the worst part for me. It has a very loud hum and rattle every time I use it and it can be heard 2 rooms over. I am disappointed with my purchase and wish I had purchased a better brand name microwave."
1,"I purchased this brand because of the ability to shut off the annoying beeping, but I have been unable to use it because of the chemical/plastic odor it omits, especially when running.  I have tried everything to get rid of it over a two month period to no avail."
2,"Interior light went out after 2 weeks and the unit is being returned.  I looked at the replacement procedure on YouTube and it's not easy, includes removing whole outer cover. The bulb is incandescent (???). Old technology and the filament is vulnerable to shock - like closing the microwave door. They really cut corners on the construction of this model. The bulb is held in by 2 metal tabs punched out of the interior wall - not even screws. Maybe all brands are cutting corners to provide the inexpensive models the American public wants."
4,"It fit perfectly in the space that our old microwave was in, except this is taller, and needs more space above because of the broiler coil.  It's amazing how the metal rack can go in there when it is microwaving and broiling at the same time.It came with a dent toward the rear on the top...however doesn't show in our environment so didn't say anything.It is a bit noisy which is the only reason I dinged my review by a star...would have rather given it 4.5 stars, however  don't believe that is an option."
5,"Great small Microwave. Very easy to operate, cooks evenly."
5,Owned a 1.6 cu. ft.  before.  This  2.2 cu.ft.Interior is white so much easier to see in order to clean.Great head space (height).
4,We like everything about it except the light isn’t very strong.
5,Perfect- well made- long lasting
1,Not Of good quality returned and waiting for a refund
1,Do not buy these piece of junk. Second Panasonic Microwave that has taken a dump on me. This one only made it 4 months before the cooling fan in the back would spin up fast for 3-4 seconds then slow way down and cause the magnetron to overheat. The last one I had lost the plate motor and kept burning out wave guides only to eventually shoot large arcs of electricity through the wave guide to the inside. Do not buy Panasonic. Read the horrible reviews here and accept that you could be next.
1,I know it’s only 700 watts but it is so weak! So much condensation builds up every time u use it. Smells! Worst microwave I’ve owned.
3,"UPDATE: 6/30/21This microwave is overheating, gets horribly hot on the exterior and smells like it has some internal damage starting.I'm putting this in the trash. Nobody should use this one.I won't be buying this as a replacement.It's very quiet. It cooks or heats pretty well. It didn't cost a lot.  It is rather small; careful vessel selection is necessary every time.The turn table and ring don't stay put during use.It's a very lightweight microwave that slides around if you push any button. Had to put a no slip pad under front feet."
5,"Amazing appliance. Microwave? All the time. Bake? Ohh yeah. Air fryer? It works. I am not a big airfryer person but it does work well. I enjoy baking in this more than I thought I would and I mean, thanksgiving is coming up. Need some more oven room? Not a problem. Being able to slide a plate into this thing to heat something up without having to tilt it to get in there is so nice. Well worth the price, bake some bread or even a whole chicken without having to bend over to pull this out of an oven and lifting it on to a counter is great."
2,Just received. Tested it on multiple flat surfaces and the unit wobbles on 3 touch points. Need a shim under one corner to make it sit correctly. Just ridiculous.
3,I am able to use the Black and Decker Microwave but the center turntable is too loose and comes off the track too much.
4,"Great looking, and gets food warm evenly, and quickly👍"
4,"This is a great microwave for people who don't have access to a full kitchen. The crisp function makes it great for anything that is better baked or broiled than microwaved.It isn't going to replace an oven or an air fryer but it does remove the rubbery edge from items like pizzas, chicken nuggets or nachos.Overall happy with the ""Chefman MicroCrisp Countertop Digital Microwave Oven, Unique ""Cook & Crisp"" Power Combo, 1.1 Cu Ft, Dual-Cook 1000W Microwave + 1500W Crisper, 6 Touch Presets, Digital Display, Stainless Steel Handle""."
4,for the buck.
1,The instruction that come with the microwave tell you what things are buy there is nothing to tell you how to to use them. A cook book would have been nice. For this they get one star.
1,Bought in Sept 2017.  Didn’t know a microwave could be that loud. It just quit working this morning....so I got about 8 months out of it. Says 1-year limited warranty so I’ll find out what that means. Most likely there are exclusions and I won’t get much out of it. Will never buy again even if they offer to replace....it quit working just gave me a reason to buy a better one from a local store so I can return it easier if I don’t like it. Buying appliances or large items on Amazon have failed me too many times and is a hassle to return.
4,"very good, but it takes time to figure out the instructions on how to use it. once you figure it out it works fine."
4,"Low power microwave, only 700w.  So you have to adjust must recommended cooking times.  Very dependable and space-saving."
4,"I have used microwaves since they were first available, and have had 2 in my kitchen for years.  I replaced one that was sporadically not working, and I DO like that this is much smaller, giving me more counterspace, but still accommodates a dinner plate.  It is very quiet and has the MUTE mode, which is the reason I bought it.  I don't need any more beeps and other noise going on in my life.  My only complaint is that 1. the controls are hard to read in low light.  A brighter coloration would be helpful.  2.  There is no stop/off/clear button.  If you want to stop cooking something, you just open the door, and the time clears itself after a period of time.  Sometimes I want to proceed with another item immediately, but would have to keep hitting ""add 30 seconds"" rather than clear it and add in the time I want.  Neither is a deal breaker and I would buy it again, but since I have been using microwaves since 1976 when they cost $450, I have my finger on the pulse of the microwave culture.  When I saw one at age 12 in a cooking class (1960's), I thought to myself ""I'm going to get me one of those...."""
1,Stopped working in 3 months
5,Attractive and functional appearance. Door opens and closes easily and firmly. The controls offer many cooking options and selection is straight-forward. The manual is perfect!
1,"I'm not a regular microwave user, but I should have known this thing was trash when it didn't even cook microwave-dinners correctly from the start.  The food would be either not cook thoroughly, or it would be overly-cooked. I had thought that the timer was probably off, but it's probably an internal problem. It might have been used when I got it. Now the damn thing just stopped working altogether after only a few months! First the light stopped working, and now the unit won't start. I suspect it would be cheaper to buy a new one vs. getting this unit repaired...but I'm tired of giving these people my money for their crappy stuff."
3,Works exactly as a microwave ought to. The only problem is the long and loud beeping when time runs out that does not stop when you open the door or hit cancel. There is also no way to lessen the volume or mute the signal.
1,"This microwave doesn't work.At first I thought I needed to study the directions better, but when I finally overcame the child lock(1) the turn table didn't turn,(2) the food didn't heat(3) the microwave smelled like burning copper wire.(4) The timer was fine though.Now this microwave is heavy and I tossed the packaging since it LOOKED so fine. No way at all can I return it.Even getting someone to haul it out to the trash will be tricky since it won't fit on my walker.RCA has a fine reputation. Amazon has a fine reputation.Now I'm uncomfortable about any microwave that would be shipped to me,"
5,Perfect for small apartment. Light enough to lift on top of the fridge and comes with a long enough cable to reach harder to reach outlets. Not as powerful as higher watt units but does the trick for the price
1,"Ran it for 1:30, smelled burning plastic.  Thought ok, is just whatever.  Opened the windows, and ran it for 1 minute.  Suddenly it just went completely off, no power.  I thought I threw a breaker.  Wasn't that, so inspecting the microwave, the top and side by the keypad were too hot to touch, this thing almost blew up on my counter.  Where in the world is quality control?  I'm hoping it got bumped in shipping or something?  Will try one more time from the reviews, frankly, but a little freaked out by this thing.Ok got replacement, no way could happen twice.  BOOM red hot top and burning plastic.  Second time shame on me.  Toshiba can hit the road, B E A T I T."
2,"I REALLY WISH I hadn’t purchased this over priced paperweight. The microwave works sort of, you have to do math in your head to add up the total seconds you want it to run. Cannot use it in twilight, the numbers blend in with the background. No manual, you have to find it online. I hate reading instructions online — while holding the iPad up to read in front of the appliance. I still haven’t figured out the air fryer yet. Not blaming the instructions, blame my inability to concentrate (chronic pain.) I HATE HATE HATE this thing."
5,Works great and cooks evenly. I like the size of it and the look. So far the button pad is holding up and it seems to be holding up..compared to my last one. The microwave itself seems very durable and I’m really hoping it will last.
1,Even at 100% power it takes twice as long to cook everything and is so small a dinner plate doesn't fit.
2,"Nice looking microwave, seems to work fine. The keypad is coming apart and bubbling after using for less than TWO WEEKS! Very disappointed for spending twice the money than others, thinking I was getting a better product. Trying to get help with warranty through Farberware is time consuming and a total hassle!"
3,Great little micro but not nearly as powerful as my old GE micro if the same size.  Nice look and easy to use.  I will keep it and just wait longer for things to heat/cook.
1,I had this microwave for just under three months and it started smoking with a very strong odor of burnt material. It was literally smoking when we were not even using it. This could have burned my house down.This is plain dangerous. Outside the 30 days to return so I am out of luck.
3,The media could not be loaded.Broken parts
1,"Bought this first week of November for new house, didn't move for a month. Here it is a month and half later and I am using it but hate it. It  doesn't have a push latch that opens with a slight touch, you have to physically pull the door. It is very stiff, therefore have to have 2 hands to open, one to hold it in place and one to pull the door latch. The microwave I had and left at the old house cost less and was user friendly as this one is NOT. If I hadn't had it almost 2 months and no packing, I would return it in a heartbeat. Not worth half what I paid."
1,This item was rarely used and when I went to use it not only did it not heat the food but got so hot it burned my hand and almost caught on fire. And Amazon refused to replace the item just because it didn’t happen within their return time frame so now they are charging me to return a defective item. Terrible service to treat a good customer for their item that injured a customer due to being defective and not burning up within their time frame. Their excuse our system doesn’t allow us to make an exception to policy even for injuries to our customers.
2,This product is a joke why is this issue not being solved with Alexa loosing connection showing it’s offline only worked for maybe a week bought for my mother that has ms and she enjoys making chocolates and other treats with this product now she is unable to use because the Alexa will not work period with the microwave
1,Returned it. Used it once to bake a small potato- an abnormal amount of steam came out and also condensed into control panel causing it not to work.
1,"Amazon was great! .....BUT...... This machine is no good. The first one I got buzzed so loudly when it turned on it was terrible. I even had the Amazon customer service on the phone and they were like, ""WOW, it IS loud!"" Together we read reviews, and this is a persistent issue with this machine.... Amazon sent me a replacement and it was loud too!!!.... Not a good product."
5,We ordered this for parents and they seem to  likes it. It is small and fits in the available space. Controls are easy to read and use which is important for seniors.
5,Very easy to use. Works great! Good quality.
3,"After reading the reviews and doing my research, I bought this microwave.  While it works fairly well, I was really surprised by how very loud it is.  Everyone in the area comments about the noise level.  Two other, more minor issues-- The dark, shiny door shows every single fingerprint and immediately looks grubby (I'm coaxing my kids to only touch the top of the door.) and the door swings fully open when not latched closed, exposing the 2 large door hooks that easily get caught on sleeves/clothing.  I usually like to leave the microwave door open for a few minutes to dry out remaining steam/moisture before closing.  The legs are not adjustable so I may try shimming the 2 front legs a tiny bit higher so the door will stay resting against the oven. Disappointed because I really thought I'd done my research, but maybe it's best to actually see a product in person in a store before buying it. Not sure I made a good choice."
3,did not even get to use this  It was so damaged when I got it I had to send it right back  ..very dissapointed
4,"Cute and efficient, this is exactly what I was looking for!  Be mindful of the small size."
3,Good microwave. Only problem is that the plate moves around and don't get the smallest one unless you are not looking to spend a little more and you desperately need a cheap microwave. Get the bigger one.
2,"I bought this less than a year ago and it had light use.  The clock and light work, but none of the buttons do.  It did work as expected for 11 months (two months no usage at all).  Good little microwave if you need something inexpensive."
4,The microwave is just what I needed & arrived here in great shape. Only problem is the bottom of the second # is out. No biggie it works great.
2,"Worked fine until it started smoking up the house on air fryer mode only 1 month in. Cleaned it out to make sure it wasn't grease. It still smokes and sounds like something electrical popping behind the right side panel. Will be returning, again. First one was received broken. First one was definitely a return that must have not been checked."
5,This is the best kitchen item I have purchased in a long time. It can be confusing when learning how to use it but it is well worth it.
4,The microwave is great but it came without instructions for the air fryer function. I had to research it online and found another review where the guy explained using the convection mode and the rack as an air fryer. I don’t feel like it cooks as fast as the dedicated air fryer with basket I had before so I don’t use it often.
5,This is a great size.  It is easy to use and it looks nice. I am very happy with this purchase.
5,Works and looks great!
1,"I don't like writing negative reviews but felt so strongly about this.his oneI bought this because of the 38,000 review. I should have the negative reviews more closely. I have never had a microwave that steams up so I can't see it. I cook oatmeal everyday and it bubbles up to the top of the bowl so I keep and eye on it. this didn't start right away but has got worse. I called Amazon who gave me a link and phone number for Toshiba, when I got a live person she told me this was normal. How can this be normal?"
1,"Bought this in Aug 2020. As of two days ago, (Dec 10, 2022) it has officially crapped out. Apparently the parts that heats up food has gone bad and cannot be replaced. Already have to buy a new microwave. Weak sauce!"
3,No calienta rapido
3,The microwave works but it’s loud and doesn’t make the food that hot on the first try.
4,I thought I was going to get 1 from my friend it did not work out so I reordered please send me another order for the microwave. Thanks
1,"Update: At First I liked this we have had it for 2 years now and we cant figure out why in the past 4 months suddenly every time you go to microwave something it gets all steamed up to where it is dripping water. For the price paid it should not do this after 2 years.! what started out as a 5 star review has turned into a 1 Star.After reading all the reviews I decided to give the Micro/Convection oven a whirl. After receiving this item, I got it all hooked up right away. I was at first stunned at how LARGE it is but I have the space for it.After reading all the reviews and questions and answers I decided to test the Convection feature first. I made homemade garlic knots.I baked them at 425 degrees(I wanted to test how hot this oven actually got) like I do in my regular oven and for my regular oven I only use  about 10-12 min so that's what I set the convection on. when the beeper went off and I checked and they were not fully done so I added 10 min more. after about 5 more minutes I checked them and they were actually done and perfect. so to my I am guestimating it takes maybe 5-10 min longer to cook then my regular oven. I also made brownies and my son baked Seitan. all came out perfect and again my kitchen was not hot. that was the whole reason I bought this. with 110 in the shade temps outside. baking was making my ACs work overtime to keep the kitchen somewhat cool. I tried the Microwave function today and it works great. much better then the microwave this one is replacing. during the week I will play more with the other functions. my prayer is that it does perfect microwave popcorn :)Update: I made a frozen pizza in the convection oven. the box said 400 degrees for 22-25 min. I did 425 for 35 min, perfect. so it does seem you have to go up in temp then what the box or recipe says and extend the time some about 5-10 min."
3,"The unit is loud when running.....I would return it,but I'm lazy."
1,"Terrible, underpowered microwave.  The keypad is the worst - you have to push keys down hard and sometimes they don’t work at all. Doesn’t fit a full plate even though that’s what the description says.  0 stars."
3,"Its easy tk use, its easy to ckean. It is super loud to use, got it for my small business in the back room, but people in the front of house can hear when it starts!!! I purchased because it got good reviews and said it was good for small spaces, but I guess they think of small spaces differently. The cubic foot in the title refers to the inside. In total its nearly 2ft long, 15inches wide, 14inches tall. Its bigger than the professional microwave I have installed above my oven at home. Will probably be returning since it needs its own fortified table and I dont have that kind of space."
3,this will trip your breaker. silly that i need a dedicated breaker for a small appliance.  not sure if it will work with new arc breakers.
4,I was disappointed that it arrived a day late. Cut 4 sides of box to get it out. Set up easy. Operation instructions very thorough but I will probably only use 2-3 of themI have only used it 3-4. times so far but i’m satisfied with results.
4,Maybe I’m just used to a 1100 W have to add a minute on to everything I cook.
4,"This is a solid microwave, but wattage is misleading.Rated at 900w - this thing pulls 1200-1300w between power level 5-10.Few other reviews confirm the same. Some people looking to buy these for RVs/traveling be ware of wattage.Other reviews mention how well this thing does for 900w - that's because it's not 900w. Even on the box its labeled as 1350w.Outside of this, it's a solid microwave for it's size and price."
1,"The internal dimensions listed are not truly accurate, they measure to the recessed bump-out inside the box, not the bottom of the overall internal size. Those measurements only work if you are using some sort of elevated plate with a tall foot. When using a simple FLAT PLATE, the internal dimensions are half an inch narrower than the bump out, which on a microwave this size, makes all the difference.VERY disappointed to receive this item having confirmed that my dinner plate will fit, only to realize the dimensions they provide are not fully accurate and I actually can't fit a dinner plate."
1,"It had a one year manufacturers warrantee. At 7 months it started arcing. Called GE who said they would give me a refund but only in the form of a voucher to use in purchasing another GE product. I was on my own to get refund from Asperion fir extended warranty I paid at purchase. Trying to get my money back on an obviously defective item took several people and much frustration.Then I call Amazon. They refunded everything including the extended warranty. Very impressive, but that’s Amazon - stellar customer service."
4,"Hoping that the Farberware name will stand the test of time. It was delivered promptly a few days ago.The red (front only!!! The sides are black) is fabulous….love the color.We re only a few days in….But, as others have said, it s rather noisy for the first few seconds. We re hoping it s not a defect.Finally, the 4-5 LOUD  beeps at the end of heating an item…..deal breaker for me :-(If the door is opened, during or after the process, it should not beep!We tried using the cancel button, to no avail. Even if it had stopped the beeping, we don t want to push extra buttons for a time-saving appliance. Defeats the purpose. Will update soon :-)"
4,"I ordered this one after my old tappen blew up, have not had a new microwave since 1994 so I did not know what to expect.  Like everyone else has stated this thing moves when you push the button to open the door.  It does not have enough weight in itself to counteract the amount of pressure you have to apply to pop the door open, I have it gapped between my wall and the back of the unit, so every time I went to open the door it got pushed back against the wall.  I fixed this by putting a piece of the styrofoam packing that was included in the box between it and the wall, it seems to have fixed the problem.  I think maybe some sticker little feet pads might have helped, but I didn't want to try and go to the stores during the Christmas rush to try and find something that would work.  It's a great size but the interior seems a little smaller than my old one even though the dimensions are almost identical.  This one is supposed to be 300W stronger than my old one but it does not seem to heat up food as well nor as fast, I thought that more watts meant more power?  It's fairly quiet and seems suitable for doing what I need it too as I am the only one in the house that uses it, my husband is old school and would rather heat things up using conventional means.  If you are actually going to be using this to cook meals this one might not work because the size of the interior, it only fits about a10"" pie plate and still turns, anything bigger might not be able to turn."
2,Unfortunately I suggest you don't get this one. When using the air fry mode it overheats. It sets of a tone and then shuts down the microwave for quite a while. We weren't using it for more than chicken nuggets and french fries for the most part.
4,"Works very well, easy to clean. The quick start buttons make it very simple."
1,"The microwave came in a damaged box, when it was opened it was dented on the side. We tried to see if it would work but it would turn on for a few seconds and then turn off and had a horrible smell and was smoking.  This is a very big box for the microwave and heavy and now I have to Rebox it and carry it to the U P S store. I tried to call customer service and could not get a live person.  I am very disappointed and am without a microwave."
1,Of course the microwave stopped working 3 days after the return window closed. I called Amazon customer support who routed me to Panasonic customer support. Panasonic customer support call took 30 minutes and I had to go through the troubleshooting steps I had already tried on the phone with them.They emailed me asking for pictures of the microwave and the order confirmation confirmation which I sent promptly while still on the phone with them. They would not commit to replacing the microwave even though it stopped heating just 40 days after I got it. It is clearly defective. I was getting the H97 error which is an issue with the inverter.Panasonic does not stand by their products. It’s 4 days since that call and I still haven’t heard if they are going to replace the microwave or not so I’m out $180.
3,Mostly to heat stuff.
3,"A couple of disclaimers to get out of the way: I paid full price for this product, no ""discount for a review"" here. We've had this microwave set up for all of five hours, so not much functionality testing done as of yet. I fancy myself a ""real amateur"" chef, so the microwave in our house doesn't do much actual cooking, just hot beverages, popcorn, and reheating leftovers.This is our third microwave in six years. Each one seems to last just beyond the warranty period, then fail (or in the case of the most recent, start making scary noises and fail to heat about half the time). This is a very disappointing trend, as the microwave we left behind in our last move (a built-in over the oven model) lasted 12 years and was still going strong when we moved out...PROS: It's more powerful than the Kenmore we replaced. It's bigger on the inside than the Kenmore we replaced (2.2 cu. ft. as opposed to 2 cu. ft.) without a huge increase in external dimensions.CONS: I don't like having to hit a button five times (!) to get half power cooking, something I do a lot when reheating (although this might change depending on the reheat sensor tech-y stuff). Every other microwave I've ever owned required two button presses (power + 5, or something similar). I'm surprised no other reviews mention this, it may have changed my mind about buying this model. This is the sort of thing that, in the long-term, I'll either just get used to or will become so annoying I want to return the microwave. The microwave doesn't sit level on my counter. I know the counter's not perfectly level, but none of the other microwaves we've placed there have ""rocked"" back an forth a half-inch like this one. I'm concerned that long-term, this will lead to warping, possibly problems with the door opening and closing properly (an issue with previous Panasonics, according to my research). I tried the old ""screw in the feet"" trick, just in case they are adjustable, but they don't seem to be. Beeping is very quiet in a large-ish house with loud kids running around.Other thoughts: Looking forward to trying out the ""inverter"" technology and hoping the sensor cooking actually works (which would ease my mind about the half-power cooking CON above). I've had microwaves with sensors before, and their sensor settings were worthless.I'll update with any major changes. I expect to either add a star (if I get used to the power settings) or possibly deduct one (if I don't). If someone can tell me how to level the feet without some gimmicky ""prop a stack of quarters under the back foot"" trick, I'll add another star.Original review posted: Oct 2016UPDATE 1 (2016/10/08): The power setting stuff is still irritating, but I can tell it's going to fade into a minor annoyance over time. Additional CON: It appears this microwave cannot cook and act as an independent timer at the same time. If anyone knows how to do this, please comment."
4,Looks nice and works pretty well. Does take a little longer to heat up food than some other microwaves
4,"This microwave works great. I have had no issues out of it since I bought it. I thought it would be a little bit bigger, but that is my fault for not looking at the size. All in all, it works really well and I am pleased wit the purchase. Plus, it looks nice in my kitchen and my daughter likes to look at her self in the door since it's a mirror type."
5,"Product is as described, packed well delivered on schedule, very happy"
5,Typical microwave.... nothing extra to add..
1,Came completely dented and banged up.
1,Key pad bubbled after two days. Front door came scuffed but I was willing to work with that but once the key pad bubbled that was it.
1,"I bought this to replace my current small microwave that would not fit my Dr. Brown bottle sterilizer.  Based on the published internal dimensions on the item description it should fit just fine with lots of spare room. “ Internal dimensions: 12.05” x 11.97” x 8.11” (W*D*H)  “. In fact the only way to fit the sterilizer is to remove the carosel plate and angle it in just right.  The actual door opening is only 11” wide x 6 7/8” high. If the carosel is installed it’s only about 6 1/4” high.  Depth is only 10 1/4”.  Note there is a bump back in the back and the side but still nowhere near the advertised interior dimensions.  This is very disappointing when you are buying it to fit specific items.  Please include accurate dimensions.  Tell people the real product interior dimensions  11” wide x 6 1/4” height x 10 1/4” depth!Update******Fire hazard-  now after less than two years it’s a fire hazard, it shorts, arch’s and smokes if you try to heat any frozen food in multiple known microwave safe containers.  Smoke and bright light emit from side panel as soon as you push start.  This item is a huge fire hazard!"
5,"This replaced a larger 15yo microwave.  We don't do so much microwaving now and did need some extra counter-space for our new air fryer.  So, we picked up this extremely popular model.Same day delivery is awesome!  But, this unit is even better.  First, it's quiet and lets you turn off the beeping (we're up at all hours at our house), now a very common feature.  Our prior unit was 1200w; this is 900w.  But, to be honest, we really don't notice the difference.The durability seems high, too.  I always read the low-ratings on any product (always prepare for the worst).  But, any of the issues mentioned seem to be outliers to the product's construction.  The door seems solid, fits well and it's weight doesn't cause the unit to move when closed.  (Yes, that happens with some other units -- been there.)Only downside is the digital interface is a bit wanky.  Just touch a number on the keypad and the unit whirs away cooking for X minutes, rounded.  Maybe I'm just too percise, but i like to enter the percise duration, not rounded to the minute.  You can do that, too.  But, it takes entering into another mode with a keypress.  But, other than that, we ARE happy with this unit.And you can't beat the price -- or same-day delivery."
4,It's small.  But fits on the bakers rack.  Holds a full plate of food without issues.  Only thing that gets stuck is a bag of popcorn.  But it pops fine.  Buttons easy to use.  Easy to open.  Easy to clean.
3,"So we got this to replace a 1000 watt unit and needed to downsize a little.  We liked the look, but that was about it.  The power is less but not that much. We have to almost double the time to heat things.  The ""heating zone"" seems to be more directed as it can burn up the center of the item in some cases like popcorn.  We never saw that problem with the other manufactured units.  We did have an original Toshiba unit (ALL METAL) from the late 70's that finally gave it up two years ago, over 40+ years!. So we kind of based our purchase on that history and company name . The glass rotor plate also for some reason poops off it's turnstile post and can make whatever is cooking spill.  Not very nice."
5,"This is the little microwave that could.  It fits my 10 3/4"" dinner plates, heats food fast and is tiny.  It's just like The Tardis on Dr. Who - bigger on the inside than the outside!  Perfect it you have an ""appliance garage""  like the ones interior designers specify (so your counter tops are clear and your home looks like no-one lives there).  IDK about reliability yet but at this price I'll buy a new one every year if I need to."
5,"If you figure out how to use the programmed sensor options, you’ll be happy with the performance. Popcorn sensor is spot on. Cooks evenly and a good price."
1,"Dead after 2 months. The start button don't fonction anymore. It really a mess. From my personal experience, I will not recommend this for anyone. I I wish I took into account the bad reviews at the time I purchased it."
1,"This microwave is a piece of junk.  Had it in our office with only 1 person using it and it has died already, we’ve only had it for 2 months.  It started making a loud noise about a month in and then stopped heating about a month after that.  Now it’s just sitting on the floor of the office taking up space.  Save your money."
5,"We use this microwave every day mainly to re-heat our coffee.  Still works great and is perfect for our center island shelf.  The only issue we had was that the clear covering was peeling on the buttons that we use the most but then we realized we never peeled the ""removable"" protective clear film that is placed over the key pad....Our fault.  Overall I would definitely recommend this microwave, we use it every day and it works just as good as the day we started using it."
5,"This microwave is beautiful and, omg, it works so well!  Thank you!"
2,"The Alexa function does not work.  After spending 2 days trying to get it to work, a family member started researching on the internet and found that the Alexa problem has been reported repeatedly.  So far no patch to fix.  Should have been disclosed with a low price or pulled from the market.  All other features work OK, but price is out of line for what you get without the Alexa feature.  Hoping they will focus on ""a  fix"" so it will work as advertised.  Really shook my faith in Amazon and Toshiba products."
5,Plenty of space works great
5,I love everything about this microwave. The color inside is wonderful no more white to look ugly. It is so quiet I sometimes have to check to make sure I hit start.
1,Please carefully read the one star reviews. This thing is a piece of crap. Every other microwave I've ever owned has lasted years. The only reason we ordered a new one was that the old microwave carousel mechanism stopped working after about 5-6 years of daily use. This POS only lasted less than three months & now when we start it up it sounds like rocks are being rubbed together and tumbled as the carousel revolves. Same exact problem as other reviewers. If we had purchased this at a brick & mortar it would be going straight back but since it was purchased through Amazon we have to deal with the lame warranty and what...send this thing back and be without a microwave for a few months? I will never purchase another Farberware product again and definitely will not be purchasing anything electronic from Amazon in the future.
1,"I would definitely not recommend this microwave,  used it the same day it arrived and it was terrible,  I don’t know if I got a faulty one or it was used.  But it would barely work.  At one point to didn’t work at all.  It turned soooo slowly and it barely hummed, sooo disappointed. I’m still in search of a good microwave."
5,Love it- I have a tiny kitchen it fits perfectly. Works great. Great price - all around good deal!!
3,"The product took a while to be delivered.  It has a nice appearance.  It’s a little small and will move on a countertop with very little effort, opening the door or even pushing a timer button."
1,It stops right at 10 seconds after 2 months of use.
5,My other microwave so so big it took up too much counterspace. I am so happy with this one. Theres actual counter space in front of it where there was barely any before. It works just great ni problem with heating and it’s easy to use.
4,I like the pad area with one push times-not to wild about the tin sounding door
2,Item too small
1,Key pad. Not all numbers work
4,It doesn’t heat my food all the way up.
3,Ok product but the glass plate will not stay put. When it turns inside it jumps all over and almost falls out everytime I open it. And too small to make microwave popcorn which sucks because my kids and I love popcorn.
5,This is a good machine. It has everything we asked for.
1,This microwave leaves condensation after you use it. If you don’t wipe it out after every use it will mold. I had to throw it out.
1,I received this product on 2 days ago 1st couple uses werr all very quite today reheating sounds like a train on a radio track....I am very disappointed
3,"Stopped heating. Most microwaves have a life of 7 to 10 yearsOn the positive I really like the timer that you can use when you are not using the microwave.  It is not as simple to operate as other microwaves I have used. Everytime you use it you must also put in an entry for power--i.e. what percentage of power you will use 100%, 50%, etc.  Most of the time one will use 100% and adjust the time.  This extra step is a bit unnecessary, IMHO.  Also it looks very basic--a big box with some trimming..  Not as beautiful as my 6-year old retro red that just died.  But loved the price as I bought it on Amazon prime day."
5,"love the inversion feature it cooks fast and defrosts fast. it cooks thoroughly without over cooking when using the auto cook features making reheating frozen and refrigerated foods a breeze. simple cooking instructions for many common foods rice, potatoes, popcorn, and one touch buttons make microwaving simple again.Large size even allows for defrosting a full sized turkey or ham. It is large enough to hold a large family sized casserole dish and still rotate. great for making dinner after work when you need to cook in no time and need to pre cook and keep the pre-planned homemade lasagna or macaroni cheese frozen ready to serve pop it in on the frozen reheat and in minutes you are sitting down to a perfect homemade dinner.  the inverted heating works I was skeptical but not anymore!"
3,"Cheap, wobbly -- doesn't heat evenly. Inside little square part is dark yellow burnt stain and will not come clean...."
3,"I bought this about six months ago.  It works well in terms of making food warm and seems to be above-average when it comes to power output.  However, it feels and looks cheap.  I bought it because it had a stainless steel look that would theoretically match the stainless appliances in my new apartment.  It doesn't match at all, really.  Additionally, it's not wearing well.  The ""1"" and ""Start"" buttons, which are the two that are used most often, are starting to crack and become permanently indented.  I'm not sure how long they'll continue to work.It's also loud.  The first time I turned it on, I was startled by how loud it is and stopped it immediately.I might use this microwave 10 times a week, tops.  Usually, it's far less.  I don't expect it to last a year.  If you need a unit that you're going to use very occasionally in a rec room or something, it's a good buy.  Otherwise, look elsewhere."
5,"Súper compacto, fácil de usar y muy buen tiempo de entrega"
5,"Our microwave had died and we were using an older less powerful one, so really needed a household one.  We live in an old house with old wiring, so I was a bit afraid of some of the reviews about flipping breakers, but we are not having a problem with that any more than with any appliance in our old house.  The door does close more easily than our old one, so we are having to retrain ourselves, but that is our issue, not the microwave.  The sensor based defrost is great.  We are not cooking the items we are trying to defrost anymore.  Very pleased so far.  We have had it several months now."
2,"You get what you pay for. Not enough power and the vent fans turn off and on randomly. Cooking on Thanksgiving was a pain. If you run the microwave, the fans start. If you start the microwave while the fans are running, it goes flaky. Never again. Spend your money elsewhere. I hate this thing."
2,"It's very light, so when you push the bar to open it the whole thing moves back. Also it is not airtight. Found a spider I inside, and another between the glass and the digital numbers."
5,Worked good  out of the box
3,HAD TO PUT A CARDBOARD UNDER THE FRONT TO KEEP THE DOOR FROM HITTING THE TABLE.
2,"Touch pad is not responsive/very hard and annoying to use for setting cook time , start/stop, cancel or any other function you might hope to quickly use.  If I had known this microwave was going to be so annoying to use I would not have purchased."
5,"I needed a new microwave and was on a tight budget. This works good and doesn't use a whole lot of power. Obviously being a low power microwave it takes longer to cook things, you just have to adjust your times. No complaints, pretty happy with it."
3,This microwave takes two minutes to do a one minute job
2,"Very disappointing product! We have had this microwave about 2 years now and it's already crackling, lighting up and burning on the inside!  This is a danger to have in your home and unreliable, in terms of longevity.Would NOT recommend!"
3,"Not that great of an air fryer or conventional oven. Microwaves okay, dont let the metals inside tho!"
5,"This oven is small, cute and has plenty of power to do some good cooking. The only thing that is hard to understand is how to cancel the timer if you have entered the wrong number of minutes and seconds. To do that, just push the spot on the key board that is in the lowest left hand corner of the key board twice.  Not once, twice. Other than that, this is a beautiful microwave with plenty of power. It is also easy to clean. I make popcorn in  just 1 minute and 52 seconds, vs. 2 minutes and 30 seconds with my old one."
3,"I have used this microwave for less than a month.  About a week and a half ago, it started making am clicking noise when in use.  I have not been able to identify what the cause of this ""clicking"" is.Everything works fine, but am wondering how long this oven will last, with this weir sound."
3,"I really thought I'd found a great microwave. Yet now this thing only works half the time, despite pushing the button it won't start, even though I've checked the power and connection, the door is closed firmly, the buttons are clean, everything checks out and should work. So we have to open and close the door several times before it'll work."
3,"Printed on the back cover of the Toshiba Instruction Manual:  #DetailsMatter.  The irony lies in what’s inside the manual - typos and numerous grammatical errors, plus repetitive generalized sentences which do not go into specific detail. As for the quality, only used the microwave a few times, but so far so good."
1,"Amazon technical support/customer service were extremely helpful in trying to help with this issue.  The microwave did not work upon set up.  And after calls to Toshiba and Amazon tech support and them having me try different things to get it to work it was decided the heating element was damaged. Amazon did not have any more of this model to be able to replace so  Keisha G, from Amazon tech support got Toshiba on the phone to see what  they could do for me.  They told me to submit a receipt and serial # and they would replace the unit.  Now ONE WEEK week later Toshiba said that they would be sending me a refund ck...that they don't send out replacements.  That is NOT what they told me on the phone.  I guess I will have to look for a new microwave and it WON""T be a TOSHIBA.  But I cannot say enough good things about Amazon's effort of trying to resolve this issue.  No problem with Amazon on this review."
4,"I like this microwave very much.  There is one feature, though, that I think is missing.  It beeps a few times when you are defrosting or heating food, but there is no reminder after that.  As a result, I left some food in there after defrosting and then couldn’t use it.  Our former microwave had that feature, and it was very helpful.  Other than that, the microwave has several nice features and is very stylish."
4,"Pros:*It works*Price: I paid $95*Quick Start: hitting start automatically adds 30 seconds to the timer, so you can warm up small snacks with 1 button.Cons:*Noise: It's probably the loudest microwave I've ever heard*Silent mode: It's not silent. In addition to its passive noise, the silent mode makes a beep when you turn it on or off, so you either keep it in silent all the time, or make 2 loud beeps when you want to warm up some snacks at night*Hard door close: You really have to push it shut, and it makes a good bang, which also detracts from the value of having a silent mode.Conclusion:It's nice, feels sturdy, but noisy and takes some time to adjust to its quirks."
2,very difficult  to read the buttons. My wife and I are seniors and it is extremely hard to tell which button to push
5,I love my new smaller version in the kitchen.
4,"easy to use,  jumbo size not so fit for small place, it's pretty loud when use it, but overall, it's okay"
5,It’s a great looking microwave. Just the right size. And it’s quiet and cooks beautifully.Happy with my purchase.
5,"I have had this microwave for 1 year and 3 weeks. It stopped heating food last night, and the troubleshooting video is a joke. Farberware used to be a good, long-lasting brand. I suppose that is no longer the case."
1,"I rarely write reviews, but wanted to alert potential buyers that this microwave caught on fire with normal use.  I have owned various microwaves in my life for over 20 years and have never had anything like this happen before.  We were making popcorn (something we have done in it a 100 times before) and all of a sudden: flames!  You can see the burn marks in the photo.  Maybe it was a fluke thing, but when I contacted Toshiba to help, there was nothing they were willing to do since this happened a few months beyond the warranty.  Again, maybe it was a fluke thing or maybe these microwaves are built to last for the warranty period, but not much beyond that.  It's not safe for us to continue using so needs to go to e-waste recycling.  Disappointed."
1,I read a review of someone who said the microwave made popping noises. Mine did the same thing. I thought it was nothing until the microwave would heat up anything. Well. I’m returning it and getting another brand. For GE I thought it would be great. Worst experience of my life. I must’ve got a damaged one but I won’t take a chance on another to replace it.
1,"When it worked it was amazing, however the unit died after only 3 years of service.  One day there was a short circuit somewhere inside the microwave panel and the display got fried.  Now the display doesn't work and so setting anything is a gamble.  It's really disappointing because it was a very versatile microwave with reliable performance up to now.  I read in reviews that these units don't last but I didn't expect it to happen so soon.  With the short circuit it was definitely the wrong kind of ""bang for your buck""."
5,"I am totally satisfied with this microwave!  I bought it August 20, 2022 and have used it 3times a day for meals and many reheating of liquids and leftovers. Food is consistently cooked through evenly  I am 88 years old and almost never use my stove."
2,This is very wobbling and isn’t sturdy at all. Food heats okay.
5,Works well does what I need it to.
2,"Worked for approximately a year and a half, and then just unceremoniously quit. Seventeen months is not an acceptable life span for a microwave."
2,A month after the return date expired the microwave stop working. Never brought a microwave before that didn’t later for years. Be aware if you buy this one.
5,"This is for the RCA 1.2 Cubic Foot Microwave, Stainless Steel that has the minute control buttons laid out in a single VERTICAL row.A bit larger than I planned to purchase, but well worth it for me.  This is the only microwave I've ever found (at least looking in this price range) with the control buttons laid out this way.  That makes a huge difference for people with long fingernails and/or limitations in their hands or fingers.For those experiencing any of these issues, you know how annoying it can be to use most electronic devices...trying to jab with your nails or punch with the knuckles.  Even if I were left-handed, it would still be easy to use my right thumb to directly press most all of the buttons because of the way they are arranged on the side.Also, having a handle on the door is so much better for many than the push and pop open type.  It is totally effortless (and painless).It works great, but I do wish it had the ""Add 30 Seconds"" button.  But I've used a lot of microwaves since the mid 70s and can certainly overlook something as minor as that.Purchased unit April 2017 and have had no issues or problems.(^.^)"
1,"Did not like the fact that some of the numbers on the touch pad differed in sensitivity from the moment we started using the microwave. The 5 in particular would bounce many times, getting more than 1 five.  Was willing to live with that because this is an inexpensive microwave. Noticed about the fifth week of operation, without having reduced the power level, the klystron would cycle on and off. We got to the seventh week and the klystron does not turn on at all. Microwave acts like its working, lights up, turn table turns. timer counts down, but it does not heat food. You can not hear the hum of the klystron emitting the microwaves."
4,Love the one touch time buttons that go up to five minutes and the easy +30 seconds button. Hard to see in low light though. It is quite a bit louder than my previous microwave especially when your first start it.
1,Broke in 2 weeks.
1,"Well, first unit ordered arrived today. Plugged it in and seemed to come alive, Pushed 6 second timer and 3 seconds into the timing seemed to be burning up and then just died - no power nothing. so  was dead on arrival- Did not work at all..... Can't say impressed so far now have to wait till a replacement arrives another week. Hopefully replacement will at least do something??? Hope I am not ordering junk? Have to wonder though. Anyway normally would not give this another chance but will try one more.. I'll update as I receive the replacement. For the 3 seconds it did work was LOUD! Much more than the panasonic micro wave it replaced.  But have to say was a nice medium unit nice interior color  as I only use it to heat things up.  I do not cook with a microwave. Well, see how the replacement does??? I'll update as I try it.So far can't say right off impressed! We'll see? More Later 9-14-23 / 9-18 Ended up sending back replacement boxed new unopened . Had purchased another brand Lowes  that worked great for aa few dollars more. Not  Faberware. Bad experience right off -DOA not impressive - pass on this get a Toshiba . Or even better if you can afford a Panasonic ."
1,"Seriously! Do not buy this! Thought ok, close to my old one type, hamilton beach and its farberware.Oh my, no! You know how there is something underneath the glass plate makes that sound, you remove and fix it. No, this is how it will ALWAYS sound from day one. If you like that growling sound then this is the one. So bad!"
5,I bought because it was necessary. It would be very difficult for me to live without one. I usually go without protection but I'm glad I picked up protection too. I can eat microwave dishes again. Thank you.
1,"My last Panasonic lasted about 15 or more years. I was quite sad to see it go. The only complaint that I have with this one is the numbers on the led are too close together, gotta squint to see sometimes.UPDATE:This microwave isn't the same as the last one that I had. This one started blanking out mid cycle. I have to unplug it for a period of time and it will work again for a while, then quit mid cycle and go blank. Nothing seems to work until it is unplugged and it resets..I called panasonic and their solution was to send me a box so that I could send it off to get repaired. I have refused. I bought a new Micro Wave that was supposed to work, that is what I expect. Twice I was supposed to get a call from a manager, not happening.I am seriously disappointed with Panasonic. It used to be a great product. Unfortunately that seems no longer to be the case. It was made in China, I later found out. It works intermittenly, so I will keep it until it either goes permanently belly up, throw it away and buy a product that works from a different company.  I was asked to comment by another buyer about the same problem. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.."
5,"This thing is bulletproof in my book! It has been bouncing around in my semi truck for 3 years now in the cabinet of a 2009 volvo vnl (tv cabinet with the face trim of cabinet removed, perfect size) and while I have to replace pretty much everything on a regular basis that bounces around in here, this thing is a champ and super powerful. I only add 20 seconds or so on and it's like my 1000w at home! Outstanding!!"
1,Panel is not lit up so it’s hard to see the numbers in dim light
3,"Convection oven is decent. Wouldn’t replace my traditional air fryer though, doesn’t stack up"
5,Se ve bien
5,"It is very small and not very powerful (which I knew when I purchased it), but I bought it for a home-built camper.  It isn't terribly efficient; typical rule of thumb for microwaves is that they use 50% more than their rated output.  This one draws around 1200W (the 50% rule of thumb would yield 1050W).  It runs off my Jackery Explorer 2000 Pro just fine though, even with a mini-fridge and other stuff running at the same time.  In standby, it registers as being practically no load (my Jackery registers it between 0 and 1W).The dish is about the size of a large plate, which is plenty adequate for most usage.  And as a bonus, when something explodes because you overestimated how much extra time it requires (typical microwave instructions are for 1100W models, not for 700W) the platter fits in my dishwasher pretty easily (though I don't have one of those in the camper...).I like the express cook buttons.  The only function button I tried is the beverage, which was a bad joke.  I put two cups of water in it, put it on beverage 2 and it came out about 120 degrees, which isn't really hot enough for anything.  I don't typically use those other functions that often though."
1,"While this microwave is quite powerful and spacious, it is also a disappointment in other ways. There is no ""quick cook feature"" (my oversight) as even the '30 second' button requires hitting 'start' after pressing it. The glass microwave popcorn bowl was rendered useless with this microwave as no matter how we adjusted settings, time, power level...the popcorn always burned. We have managed just fine with this microwave despite those disappointments but the microwave just up and died on us yesterday while we were cooking oatmeal. Purchased in June 2020 and useless in November 2020...very disappointed in this purchase. We will not be replacing our microwave with the same model or brand."
3,Microwave works fine. Within 2 months the plastic on the keypad has bubbled and ripped. Considering the cost of this microwave we expected the plastic to stay in place for munch longer. Really disappointed.
5,We purchased 2 of these for our factory breakroom. The microwave gets a lot of use and still looks great. These microwaves are used everyday by 30+ people and no one has had a problem with them. They clean up well and the buttons are easy to use. We have been using them for over 3 months - we no complaints
5,Great for small spaces
5,"I purchased this microwave when I downsized you an apartment and no longer had an over the stove microwave. I love everything about this microwave. When talking about just using it as a basic microwave without the features it’s great- when you utilize the features (talk to control, moisture sensor, etc it’s amazing. I’ve always had an over the stove but this one is actually better than those. Love it- buy it. You won’t regret it!! ☺️"
4,"First off I will be keeping this microwave despite several obvious flaws. The inverter technology is good, plus I’m replacing a sub standard microwave with this so anything is an improvement. It just seems these days no one beta tests prior to launch.Pros….Inverter technologyDoor latch is smooth and closes easily.Plenty of power, heats quickly and nice size at 1.2 cu. Ft.The buttons are a big bonus over a flat keypad.I thought at first the operating system would seem flawed. To change time or power you punch the same button several times. As opposed to hitting numerical buttons to enter time values. But now I like this system.Cons….The interior light is useless along with the dark interior.Opening the door requires right hand to press the button and left hand to open the door. A handle with a release button would have been one handed and so much easier.Noisy when running.Twenty buttons, half of which will never get used. Kind of a gimmick. Could have had six larger buttons that were easier to use."
1,"Upon receipt, the item was damaged.  When we tried to use it, a code appeared that was not repairable.  I requested a replacement.  When I received the replacement it was damaged more than the first one.  It appears these are refurbished.  Now I find out it takes 30 days to get a refund."
3,"Just received the Toshiba microwave air fryer and still trying to figure out some of its functions. As others have complained, the manual is of very little help. The air fryer instructions are totally absent, but it appears that it is just the convection mode (maybe a higher temp or fan speed?). When I press the air fryer button, convection is indicated on the panel. This is a disappointment for me because that is why I bought this particular model. Not having enough room for both a microwave and an air fryer, I thought this would be the answer...not so sure now. Must say this is a large microwave and that function works very well. I will give this a few more weeks of trial and update this review if needed."
2,"I wanted a small microwave unit for my counter. I chose Black & Decker because of the brand successes.This is small, but too small for even a bag of microwave popcorn! Also, the buttons are difficult to get to respond. It takes 3 or 4 tries to get what I am pressing entered. And NOISY! OMG! is it noisy! If I could return it, I would but I've had it longer than the return policy allows. The only reason I didn't consider returning it sooner is because I figured the buttons just needed breaking in and I could live with the other issues. But, seriously, the buttons and the noise are driving me crazy!"
4,"Works well for small spaces. Not very powerful, but it's good for it's size. Clock won't stay set, always runs fast. I like that you can turn the sound off. Perfect for college dorm"
3,"Purchased September 2020, and needed replacing within 2 years. Worked well with no complaints for a while, but now the inside of the door is rusted and the microwave turns on by itself at random if left plugged in."
1,"Very disappointing purchase. The convection feature on this microwave was the reason for buying it. I disregared the bad reviews about the feet/legs because I needed a combination microwave/convection oven. The badly designed feet are the least of the problem.For practical purposes, the convection feature is non-functioning. I have used it three times and each time it has failed. The first time was cornbread that did not rise even after baking it for double the amount of time. The second and third times the food came out luke warm and not fully cooked. This after following recipe instructions.Perhaps the problem is that the convection fan goes on and off, it does not operate continuously. On my two other convection ovens, the fan stayed on continuously to circulate the air inside the oven. In this Toshiba, it does not and the air does not get hot enough, even with the preheat cycle.My previous combination microwave/convection worked beautifully. The convection worked just like my full convection oven does. It baked and cooked everything perfectly just like my regular oven but it stopped working after several years of use.The microwave feature works fine and it is easy to use, clean, etc. However, if you want a convection feature that works equally well, do not buy this oven."
4,I think this will work out fine for me and for the price it's a good deal.
4,"We love this unit. We were debating getting an air fryer or other appliances when we found this. Although it doesn't work exactly like an air fryer, you can really do it all in this unit! The convection feature is great, the microwave works perfectly, and reheating leftovers are great since they aren't soggy. If you had.to pick one machine to cook with this should be it! Just make sure you have a few inches clearance all around, because the outside gets hot in convection or air fry modes."
5,The product works good it self.Dut I didn't like that price in the middle of the product. You have keep putting in back in place.🤔🤔🤗😳
3,"Very light weight, slides around on counter when you open door"
4,"A little underpowered at 700 watts so you will most likely need to add time to whatever you are heating up but it is very compact and still good value for the money spent. Only real complaint I have as far as the design is concerned is that you have to pull the door open by the handle, there is no button that you push that opens the door like most microwaves have."
4,Over all love this. Love that the end time beep doesn't continue until you open the door. Only downside is that the microwave itself is very loud.
4,"Thickness is not good as it has an echo when closing door.  The touch screen is flat, but need to push numbers hard to make register."
4,Matched my old one cubic and strength but burned my popcorn in my popper because interior not tall enough. This one is wider. Also do not like a handle to pull as it can slide off my stand and I can bump into it. The old had a door release push button. I am keeping and will reduce power for the popcorn. Also it creates more steam when cooking liquids.
3,"Received microwave/oven/fryer early in the morning and spent the day familiarizing myself with it by putting it through its paces. As advertised, it's solidly built and exceptionally quiet. It also microwaves, air-fries, and convection bakes very well.An in-depth manual didn't come with mine so I downloaded one from GE's website and printed it out. The manual is generic in nature. That is to say, it describes features, functions and how-to-do-its that may or may not pertain to this particular modelNow for the bad news. It is a potential fire hazard. Air frying mode requires you use the taller of two racks. That places anything you cook very close to the heating elements. Anything containing fat like beef, pork, chicken, bacon, etc. is going to pop and sizzle. That pop can easily spatter on the overhead air-fry heating elements. When it does the spatter bursts into flame for a second or two until it burns off. In my opinion this could easily escalate into a full blown kitchen fire if whatever being air-fried continued to spatter on the heating elements for several minutes.Also be aware this unit exhausts very hot air through a vent located near the bottom left side of the appliance when in convection oven or air-fry mode. I originally put the unit on top of my refrigerator but quickly moved it to a countertop when I touched the refrigerator surface near the exhaust vent. The top of the refrigerator was almost too hot to touch!I read a few customer reviews that claimed their oven caught fire in the upper compartment where the air-fry heating elements are located. I suspect they were air-frying fatty meat or something coated with oil that continually spattered on the overhead heating elements. That in turn resulted in the unit catching fire.Summing up, my recommendation is to only use the air-fry option with things like frozen French fries, thinly sliced vegetables, etc.. But cook all meats or anything coated with oil in Convection Oven mode with the shorter rack. Otherwise you definitely run the risk of the unit catching fire."
5,"i am thrilled with my new microwave oven, and what a great price for such a large one.  I was nervous about buying an appliance like this on Amazon because I was worried about it being damaged during delivery.  It arrived in perfect condition, though, and works perfectly.  I am fortunate to have a good-sized cabinet above my oven (see picture) and wanted to fully utilize the space with a large microwave.  Now, with an 16.5"" turntable, I don't have to ever worry about whether a casserole dish will fit and turn in my microwave...yay! My daugther helped me unpack and lift it into the cabinet. When I mentioned that I bought it on Amazon, she said ""Wait, you got this on Amazon?!!""  She had assumed I got it at one of our local big box stores.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase."
4,It worked wonerful the first year or so and now buttons are not working properly. But its no longer under warranty submission.
4,Easy to use once you practice a few times. Keypad very dim in unlighted room.
3,"It is so lightweight that when I open the door, it moves around. The first time I did, I almost knocked it off the counter. Otherwise, it has all the needed functions and seems to heat pretty evenly and quickly."
2,"Works fine as a microwave but I could have bought a microwave for $100. Not really useable as a convection oven or an air fryer, 35 minutes for bacon? Airfryer/convection instructions nonexistent, that probably should have been my first clue,"
5,"Overall, I’m very pleased with this microwave. I’ve had it a few weeks now and haven’t had any problems with it. It’s very good looking and blends in well with the rest of our stainless appliances. I thought that all of the quick shortcut buttons would be a con, but I find myself using them a lot. It is a little on the noisy side, but it doesn’t bother us that much (it’s quieter than our old one). It’s definitely a great value for the money. Other microwaves we looked at with the same features cost nearly $100 more and didn’t have as many good reviews."
2,"Like the oven and microwave but the air fryer lacks a lot. I mainly bought it for the air fryer, it is very limited on what it cooks and bottom side doesn't get fully cook while the top gets burnt. Again happy with the other operations. Don't buy this if you want to use the air fryer side more."
2,"This is not an air fryer. This might be fine as a microwave, but I wanted to combine everything into one. My cheap basket style air fryer could take this things lunch money. Returned immediately. Don't think this is anything resembling an air fryer. Even the manual doesn't once mention anything about the ""air fryer"""
5,"I don’t “cook” in my microwave. I melt butter and boil water for tea, maybe reheat the occasional leftover meal so I just need a little one. That said it heats a beverage very quickly & doesn't take up much space. It’s small but has a lot of power."
5,Nice
4,"Looks good, easy to use and came even earlier than promised. Would recommend"
4,"Had this for a month now. It replaced another Panasonic which lasted over 14 years. Function perfectly, but I found some design flaws that are very irritating.1) Having to tap button numerous time to set power levels as everyone mentioned. 2) Wavy keypad numbers. 3) Window is very dark or LED interior light is too small. You can barely see the food cooking inside unless the room is very dark."
3,The turntable wheel is cheaply made. Makes noises. I think the five beeps are too many. The door closes loudly.
5,"I had forgotten how handy it is to have a microwave that can handle my larger dishes, and the higher power availability is great.  It's simple to use - has a nice 30 second button (still need to hit start).The only automatic function I use much is the sensor reheat - which surprised me in that it works remarkably well.While no microwave is going to be perfect taking refrigerated items to perfect temp without stirring or adjustment, it seems to perform better than most."
1,I bought the unit cause it stated it was also a air fryer as well as the other things . But when I went to heat up frozen popcorn chicken it took 35 mins to cook . My other air fryer took less than 15mins . But also it doesn't come with a air fryer pan so the air can circulate around the food . It came with a roasting pan which makes it so you have to turn over the food after a few mins to cook all the way around . I'm very disappointed with the product . I will be returning the unit .
5,I need a small microwave for my office.  Works very well in the limited space I have.  My staff like it too.
2,"This microwave looks terrific.  The problem is touching the numbers.  It requires a lot of pressure and even then, sometimes it doesn't work.  I have to hold onto the sides of the microwave to avoid pushing it to the back of the counter.  Very frustrating to use, would never buy it again."
3,i would buy deferent or trade if i could
2,"The microwave is effective and the sensor great.  I'm comparing the air-fryer to my Nuwave Brio which I use one to three times almost every day and have just worn out.  The air-fryer accessories are wholly inadequate, and I cannot find any decent ones; Ideally, three full size mesh adjustable racks.  The rim on the glass plate is too low to hold grease; I regularly cook ten strips of bacon in the morning and some drippy food like ribs along with veggies for dinner, so produce a lot of grease.  The accessories are clearly presented, but I assumed I could find some better ones; there are dehydration racks that are too small and close together.  It would save space replacing two other machines if it were a good air-fryer also."
5,My third Panasonic Microwave. It is larger with increased wattage and works very well in less time.I love it.
1,"I've gotten this replaced already and the clock function still does not work. I've read the manual, the instructions to say press Clock | Timer once to set clock and it goes right to Timer just like a few others here have mentioned. Just a bad product I guess. Toshiba used to be a quality brand, huh.I got this for the silence function (which works beautifully) and, as far as I can tell, every other function works. The clock not working is a real deal breaker as it's what I usually consult while cooking, or if I'm wondering what time it is I usually look at the microwave before I even look at my phone. Now whenever I wonder about the time I'm told it's 0:00... guess I'll spend a bit more for a microwave that actually works."
2,First off microwave does work good and will cook frozen pizzas crispy with Convection feature. Problem is it in no way works as an air fryer. The heating elements are like a broiler on top and it takes a very long time to cook French fries through. Book in no way explains air fryer function or settings.
4,The media could not be loaded.Heavy unit. Think of how it will be handled arriving to you.
1,Not very happy. This microwave looks great but it doesn't heat a cup of water
5,"This is a very nice microwave.  It replaces one that served us well for a very long time but which started struggling to get foods fully cooked on a consistent basis.  This Panasonic is quite a step up in that it uses ""inverter technology"" to heat/cook your food much more evenly and in less time.  Be careful with it until you get it figured out, it will smoke a potato!  A great looking stainless steel microwave that is easy to use and really works well, I recommend if it's time to replace yours."
1,"After a year of doing what it’s intended to do it stopped working right outside the warranty. However it does work if you hold the power cord a certain way. So if you’re fine with standing directly next to it, holding the power cord just right, buy this unit."
4,your gonna need shelf space 24 inch wide x 19 inch deep and 14 inch tall this thing is big/ i replaced my 15 year old Panasonic that had inverter / ya 15 years old / i thought inverter was new? this is old technology.
5,I think this is too small for a family. But it works for a single person in an apartment.
1,"It works fine for the first 2-4 minutes then it's power drops off noticeably.  My wife noticed this a first (She cooks a lot of Jenny Craig).  Yesterday I reheated an ear of corn and it was steaming hot after  30/20 then 15 seconds.  Tonight, after she cooked her meals my ear of corn was still cold after 30/20/15.  I had to nuke it another 20/20. I missed the return window which SUCKS!"
5,Bought for use in the break room at work.  With 6 express buttons it takes less time to punch in cooking times to heat or cook items.  Cooks food well and thoroughly.
1,5 months after the service contract ran out this microwave's power supply failed. I calculate that it was used approximately 525 times. It was never moved once installed (in a well ventilated space) and always kept clean and dry. This customer will never buy a Panasonic product again.
5,"I liked that it had all the features of a larger one, but it is compact which was important to me because of the room that I had."
5,This appliance fits in the area I needed it in. It works very well  Does all the things I need it to do.
4,Easy to use and clean 👌
3,Beats cooking
1,"I bought this microwave because the add said "" Amazon certified : works with Alexa"". The microwave also has a lot of good reviews however the app that is associated with this item only has a 1 star review. It doesn't connect to Alexa. Alexa cant find it. I have spoken to both Amazon and Toshiba however the only actual solution I got was to return it. I live in the middle of no where and returning items is a hassle. I feel that the add shouldn't say its Amazon certified if it truly isn't. All the reviews for the app say it doesn't connect.Now after all that I would like to give the microwave itself a review. It's the perfect size. Looks good and works well manually. It does have a slight rattle but I think that's just the glass plate."
3,This is a nice looking microwave but it has a rumbling sound when you heat something up no idea why. At least it hasnt blown up yet
4,Make sure to go by the measurements in the pictures. Not from the product details.  Way smaller than expected. Still works. Would send back for larger one... Already sent one back damaged.Works as it should. Curious what the inverter difference will be like?
1,I wipe it down every time I use it and it's just me in the household so it's not like it's used everyday. The company refused to do anything about it because it was a little past the warranty. It took me nearly a month of constant emails to finally get them to even respond. Horrible customer service! I'll never buy another Farberware product after this experience.
4,Does the job Inner glass plate slides around and is quite annoying
4,"I bought this to replace the 800 Watt unit our household had before (mainly due to size) and we didn't think this microwave could fit in the same spot, but it does.Pros:Cooks food evenly and quicker than 800 Watt unit (obviously)The stainless-steel front has more of a high-end look to it.The ""popcorn"" setting actually works. I tested it out on a bag of Orville Reddenbacher's and the timing was perfect.Our rectangular large dinner plates fit and fully rotate. On the 800 Watt unit, we'd have to rotate the plates halfway through.This unit is very quiet and easy to operate.Con:It doesn't have an ""add minute"" button, or something similar to quickly nuke something for just a minute or two.Overall, a good purchase and would buy it again if needed."
4,"First off, this is an outstanding nuker. It's solidly built and very attractive. It actually cooks a little hot, so I have to dial down recommended cooking times by about 5-10%. I bought this primarily for it's smart home integration. I put it in a framed-out cabinet because we have a range hood now. I didn't want to have to get down on my hands and knees to set the timer, so I opted for ""Hey Google, microwave for 1 minute 30 seconds"" instead. Ok, it's not perfect. I actually got it working with the Alexa skill first as I had a problem linking my Google Assistant. Alexa has a larger command set, but it just didn't always work. I set about getting Google working which entails loading and configuring the MSmartLife app, then I was able to find it with Google Home. Google doesn't recognize a few commands (primarily the ""Stop"" command), but overall it's very functional and just works all the time (unlike Alexa). One quirk is that every so often, Google will start the microwave and seconds later will say it can't connect with it (I assume it's waiting for a non-arriving response from the oven). Also, when you say something like ""Set microwave to 30 seconds"", it will do so properly and then reply with ""Setting the microwave to 29 seconds"" (always a second less). If Toshiba would fully support Google Home (it's 90% there already), this would be a 6-star review."
5,"I received this and immediately used it.  I have always used a microwave to bake potatoes or heat leftovers.  This thing is GREAT!  EASY to use, warms and COOKS great.  (First time I've ever cooked anything in a microwave.)  Clean up is a breeze.It's so nice not to have to keep turning food so it'll get done/warm all the way through. It is large enough to accommodate anything I need and lightweight enough that my elderly body can move it.Yes, you need to measure the space you're going to put it in.  It's larger than you might expect.  I wanted larger.  At my age I don't have the energy to cook with a small microwave anymore.  I just place the food in there, press the auto sensor and in record time it's ready!  The first time myself and my husband both said, ""We know that's not ready!"" ,when the timer went off just a short time after placing the leftovers in for reheating.  Duh to us. Hot!  It does everything it is supposed to do and more."
4,"Well it did take us a while to figure how to use this model, which is why it is only 4 stars. Once we reread about the reheat sensor instructions, we were able to really nail this function. We were putting our leftovers or other dishes in a bit too dry. If we mixed in just a little water so that the sensor could do it’s thing, all has been much better. We’ve found that if we use a cover for the food, when the sensor starts to time is usually when our food is just right. If not, it’s easy to start it going for a bit to get it to just the right temperature. Other features such as 10 second minimum times took getting used to, but it’s all fine now. Noisy as others have mentioned, but not awful. The door is a dream. Closes so easily. Fingerprints do have to be cleaned off but that’s stainless steel. Our guest room has our old microwave so everyone’s happy now."
1,After about a year and a half the coating had bubbles and started flaking off.  By the rust development it clearly has been issue developing for a while. Don’t waste $100 on this garbage and just pay twice as much for a legitimate 1.7 with exhausting capability.
4,"Sleek, simple, functional!"
5,I looked everywhere when we moved it for a small mircowave when we moved in to fit on our counter! There still space between the microwave and cabinets.
3,"I had the microwave for 2 weeks, Really liked it.Interior light burnt out. Had to return for refund.Metal microwave feet slips, when you push the microwave door open.Door swings open quickly.Microwave is light weight.Will try a different brand microwave."
4,Liked that it fits on my counter.Liked that it's not too expensive.Didn't like it's only 900 watts instead of 1100 watts.Didn't like it not having handle on doorDidn't like the key pad but ... It will suffice since I had to have replacement microwave for small apt countertop.I could recommend but wished it was 1100 watts!
4,"It works fine after you get used to the layout and how it works.  The only complaint is from my wife, she says the popcorn setting isn't use it and forget it.  You have to listen for when it stops popping and immediately open the door or you get some burnt popcorn."
4,very light and slides on the counter when the door is closed
1,The LED light went out after less than one year
1,It's a microwave for heating up things and.But it's just dead it doesn't work.It wasn't the beginning and unfortunately I got rid of the box that came in.But it just doesn't work
3,"Yes this is compact and fits easily into a small space but the buttons are NOT easy to use and there is not in fact a way to silence this model at the 3 second mark. You do have to press hard in order to get the buttons to work and your time go enter. Also, you cannot just press the time in and go. It’s a whole process. This isn’t a one and done machine. You’re going to stand here for a min with this. Also, I worry that if you handle the door handle rough and it breaks off the plastic will be sharp and you will have to replace the whole unit. This isn’t a company I see having a replacement door on standby for their costumers, so get the 4 year warranty or the 6 year."
3,Complicated more than a microwave should be in 2016. Purchased this for my son to take to college but pulled it out when the one mounted in the cabinet went out. Biggest downside is there is no +30second button which my kids like a lot. But again it's going off to college with my son so we deal with it.
5,"Works exactly as described. It is a Space saver and the 30 second button is most useful. Numbers are visible to people of low vision but the other features are a bit small to read. Clock set up was confusing only because the 0 number was located below the regular number pads and what is printed underneath the 0 number is “Memory”. Took me 20 minutes to realized that that was the 0 number!!Original box that the Microwave was put in showed that the box had been dropped. The crushed side was heavily taped together with Amazon tape and the original was placed into another Amazon box. Therefore, microwave had 2 bent corners but not too visible if one is not looking.I expected that there would be some issue with delivery of a large heavy item!! However, the microwave does not seem to be affected!"
3,Very small inside. A regular bag of popcorn is too big for the microwave and won't rotate.
2,Stopped working in a year. What a waste of money.
1,"I don’t understand the number of positive reviews. Here is my honest reflection after having had this microwave for 3 months. I talk about the following below: (1) low power, (2) lingering smell, and (3) useless turntable.(1) Low Power. When I say low, I mean it can’t heat one cup of room temperature water in a mug. We had a much better built in microwave in our previous house and needed to buy a new one since our new house didn’t have one built in. We got this one for the small foot print. Unfortunately, it takes us more than twice the amount of time to heat foods and beverages as compared to our last one.(2) Lingering Smell. If you heat anything in there with any type of scent, be prepared to either leave the door open (and therefor the light on) overnight for the smell to dissipate or live with eating or drinking the scent of whatever was in there prior. If you heat fish, forget about using it for another day. I’ve used it to heat salmon one night and opened it up to heat a cold cup of coffee mid morning the next day only to be met by the most foul scent that can only come from old fish odor. Btw, i clean my microwave daily and it’s spotless so it’s not from food splatters.(3) the turntable is a piece of glass that sits on top of a loose plastic ring with three wheel and the whole thing slides ALL OVER THE PLACE. There are three grooves at the bottom of the glass turntable that is supposed to catch the center turning mechanism in the microwave. However, that will only happen if you precariously balance it in such a way that doesn’t slide around on the wheeled ring thing AND is perfectly situated in mismatched grooves. A hair off and the whole thing slides around again.I wish I had the time and energy to send this back when I still have the chance. Do yourself a favor and pass."
5,like it
2,"The price was good, but it didn't heat up enough to cook properly on the convection side. Returned mine and got better convection/air fryer."
1,"I wanted to like this microwave - I really did.  The right size, a good name, easy to use - what's not to love?When the problem of condensation appeared - immediately - I wanted to solve it.  The inside would be dripping wet - ceiling, door interior - everything.  Not from boiling over - just condensation!  I checked the fan - could hear it, could feel it moving air out.  I tried emailing the service department for Faberware - using the contact provided in the Instruction book.  There is no phone number to call.  I never heard from them.  Ever.Things break - I understand.  Things go wrong - I get that too.  But - not returning my email?  Twice?  That's when I decided to return the microwave."
5,I live the multi functions in one product.  Extremely easy to use
3,"First of all, the instructions are not very good, but honestly I should have had to use them.  A good microwave is pretty intuitive to operate for the most part.  I am still trying to figure out the programmed defrost/cooking settings.  Second of all, the buttons are not clearly delineated and sometimes I will accidently activate the button below the one I intended to be pressing or (more annoying) nothing happens at all, because I have not pressed in precisely the center of an un-outlined button on a completely flat surface.That being said, I like the size of the interior of the microwave, it is aesthetically pleasing and cooks appropriately once the right buttons are pressed."
4,"Form and function seem to be ok.  Was a slight dent in the side, but nothing major.  Blame that on UPS.The keypad is VERY dark, so unless you have a very well lit kitchen, I wouldn't recommend this unit.It's a bit noisy on startup but subsides withing a few seconds.  It reheated coffee in no time and is very spacious.  The air fryer feature is cumbersome to operate so far.  Doesn't come with the owner's manual.  You'll have to search the model number and download it.I've always preferred GE appliances, so we'll see how it goes."
2,we only used it a few times per week and it only lasted about 3-4 yearsit started making a horrific noise and sparking/ flaming like crazy from the side.it did not catch fire though which I appreciate
5,"This was the best deal we could find in 2021.  The only problem we found is, it takes a long time to toast bread.  Otherwise it’s been faultless."
5,"I love this larger microwave oven.  I had a nice mid sized GM before which recently died after about 8 years service.  This one is a step up with more ease of operation and a more generous size.  Panasonic says it has inverter technology, whatever that is.  It has to do with the strength of the heat which is so important in microwaves because the wave may bore burn holes in the food and destroy it.  The food does cook nicely in this oven.  I have yet to read an explanation that makes sense about how it works.  My family visited over the holidays and everyone noticed its beauty and size.  They all loved using it."
5,"This was just installed in our RV. The unit looks nice, its price was right, and so far, is working fine.Included is a carousel and an appreciated internal light."
4,This device sucks it didn’t last more than a month to two months
5,"This is the best microwave ever because after the cooking finishes it waits a few seconds before the beeps start!!! No trying to rush to open the door before the annoying beeps - you have time to get the job done!  Best invention ever!  Bravo!It works well, too.  But the pause on the beeps - simply marvelous, darling, marvelous!!!"
1,"I bought a $169.99 TOSHIBA ML-EM45P(BS) Countertop Microwave Oven, 1.6 Cu.ft with 13.6"" Turntable, 1200W, FREE Shipping & FREE Returns. See https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081T6GZZF/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&th=1 about Dec. 29th, 2022. I used it regularly, mostly to cook meat, without problems until March 28. It started making a loud humming noise that I had never heard before. A few minutes later I noticed dark grey smoke pouring out of it. I unplugged it and intend to return it ASAP.. I think that it has a one year warranty so I'll just request a replacement and hope that it will last longer.On March 31, 2023 the seller (TOSHIBA) wrote: ""We are pleased to inform you that your refund has been approved. Please expect delivery within 10-14 business days.""As of April 21 NO REFUND CHECK HAS BEEN RECEIVED. I may not buy from TOSHIBA again.I called Toshiba again on April 24 and was told that a check had been mailed on the 4th of April (3 weeks ago). I was told to call back on April 26. Every call takes too much time. I asked them to send me a replacement check that I can track. For many years the US Post office has been delivering mail to the wrong addresses in my area. Nothing can be done about it."
1,Box was very damaged upon delivery and I didn’t even notice until the next day after setting the microwave up in my kitchen that one whole side is dented in.
4,"Honestly, it's a microwave. It's just ok. It heats food, it's not terribly confusing, it's quiet, it looks ok.  It says it works as a built in but it did not include any hardware for this so maybe a game changer if that's what you're looking for. The door on ours does not open when you press the open button. It opens maybe a half inch and snags so you then must pull it open. Minor, I know but it's a pain when you have a beer in one hand and frozen hot pockets in the other and it seems like an easy thing to nail from a design standpoint... Anyway, would I buy it again? Probably not. I'd probably buy something with finger print free stainless and a door that worked but does it keep me up at night? Not really."
4,Small and fits in my pantry. Made popcorn when I first got it and it turned out great. The turn table is annoying and skips off easily. Just an annoyance.
4,"I have no problem with the seller.  the manufacturer is the problem.  I bought this in December 2021, while cleaning the inside  over week ago,  I noticed a bubble in the back.  when I touched it a piece of the lining fell off.  I wrote to Panansonic, and even though I included the date purchased, serial number, etc,  They asked for this information plus pictures.  It was difficult to take a picture of the inside, so they came back and said it was blurry, so I tried again.  Then they wanted pictures of the outside all 4 sides, it sits on a shelf so this was not an easy task.  This was almost a week ago and I still haven't heard anything.  I only bought this brand because it was during the  pandemic and it was the only thing available.  They also advised I not use it, can anyone else go over a week without using their microwave?  Today 1/25 I heard from them and they are sending me a refund"
3,"So, apparently, when reheating leftover food, there are 3 different categories and power levels that should be used.Use P10 (HIGH) when reheating liquids.*Use P7 (MED-HIGH) for MOST FOODS.Use P6 (MEDIUM) for dense foods.For defrosting, use P3 (MED-LOW).*If the power level is not adjusted per these categories, the food will cook unevenly.*If these categories exist, then which category does the “Sensor Reheat” button use? The only options for Sensor Reheat is “More time”, “Less time”, or “Normal time”. So, power levels and food type doesn’t matter when using the “Sensor Reheat” function. It don’t matter if you’re reheating liquid, most food, or dense food.*This is why the food heats unevenly. This requires too much thinking in order to get it right.What about foods that include both liquid and meat? What exactly does MOST FOODS mean? I finally understand why the sensor reheat function never worked after having 3 Panasonic Inverter Microwaves. I am finally done."
3,"It is loud!My cats are very scared of the noise.Thy run away when I am opening the door and turning on.Working good, look great, but to loud for small appliances."
1,"The product is nice, but it came damaged. The outside box seemed fine but when I went to install the microwave and open the box, I noticed the foam protection was broken into pieces. When unwrapping the rest, found product damaged."
4,"The only issue is that when it stops my cup of coffee is not centered, which could cause burns."
3,"I was replacing an LG microwave I really liked (other than after 3 years the door was not latching properly any more, but I use the heck out of microwaves every day, all day...) So I wanted the same model - no longer available s- went was looking for similar features. Don't currently like LG's lack of features so the Panasonic ""looked"" as tho it was close.I was wrong.First of all, when you shut the door it sound like it is made out of used tin cans. Not solid - tinny.Next, while it has the 30 second button, you cannot lessen or add to the time, like I had been able to with the LG. There is a ""plus"" and ""minus"" button right next to the 30 second button so I was mislead....those buttons are for the pre-programed cooking features...When cooking is done, it beeps momentarily, quietly, so if you miss the beep, there is no ""end"" displayed, you need to double check by looking inside to see that it actually is completed cooking. I liked seeing ""end"" and having recurring beeps until I opened the door. No such luck.I don't get a great feeling about this microwave. The best I can say is (right now) it works - but my gut says it won't last a terribly long time. Just feels chinsey.I miss the features the old LG had....but now a days everything is overly simplified....unless you want to spend a real fortune!I am not terribly happy...."
1,"I am not one to trash a product, but boy, they don't make 'em like they used to.  I am reviewing the small 700 W version.  The buttons are terrible.  You have to lean hard into them to accept your command, but the oven is so light, it slides all over the counter when you do that.  The back is not flush, with one side sticking out farther than the other, so , when you press hard into it, it settles into a crooked position.  The +30 second button does nothing for the timer, so, you can't add to the timer while it is running.  Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  This thing is worthless."
2,It was beautiful. Worked well for about 6 wks and then just quit.
5,"Easy to use, works perfectly and has great functionality."
1,Microwave broke within 5 months of buying. Highly do not recommend.
5,"Delivery was ontime, I use Amazon Key for garage delivery which is great when raining like it was when delivered.  Its larger than I expected which is good.  It should be good for reheating leftovers and the basics.  I'm not cooking a turkey in it but a small bird would fit if thats your thing.  Like some others the wifi setup is not perfect.  My only advice is to keep trying. It took me 3 restarts and clicking on the next button several times to get passed the initial setup.  Also took 2 tries for the second part of the wifi configuration but eventually it worked.  Adding to alexa was easy and worked as documented.  Install the skill before searching for the new device.  After I only had to say Alexa microwave for 10 seconds to test it out.  It worked like I would expect.  Good buy and good price but wifi setup was not as good as other smart devices."
4,Overall I like this microwave. It has a lot of handy features. The only drawback is you have to press on the unit when opening the door or it could tip forward.
1,I've had this micro a year and slowly after 3 months it started to cook slower and slower. Been a year and I ready had to throw it away a few weeks ago. It no longer turned on.
4,"This microwave seems to be loud when running. It works fine and the noise isn’t so much that I would return. I personally do not like the new control pads on most microwaves where the 1, 2, 3 buttons automatically start cooking for that many minutes.The microwave is a good size and does what one is supposed to do, although the popcorn setting is way too short and maybe I missed something in the book(since why would one have to read the book) but I have to double the popcorn cooking time. #firstworldproblems"
3,Works fine but has a constant humming noise. Can’t hear it unless door is open or microwave is turned on. Not worth the time to return and get another one so I’m just going to live with it
1,The microwave quit working 6 momths after I bought it.  I did not get the extemded warranty.Amazon told me it was Toshiba's problem.  Toshiba told me that the Amazon purchase confirmation (the only information I have) was not sufficient because it didn't show a physical location of purchase or how much shippimg was charged (free with Amazon Prime).I'm going to toss this broken microwave and will buy a replacement (NOT TOSHIBA) from a brocks and mortar store tomorrow.  No telling how many times this was dropped during transit.Lesson learned.
3,It’s compact and lite for office or dorm room
3,"Solid Microwave for the price. Takes alittle longer than usually to warm up food, got it for my office so it gets the job done, but I would recommend a stronger Microwave for a home, especially if it's going to be used alot."
3,"This microwave works perfectly fine. My only complaint would be that the timer only has one soft beep and then just turns off. I can't hear it at all unless I'm right there in the kitchen and it's made me burn cookies before. When you don't take your food out right away, however, it'll continue to beep in time intervals until you open the door."
1,"So what if it can do a number of things if it can't explain how they all work.  Case in point: AirFryer.  Apparently, it has an air fryer function.  This is the whole reason we bought it.  Couldn't tell you how it works tho.  There are some youtube videos that fail at it too.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Also, the buttons are a pain in the ass.  Almost always I have to press twice before it reads.  The problem is if you're in a hurry and you push one and it doesn't read the next button starts a different cooking function.  Then you have to cancel, start all over.  Microwaves were invented for convenience.  It is really just a mediocre product."
3,"It’s ok, but the buttons are really difficult to press and they’re mostly unresponsive unless I push super hard which is not convenient and makes it difficult to use."
5,"Perfect small size microwave.  Great for reheating mugs, small dishes and small plates.  A regular dinner plate fits in comfortably - not much larger will fit.  We got rid of our big microwave because we only reheat our coffee/tea."
3,Box was damaged and scratched all over. Smaller interior than I thought
4,I love the looks and micro wave works as expected only con I have is u need a flashlight to read panel when r they going to have a microwave with a pre lit panel I love it tho defrost works excellent my other microwaves cooked half the meat I’m using auto bake/roast today so far so good I just love it I have the black stainless steel
1,It exploded and is catching on fire 9 months after purchase- and no metal or inappropriate materials were placed in it.
2,Have only had this microwave for 2 months and already the membrane over the most commonly used places on the keypad is bubbling up.  Another issue is that the front door displays Kenwood rather than Farberware even though the label on the back says Farberware.
1,This was great for the first couple  months. I have had it not even 2 years. It pops the circuit every time I use it. It's really frustrating. Now it barely  heats too. It used to defrost a 16oz container in a minute now it takes 6. I like the design the dark grey inside. But this is the worst microwave I've ever had. My old one I had for 9 years. Worked great. I gave it away because it was still working great. I bought this one because  I just wanted  a newer nicer looking one. Pretty sad. I have to buy a new one again.
5,We ordered our RV prepped for a microwave and chose this to install.Unit arrived on time and well packed.It is working well our first week out.
5,I am able to place on a small table
5,"It’s the perfect size , easy to use and the popcorn button is the first one that has EVER cooked a bag of popcorn to perfection every time ."
5,"My daughter needed a microwave when she moved into her first place and this has been fantastic for her to use, clean, and it fits nicely on her counter."
5,I have low cupbards and was worried about the height and it works perfect. It has convience buttons with programmed times. It works very well. It has a removable tray and it rotates. It is very easy to sue and sety up. The color is great and the outside even cleans  very easily.
4,It works fine but it’s really loud.
3,"The keypad is a B otch to use. You have to push the buttons juuusst right or they refuse to work. Sometimes if you want to change a setting, you have to push stop before pushing any other buttons, even if you open the door. Most other machines, you don't have to do that.  If you can get the keypad to cooperate, it works just fine."
5,Since I heard no complaints ( and this person will complain ) it had to be good !!!
5,Great microwave. Like the large numbers on the panel makes it easy to read
4,"Although I love the multi function, it isn't user friendly and the little booklet is not very helpful.  It would be great if it had a recipe book with precise directions. We have had it for over a month. And still need to look up what function we should use, but often end up guessing."
5,Moved and my microwave didn't make it. This one is small and light which is awesome. I don't have much in the way of counterspace so this lives under my counter and comes out when I need it.So far it works fine. Of course I only use a nuker for left overs
1,"I wanted to like this oven as it has all the futures I wanted in a compact size. It is excellent on features and cooks fast and even. Problems:1. It is noisier than any other oven I ever used.2. The control button are not sensitive enough. You really have to push them hard and this sometimes causes the oven to move.3. Perhaps the most troublesome problem is the ""sensor reheat"" function.  I put a bowl of soup in; It heats for a very long time 3+ minutes; Then it beeps twice and adds 6 minutes to reheat time. However the soup is already boiling after 3 minutes. If you let the oven do its thing your soup will explode and perhaps cause a fire or destroy the oven. You can not use this function and walk away from the oven.4. I was not able to call Panasonic since they do not offer phone support (this is always annoying). Instead I chatted with them on-line and was told to pack up the oven and return it without any further explanation. I am not sure if this is a one-off problem or a design flaw."
4,Great inall aspects EXCEPT. There is a big overhang under door and if you apply any pressure getting food in or out the microwave tips forward!!!! Put a foam piece under it and that worked. Beware.
4,"The size, color, and features are nice but I think at least 900 watts would make this type of unit much more practical and efficient."
5,"This is a good microwave oven. It has lots of the settings one would expect, but personally, I avoid using presets for microwave ovens. Not all food fits the present exactly. It's easier for me to just adjust the cooking time and power, which this does easily too. You can even set different power levels for a single cooking session. True laziness in action. This is a pretty good size too. It's small and portable yet is big enough to hold most items. Just be realistic here. Don't expect to microwave a massive mutant turkey or a whole pig leg...and even if you could fit that, don't be so lame and lazy to microwave a whole ham or turkey.This is a very good effective microwave for the price."
3,Lasted about a year then died! Clock was a pain to setup also. I'd stay away from this Micr-NO-wave!!!
5,"I purchased this microwave oven for our new home as we left our old one behind.  I didn't do a whole lot of research on different models but have been pleasantly surprised. It is roomy and I love the handle on the door. Our old one had a push button that was difficult to use.  There are many settings, some of which I haven't tried yet, but overall, I am happy with my purchase."
4,Great oven ..works great so far
4,"I gave this microwave 4 stars. It’s what I expected for the price but the inside is smaller than I expected it to be.  I can’t put a dinner plate in it, but I will make it work.Go up a size for the dinner plate."
5,Looks good works great.
4,"The microwave is very nice overall , the only issue I have with it is that the glass plate does not fit into the grommets properly and you have to be careful when taking out the food, it might slip off and brake.."
5,Perfect
4,The turning control is not good enough to use it!
5,"Great small appliance , does the warmup of food or coffee as needed"
3,"After approximately 16 months of use, the light started flickering during operation. Now, it is usually off while the microwave is in operation, thus I am unable to see the item that is cooking. This makes it impossible to check items that might boil over, such as oatmeal, without pausing the microwave and opening the door. Apparently, this is a common problem with this microwave, but since the warranty period is one year, there is no satisfactory repair option. The oven was great until this started happening; now it is not so great."
4,Definitely isn't the quietest microwave in the world. There's a lot of reverberation through the casing when it's on. In my experience at least it definitely does not work with Google home. I'm not sure how some other people have gotten it to but I'm an IT technician with 20 years of experience and doesn't work for me. All in all a decent microwave that should do what I need it to.
1,"Bought this Panasonic microwave with high hopes. When I received the item, it looks very cheap. In addition, this microwave is extremely noisy. I decided to go with a cheaper microwave from Walmart, and it's a LOT quieter and it was only $70. I do not think anybody should shell out this much for this microwave. Very disappointed."
3,"After using it for 2 weeks, I eventually sent the NN-SN936B back because it is not user-friendly (to my wife & I).I can adapt for the greater good of the Inverter technology treating my food better, but she mostly steams a frozen bag of vegetables, heats popcorn, or boils a mug of water; GE & Sharp have already trained her to push one button one time to get that done.The [add 30secs] button is a start & she appreciates not having to worry about exploding food but did not outweigh the shortcomings.The control pad is very fashionable but she found it hard to read as the moven is on the countertop.This might have changed had it replaced our 12-year-old GE moven that’s 35cm higher but the markings on the buttons are otherwise too hard to read (in a well-lit kitchen).The simple display looks really cheap, is far less sophisticated than our (not high-end) GE moven, & limits how much the controls can accommodate.It’s the same display that goes into cheap, basic movens for other manufacturers.For 20 years HGTV has pushed everyone to insist on stainless steel (appearance) but we’re sticking with all black appliances, which is why we didn’t buy a higher-tear model but started looking at the NN-SE995S with a backlit display & Cyclonic Inverter.The NN-SE985S seems to be the US equivalent to the Canadian NN-SE995S.The old GE moven’s beep is harsh but has easy 3-step loudness control.The fan on the GE may be as loud as the fan of the Panasonic but is enclosed in a cabinet with a trim frame.When I wanted to (gently) heat my morning oatmeal in the NN-SN936B, I had to close doors to keep from waking up my wife (18 meters away) due to the loud, harsh beep & loud fan of the Panasonic moven.We are experienced & educated people who have never been afraid of technology & could not get this moven to turn off the beep by following the instructions.I downloaded the owners manuals for 5 other Panasonic moven models & attempted to apply the beep mute instructions from them to this moven & the beep could not be turned off, to say nothing of the lack of volume control for a moven at this price point.Even my first Sharp moven bought at K-mart in 1987 had much easier controls & beep volume control than this one.Each of 5 power level settings had its own button on that one.I have been using movens at lower power-levels with 2 step session programming since 1987 & most reheat leftover food, canned soup, or oatmeal, all at far less then the highest power level.Leftover meats, pastas, breads, & pizzas have been successfully re-heated without the infamous microwave side-effects because I use lower power levels to warm the food without annihilating it.As a countertop model, we’d easily know when it has finished as the sound of the loud fan stops (from anywhere in our 3000 sq ft house).If a volume control or mute is too difficult to design, then maybe replace the beep with a ting sound.I chose Panasonic because I’ve wanted attenuated steady-stream microwaves since 1987.The top 5 movens on Consumer Reports ratings list are Panasonic, as well as the 7th, so I felt confident in buying this one & I almost NEVER RETURN any purchase (even when I should have).A LOT has to be wrong with an otherwise undamaged, non-defective appliance for me to send it back.I might have given the brand new moven away to someone we know rather than sending it back except that we don't know anyone who could put up with these deficiencies either.We so want the Cyclonic Inverter technology but COULD NOT LIVE with the rest of this moven.I anticipated that the moven market would generally have trended towards online connectivity and/or Bluetooth apps for mobile phones by now but the user interface has instead gone backward here.Panasonic’s bold choice to omit the number pad on some of their moven models is commendable; my wife & I don’t mind adapting to some of what Panasonic is trying to blaze a trail for, but we wouldn’t care to repeatedly press the [Power Level] button 5 or more times, or pressing another button up to 20 times to select a sensor mode from a chart that we’d have to post near the moven.Panasonic should probably entertain going dot matrix VFD or active matrix or even touch screen active matrix before a customer can plausibly, if not comfortably, navigate a “Genius” sensor-driven selection menu.Our old GE moven still works & still looks like new (buttons didn't wear out).It’s just getting tired & we wanted an upgrade but made the mistake of focusing on the Inverter concept, taking it for granted that the controls would be not-too-intolerable compared to what we’ve historically seen from GE & Sharp.We had made the decision to tolerate the 12% of stainless steel (appearance) on the face of the NN-SE985S & replace the NN-SN936B with that but then realized that we don’t have a failed moven leaning on us to replace it right now."
3,Wow that oven was WAY larger than I expected. One of the drawbacks of online buying; you can't see it first.
5,Love that its all in one. It is a bit smaller than the amazon branded sold a while ago but still does the job.
4,The media could not be loaded.Love it had to buy the coffee combo as well
3,Don't know how to use it.
4,Good Microwave
1,Stopped heating after two months of light use. Appalling that something would break so soon. It didn't hear and would just run like normal but no heating was occurring.The inside was dark and tiny and the beeping was way too loud. The door was also loud.
5,"It's small and fits on my counter. Easy to use. Has 900 watts of power, and fits my needs for now. Recently had rotator cuff surgery and can not raise my right arm to lift or hold things yet. I didn't feel safe using my left hand to use my over the stove microwave, especially a hot, heavy dish... so I got a small countertop model. I'm still using it for the convienence and the ability to heat two items at the same time!PS: The arm is fine now!"
5,"It’s the perfect size for any countertop. It’s a space saving kitchen gadget. So if you’re looking for a small to small/medium countertop microwave, this will probably suffice. Black & Decker is a reliable brand and you get what you pay for with their products. They’ll definitely give you time and remain operational irrespective of overuse and/or “abuse” aka constant usage 😉. What I found interesting is the box with the microwave smelled so clean with the scent of cherry syrup like that used to make soda. I was so surprised by the scent I remembered my childhood and bartending! A small detail yet I appreciate when packaging is done properly and the item arrives as promised. Black & Decker definitely performs QA/QC with their equipment. No bells or whistles to this microwave and I didn’t need one that did anything special. I come from a line of chefs and started cooking at the age of five. I don’t use microwaves to cook but to heat coffee and at times food. This item suits my needs."
5,"The media could not be loaded.I been looking for a microwave on here for a couple months but didn’t want to pay some of the outrageous prices, plus I just need a simple microwave not anything to fancy. I came across this one for $80 something dollars but my cheap butt still didn’t want to pay that. So when it dropped down to $72 I was sold and bought it right away. Small and simple and the inside is a bit bigger than what you would expect looking from the outside in. I’m satisfied with my purchase for sure. 👍🏾"
2,"This microwave is horrible, 20 minutes to thaw out a pound of meat. Pops half a bag of popcorn then start burning it 2 minutes to warm up a corn dog.  This microwave is no good"
1,Have had about 3 years and keypad just stopped working. Very junky microwave right from the get-go.
1,"The open-door button broke within 3 months of use, the surface of all buttons started wearing and is now looking very ragged within 6 months of use. Still heats food but not good quality."
3,"Stylish, sleek, quiet, and roomy. What’s not to like? I’ll share that, dear readers, and you’ll have food for thought to put in the farberware, or perhaps a different one.I had a nice little 900w ge that was great, though not quite big enough for some dishes. So my impetus in buying a new one was first to get a roomier box, and while I was at it, something with a bit more power. Never mind the ge died a horrendous death after a good 10 years or so.There were many 1-touch features on the ge that I really wanted, namely the :30 button. This can’t live without feature is such a time saver. Hit it once that’s your start and :30 seconds all rolled into one tap. A very handy button and surprisingly not available on many microwaves. So you hit the :30 and if you want you can keep on hitting it and adding :30 each time. Awesome! The ge had that and several other 1 button timings. So those and space for a larger baking dish and a bit more power led me to look at a Samsung, another ge, and the farberware. I didn’t just look. I bought all three so I could get a true sense of their worthiness. The ge, while it still had many identical features of its dead ancestor was really very cheaply made. You could almost see your hand behind the microwave if you opened the door and looked at the back the metal was so thin. It was also noisy. Back in the box, and shame on you, ge, shame on you.The Samsung was nice and had a broiler built in, ostensibly to cook pizza or something that might benefit from top-browning as it spun around. It was also extra tall in order to accommodate the broiler unit and came with a special broiler dish holder, which of course is just another accessory to have to store the 95% of the time you’re not broiling in the microwave. I have a toaster oven for that, one you need a pilot’s license to operate, but that’s another review...So while the Samsung could have been a contender with ample space, power and controls, it didn’t have a :30 sec button, but did have a 1 minute button, a substantial difference in the world of microwaves. Back in the box, Samsung, nice try but get back in there.Which brings us to the farberware, and in case you were wondering, it’s not the farberware of yesteryear that made amazing, lifelong quality goods for the kitchen. It’s farberware as in marketing ploy to get people to buy into perceived quality. Like so many other companies have done, the farberware name was purchased, like Polaroid, like schwinn, because how else can you sell crap without a good name to stand behind. So after going back and forth online trying to decipher size, power, features etc. between the aforementioned units and the 2 farberware ovens I found, I decided to go with the sleek silvery one, which won out in my home testing over the other 2. I should be happy, yes? It has all those time features so critical to me. It has lots of space. And perhaps that’s the problem. I am not an engineer or profess to know a lot about how microwaves cook. But I am able to compare the cooking time and thoroughness of foods I used to defrost or cook in my old ge to that of the farberware, which has 100w more power. Yet, oddly enough, it takes longer - much longer - to cook in. And there are many hot/cold spots, very uneven cooking. So I suspect it’s because the microwaves bounce around in the bigger space and aren’t as concentrated as they would be in a smaller unit. In my ge I could put a frozen bagel on a plate inside the oven, hit my beloved :30 and take the bagel out at :12 and it would be 99% thawed. In the farberware that same bagel (ok, an identical one) takes more like :40-:50, and one part will burn your hand while the other part is just barely thawed.So maybe I expect too much from a large microwave. It’s certainly easy on the eyes, quiet enough except for the truck backup beeps, and it’s big. I’ve had it since fall 2017. I guess I’ll deal with the uneven cooking until the next great thing comes along or when it goes to the great appliance graveyard. If you’re ok with smaller box, different time cook settings and design then I’d suggest you try a different unit. Good luck!"
5,We needed a small microwave and this does the trick
1,"I needed a microwave but wanted to go for a reputable brand rather than cheaper alternatives. This was such a disappointing experience. When I opened the Amazon box and saw the microwave box itself, I immediately noticed that it looked hastily taped together. There was a lot obvious damage to the box which, to me, suggests carless storage and handling in a warehouse. Given the amount of other options available and taking into account the price of this machine, I would expect at least some sort of effort to retain brand recognition or loyalty but this product fails to do either.Optimistically, I decided to open the box further and remove the blue film covering the door. The presence of this film would have alleviated my concerns that this was a defective item being resold, however, the film was completely scrunched up (potentially, reapplied?) and if anything, only convinced me further. The instructions were inside the microwave and creased/folded randomly/scrunched-up.The ""nail in the coffin"" was the scratches all over the numerical pad. They are permeant and glaringly obvious from every angle.I am willing to admit that I could be slightly presumptuous automatically assuming this is used - perhaps it is not. Nonetheless, the condition of this microwave makes it look like it fell off the back of a truck.There are plenty of people who are happy to buy a microwave with aesthetic faults but I do not believe any of those individuals would pay full price - myself, included. The inside looked clean and the power outlet is neatly folded. I assume anyone who possibly had this before me, saw the condition it was in and returned it immediately. I will be doing the same.Store your products with more care. List 'used' stock correctly.It is just a microwave. It is not the end of the world but please have some basic respect for the people buying your products."
1,I have had this Microwave for about eight months have had nothing but trouble for the last month when we start the oven it stops after one or two seconds display says H97. When I try to get help they say try a chatroom when you go to chat room they email how to fix it only works one or two times than same thing.Try to send it in  for service they give no help on wear to send it and you have to pay for shipping.Not a good product and no service help.
2,"I’ve had this appliance for a couple years and it worked okay, though I noticed microwave popcorn always burned. Today, I was heating up some food and noticed a flame coming from the side of the microwave. The food was not in any packaging. I had literally had it in for 15 seconds. This thing just caught fire. I immediately unplugged it. Thank god I was standing right there and was able to unplug it very fast. I will not be buying from this brand again."
4,"This Chefman 0.7 cu ft Countertop Microwave is small but does the job.  I’m so happy it matches the other stainless appliances in my kitchen.  It makes such a difference that everything matches now. We just use the microwave for reheating leftovers and popcorn.  It cooks popcorn faster than my old dinosaur of a microwave so I burned the first bag, even counting the pops.  Now I’ve learned and popcorn comes out perfectly.  I gave this microwave 4/5 stars because the tray comes off the track very easily when I’m putting something in it or taking something out of it.  It doesn’t alter the function, it’s just annoying.  Otherwise I really like it."
5,"This microwave was top tier. It outperformed all the other previous units. It's quick, sturdy, and well priced."
3,"Liked this microwave.  Relatively quiet - didn't take up too much space.  Not terrible looking.  However, just like microwaves past, two years in I put something in the microwave and it started vibrating and the lights flashing.  Tried to unplug it and do it again and same thing happened. I now see burn marks on the inside metal panel.  Time to get another sadly."
1,"Click, LED display, and rotating table worked but NO HEAT!"
1,Nice but why is does not have a clock ???
2,It was smaller than I wanted
3,WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL GOING FROM A FRIGADAIRE TO THIS BRAND BUT IT DOES GOOD FOR THE PRICE. THE DOOR IS A LITTLE ASKEW OUT OF THE BOX BUT IT HAS ALL THE USUAL FEATURES AND 1100 WATTS
2,"this thing sucks, so loud to open and shut the door. the alarm beeps 5 times, loudly when the food is done. opening the door does not stop it. cant stand this microwave but it is cheap. would not buy again."
3,Noise level bad!!
3,"I bought this model because it was big, had high CU score, and I could get it quickly.It’s powerful and quiet, however I downgraded my score because the top & bottom corners of the open door have protruding sheet metal that are laceration hazards.  I managed to gash my forearm on the lower corner when I reached in to place the glass turntable before I ever even used the microwave.  This is a design defect that could be easily corrected.  About design- I find I miss actual control buttons.  It would be nice to have a tactile feel or a lighted panel so I could nuke my midnight snack without having to turn on the kitchen lights."
1,"I never write reviews but felt this one necessary to write. I really liked this microwave initially. I ignored the bad reviews because it was large and wattage was perfect for us. It made a horrific noise one day (like an airplane landing in my kitchen). Then it died. Bought in September 2021, dead Jan 2022.I contacted Toshiba who was great - out of the gate offered me a refund!Even though this product comes with a 1 year warranty - they didn't offer to fix or replace the item. Nor did they ask for the broken item back.That NEVER happens unless the company knows they have a bad product. Stay away"
1,Microwave sucks! Does not heat up my food evenly and takes forever. Makes the plate hot and food stays coldDont waste your money.
2,"Quit working on the 2nd day and had to call for help. The push open is very hard to get open, wish I had gotten a different microwave"
4,Works fine. The glass plate is a bit tricky to secure because it has no indents but otherwise I would say it does what a microwave needs to do.
3,"If you just heat up coffee or hot pocket kind of things then this might be ok, but it does not take long at all for this to get very hot on top and sides, which is not safe or normal for a microwave.  I only use it on standard regular power and don't ""cook"" with it but use to heat fully cooked things or defrost assist.  I have on occasion used it to cook a baked potato.  But it has not been but a couple of months and the film on the buttons most used is are rough as if de laminating off and heats up unusually hot on outsides which makes me nervous..."
1,"This microwave stopped rotating less than 2 months after purchase, therefore food was not warming up evenly or would just burn. This product is supposed to come with a year warranty but i contacted their customer service (no option to call by phone) so i emailed. I received a response back saying they are transferring my case to the appropriate department and i never heard back from anyone even after i sent many follow up emails. I will NEVER buy a panasonic product again because of the terrible service after purcahse. Very disappointed."
2,"Just bought this microwave because it had so many good reviews and was under $100. As soon as I plugged it in it started making this weird humming, similar to an electrical current while but even in use! It was very noticeable every time I went into the kitchen and that was concerning.  I became worried about how safe it might be after reading reviews about others catching on fire. Returning."
4,Nice basic machine.  Usefull with limited counter space.  Slips about a bit when buttons are pressed.  There's an online table that shows how to convert regular 1100 degree settings to 700.
1,"The only instructions were a quick guide, mostly warnings what not to do.  WHERE IS THE OPERATING MANUAL?  I have no idea how to use this appliance."
2,"2 days after the 3 month warranty was up the inside light started blinking,  now it comes on or off when it is supposed to be on.  I did not find a way to contact anyone because the time was up.  I suggest getting an extended warranty if you do decide to purchase this item!!!  The microwave and the oven do work but I find it very irritating for the light to not work."
4,Would be 5-stars except the buttons are too small. Sure wish that the buttons were lighted.
1,If you just want a lit carousel to watch cold food and drinks revolve wasting energy then this is the best option to get.
1,"It doesn't sit well. The bottom grip is uneven.  The door is not aligned and half open. Has a dent when I opened it. The box is broken,  u can tell its a returned item. So frustrated, been a prime member for years and never had a history of returning items. 😪"
1,"I received the Panasonic NN-SN936W Countertop Microwave in the manufacturer's carton without additional packaging, delivered in later Nov 2017. Minor corner abrasions and a couple of minor punctures were inconsequential.Today, however, the door release mechanism failed to release the door. I had read that this was a common problem but I was expecting that the higher-end unit, such as this one was, would be made better. Bottom line- the door latch failed in just over 6 months.Now I have to pay MORE to ship this back someplace yet unknown for repair! I went to the Panasonic web site as directed by the manual and attempted to locate where to send it. Panasoinc's tool completely failed to proved an answer! I used both the generic ""microwave"" product selector and the model-specific selector. I used all of the offered ""distance from me"" selections. NOTHING was provided. A chat attempt resulted in ""website not found"". A phone call to Panasonic after 3 PM Mountain time resulted in ""we are closed"".Update: My wife is paralyzed and has the use of only one arm/hand. She used this microwave from her wheelchair with the mw on the counter. This put her outreached arm angled up at the counter's edge with her hand close to the counter on which the mw sat. With the door latch problem, to open it she had to use her (left) hand's thumb to depress the latch button with simultaneously her fingers under the door edge and wedged between the door and the mw body and flicking her fingers. This caused the door to rapidly fly open and then strike the top of her forearm. The inner corner of the door edge was sufficiently sharp for it to cut her arm and leave a bruise. After this happened 3 times we contacted the CPSC and Panasonic. We sent it back to Panasonic and after 2 months gone and unanswered inquiry we were told that they ran a standard test (in a manner not replicating my wife's use and possibly not even on the edge at issue) that there was no sharp edge! We disagreed and challenged their testing methods in light of the fact that she was injured 3 times before she stopped using it. So, a sharp edge sufficient to cut her arm exists which Panasonic denies and therefore likely won't make any changes, so you judge for yourself."
4,Wife loves this item
4,Everything is good expect that round plate it keeps moving while it is on. I could have rated 5 stars for that.
2,Plate always slides off. Too deprivation. And started smoking after a year and a half
1,"I would have thought that this would have lasted more than 18 months, especially since it it only used for heating and reheating items for a few minutes (usually seconds) at a time!  To say I'm disgusted is an understatement!"
1,"I liked this microwave, except for two things:Even before it abruptly quit working, the door closes with a loud clanging noise which reminded me of a 1980's econobox car's door closing with deteriorated weather stips.  I've had many microwaves over the decades and the noise of this one's door closure is downright obnoxious.But worse, it abruptly stopped working after 335 days.  It consistently powers down after 2-seconds of starting.This is not my first Panasonic Inverter.  But, I've never seen one die so prematurely."
5,Compact microwave that works just great for heating things up. Doesn't take up too much space on the counter and matches my appliances.
5,Just about everything
1,"We love it BUT today, have had the replacement unit break. First time it was under return warranty - door stopped shutting. Replacement blew out it’s something electrical (all plugs checked) & only the blue flashing lights work, 5 days after return warranty.Would  have given it a 2nd replacement shot, but now, don’t buy one for the hassle to a 78 year old woman!!"
3,"Why put the stickiest 'remove film' sticker possible right on top of the display that leaves a mess when trying to remove? Put the sticker on TOP of the easily removable film, not underneath"
5,this microwave is better than my other microwave i love it so much it heats up my food so much and i love that it’s a 3 in 1 i can do so much with it it works much better than a regular a microwave i’m satisfied with my purchase.
5,"Good size and quality, it runs quietly and looks good in my kitchen."
1,"It was competent microwave for almost a year, then  developed problems: the glass dish frequently slips off its holder, and it somehow started retaining A LOT of moisture with each use. If I've used it the night before, there are large water droplets covering the inside still there in the morning. This has caused rusting around the inside edges of the door."
5,"This is a great microwave, has good heating power, definitely would recommend"
2,"I used to have an air fryer that I loved and it died.  So I thought I'd buy this with more capabilities especially since it got such great reviews.  It came with no instruction booklet.  I tried to air fry several times and all it did was heat the food.  NOT an air fryer.  There is this high wire platform you are supposed to put the food on which essentially does nothing to help fry the food.  Overall, totally a waste of money for me since the real thing I wanted was the air fryer. Is a microwave nice to have now - sure. But I wouldn't pay $189 for a microwave."
3,"This microwave is light, making it very difficult to open the door. Buttons have to be pressed two or three times to work. I regret buying this microwave and it will end up in the garage at some point. I wish I would have chosen to invest in a better quality microwave."
3,If you are getting this to replace a microwave that's knocking out wifi stay away from this one. Good power output and features other than that big issue of killing the wifi for a 50-100 ft radius anytime it's running.
3,It's a great little microwave but only landfill material unless you don't want to know if your food is boiling over.  Had mine for over 2 years but the light bulb went out and you cannot replace it. So a perfectly usable appliance is going to end up in the land fill.
1,This was a second microwave I used very infrequently at my office and used approximately 4 times a week for 2 years and then it sat unused for 1.5 years and was used 1-2 times per day for 3 months before it wet berserk (now it starts running completely on its own as soon as its plugged in and the keypad doesn't work).  Do not buy.
1,Worst microwave ever I’ve only had it for a few months and it already fried
3,I would not buy another Toshiba product after dealing with them.
4,Well made compact microwave at a reasonable price.y
3,"I know Toshiba is a brand name but I really never used any of their products that I know of. The microwave is a little complicated for me you have to press a button twice before you can do seconds if you are heating something up. Got out handbook out several times trying to remember the steps. So far I haven't found much to do with Alexa,  I'm still learning that part. And the microwave rocks. It is heavy and I don't know how to fix, it so I've got to call Toshiba on that."
5,I am using the microwave every day. I have cooked biscuits in the oven but they were doughy. I did something wrong I guessI have not used the air fryer yet. I don't cook often.
5,"Small enough to carry for camping trips, large enough to cook for 2 people.I use a 1200w solar generator to power it."
5,"Fits in small area , shelf in kitchen."
1,"I bought this microwave a couple of days ago through prime. The shipping was fast and uncomplicated. But that's where it ends. The microwave doesn't work. When trying to heat something up, it loooks like it's working aka makes sound, lights go on, timer goes down, but nothing gets heated. Tried everything. Sadly I can't send it back because stupid me threw away the box and the manual - granted that was dumb.Stay away!"
2,"It costs 50% more than the equivalent Daewoo I was replacing. I was expecting it to be better. It is worse. The user interface replaces simple operation with a greater focus on programmed functions without nonvolatile memory. For the $30 premium over Daewoo I would have expected Toshiba to splurge 20 cents on a microcontroller with a bit of flash to at least remember my settings, if not the time. In 3 months it malfunctioned. Midea-Toshiba support intelligently listened to my explanation of the problem and sent me a refund. I can't recommend this specific appliance but the company is honorable and I highly recommend them."
1,"Purchased 7/20.  Nice looking.  Mostly works OK.  But the electronics are pathetic.  The clock and the 3 manual memory settings started going bad periodically within a year and have progressively gotten worse.  Now the 4 features all fail and have to be reset daily.  I can understand mechanical features failing so soon, but no reason for electronics to fail so soon."
1,Microwave was great while it lasted but broke a month in and no warranty information.
4,"I bought this to replace an older, nearly identical unit that was getting very noisy. (That is, .7 cu ft and 700 watts.) I wanted a small GE because you can turn the beeps off, which is not true of most microwaves.It basically does what it's supposed to. It is quieter than the old one. Its outside dimensions are also smaller, which is nice.My reasons for dropping a star are twofold:1. The dingy white on black controls are very hard to read. You have to get a good angle or very bright light. My old one was black on white and very readable.2. This .7 cu ft is noticeably smaller than my previous .7 cu ft GE model. The turntable diameter is the same, but the space around it and the door opening is smaller. Note that if you buy a similar model that is convertible to under-cabinet mounting, the turntable is smaller than this one."
4,The only thing that was difficult at the beginning was becoming aware of the different features of the microwave. It is not as easy to warm things without thoroughly reading the instructions. You can enter the minutes you want to have something warmed but you have to be careful because the number pads are close enough that you can hit the wrong number easily.
2,"Great size and power but I bought the same model 14 months ago and it started spinning with the  door open on day.  Probably not a good thing!  Checked youtube and it is probably a 5 dollar switch so I will fix the dead unit and use it for a back up. That is after I get the  tamper resistant screws  out, how annoying!"
5,"I was quite hesitant to buy this microwave,  yet I wish I bought it sooner. Perfect for people with visual issues. Alexa integration was simple."
1,Smoke started pouring out of after using it for about a week.  A terrible product
1,"As soon as I opened the box I saw this was not brand new out of the box and had already been returned by someone else.  We took it out of the box anyway and plugged it in...nothing.  No light on the panel as shown in the instructions and none of the buttons worked.  There were fingerprints and smears on the front door.Very disappointed.  Amazon, if someone returns a product that doesn't work, you really need to make sure before you resell it."
4,"I actually really like it, it just makes a loud buzzing noise that keeps me paranoid...lol! No trouble so far though."
4,The microwave works very well and is easy to use.  It is MUCH louder than microwaves we have had before.
4,The only thing I would improve are the buttons. You have to push really hard to make them work.
2,"We shopped for this after our Kitchen Aid model we bought 10 years ago quit on Sept 19. The microwave quit heating on Nov 7th. We needed a smaller unity that we could place off the counter for space availability. We read the reviews carefully. Unfortunately, this has stopped warming things up. With a limited warranty, we will see what happens when we try to receive compensation. I will update this review when I find out."
4,nice unit only downfall was no instruction booklet you have to go on line and download it which was a pain as had to go to neighbors to use printer
5,the first time i used this unit i set my food at the same settings i had previously used on my old microwave.smoke started pouring out of it. The food had burned up! I had to start setting  everything one half as long as i previously  did because this little unit was so powerfull!
1,Unit gets wet on the inside of door and top... I've called the manufacturer and they stated the wet portion is condensation and will not exchange it. Stating all of their units are doing this. Seems pretty dangerous if you ask me. Waste of money and time. Now I have to return it and get a reduction of my money by $20 bc of this defective product.
1,"We use the microwave a lot!  This was nice when it worked. This morning we used it twice, then I tried to heat water for a cup of tea, it worked for about 20 seconds and then just died."
4,"Good quality. Sensor cooking works great, very noticeable when reheating leftovers. Has a soften/melt function which is hard to find at this price point. Do have to watch, though, as the butter I want to soften often melts.Also, it would be nice to have some of the functions on a small cheat sheet - there is a label inside the door for reheating. But the defrost and soften/melt ones would be nice to have even just on a single page in the manual - maybe so it could be removed and hung inside a cabinet or something.Overall very happy with it."
4,This one is more powerful than what the wattage states.
3,"We were replacing a 1.4 cu. ft. microware.  This one, advertised as 1.4 cu. ft. seemed perfect.  When it arrived, my wife said it looked smaller inside.  I compared the published internal dimensions of both units.  The 1.4 we had did calculate out to 1.43 cu. ft. (14.69x10.75x15.63 = 2468.25 cu. in. divided by 1728 cu. in. per cubic ft.).  The GE internal dimensions (as advertised, and they are correct) are 13.82x15.98x9.8= 2164.27 cu. in. divided by 1728 cu. in. per cu.ft. = 1.25 cu. ft.)"
4,"I gave this to my son to replace a tiny, under powered microwave that came with his apartment. He is thrilled to be able to fit dinner plates and decent sized casserole dishes in this microwave. Now he can pop popcorn bags too! He also likes that it has a door handle instead of the push button release. His only complaint is that the ""beeps"" are not very loud and there is no reminder beep if you don't open the door. Nice microwave for the price!"
5,So far easy to use and seems effectiveEasy to understand panel.Good countertop size model at very good price
1,I ordered this microwave at the end of December when my microwave died. Thought it would be a nice upgrade and liked the size. I don't cook much. It's April and I am finally getting around to trying the convection part out and it made a loud sound when preheating so I checked online videos and it is broken. The microwave feature works fine. It's past the return date. I'm really sad that I spent $250 on a microwave when I could have gotten a cheaper one.
2,Too loud
1,It was fun to use with Alexa in the beginning. Within weeks it couldn’t keep the correct time for long. After the time was set a few days later it would change its self to an hour behind. Eventually I just left it and let it be an hour behind. The Alexa feature was hit or miss. Sometimes working and sometimes not.  Now 9months later it acts as if the door is open when it’s closed. The light stays on and the microwave does not start. So I guess the only thing it could be used for at this point is the timer function. Unfortunately I don’t keep boxes and what not so I’m assuming I have to just throw it away.
4,"Update: Around Mar 1 2021 this stopped responding to Alexa due to an update to the Msmartlife app.  Alexa integration cannot be restored,  the new MS app will not even open. I would not be quite so bothered by this were it not for the fact that the app/Alexa integration is necessary to access all the microwave  presets. I am not the only one with this issue. It's even in the app reviewsAlexa still shows the microwave skill as enabled.So, I might as well have saved my money and kept my not smart microwave. THIS SHOULD NOT BE STILL BEING SOLD AS ALEXA ENABLED. IT'S  NOT.The microwave itself is just great, fast, nice presets, bright interior light, amazingly quiet, has worked  well with everything I've tried. When I bought this I was in the market for an 1100W smallish microwave with smart sensor. I found the non Alexa enabled model and was about to buy that when I saw this for not much more and I have Alexa and an Echo Dot and had managed to add a Bluetooth  speaker and Roku TV, found that handy and effortless,  intuitive to do. Setting this up was anything but easy, effortless,  intuitive despite the fact I followed step by step instructions and watched several YouTube videos. I had no trouble downloading the MSmartLife app both from the Google store and using the QR code after adding a QR  reader to my phone. But after a number of tries and installing and deleting the app I could not get past the initial screen agreeing to and accepting terms and conditions.  I did finally get this to work and was able to connect the microwave and add it to Alexa but it took hours and probably years off my life. I used the voice control to pop corn and this morning to boil water for instant cappuccino without going into the kitchen,  saving three steps and a minute and a half. Using presets and sensor  settings with Alexa requires using the exact script in the manual p17. I would not know how to use all presets/sensor settings without Alexa, this is not in the manual I have, anywhere."
1,not a very good microwave.  The first issue is the stop button stopped working within a year and just recently it's running and there is no way to stop it.  Don't think I would purchase this brand of microwave anymore.
2,"Door latch assembly is substandard... quit working almost as soon as warranty expired. This is a common and known problem to panasonic...... would not recommend it. Parts not readily available, threw it away."
4,Average
3,The heating element is just for show.
1,"Don't like this microwave at all. Arrived w scratches in the enamel on the inside bottom surface. Suspect it would continue to scratch easily. Also had small piece of plastic broken off top of door. Inside cavity very small, esp height. Keypad is also very small and frustrating. Finally it's loud and sounds awful."
1,"I bought this because the price was right and I needed a temporary microwave. The microwave portion lasted about 2 months, while the air fryer and convection settings still work."
4,"My first Toshiba had a push button to open door. Over the years it started sticking. This model is great and highly improved with a door handle. Also, timing features are advanced with one button controls for timed elements. Makes a huge difference and well received improvement. And added more preprogrammed one button controls. E.g. potatoes, popcorn and liquid heat timing. Only been a week and still discovering more uses.Happy I purchased again., plus excellent price and delivery to door. Only big problem, glass tray inside will not stay on turntable. After every use need to reset glass tray. Why?"
2,"Aloha, I grabbed this microwave oven when my previous Hamilton Beach one died prematurely after about three years, since it was the same large size and relatively inexpensive at $115.  However, although the new Faberware oven cooks food adequately, its heat levels are wildly erratic and it often warps or otherwise damages even microwave-safe plastic plates and containers, a problem I never experienced with my previous oven.  I have to use a ceramic plate now when cooking high heat foods like french fries, which is an unnecessary hassle.  There's lots of different microwave brands available, and I will certainly never buy this one again after such a poor experience!"
4,"The product works great, and so far, I'm content with it."
4,"You get what you pay for, some plates will not fit in, not good for cooking turkeys. It's a little weak but if you need something to nuke food on a medium size plate it will work. 10 inch diameter plate fits perfectly but not any bigger"
5,We needed a small microwave to fit our counter and this one fit perfect.  Lots a features and at a extremely affordable price!
3,"The microwave cooks fine.But the mechanical action of the ""push button door"" requires very hard thumb force and holding the whole unit in place with the other hand to stop it moving.  The latch is also Loud.The mechanical action of the keypad buttons is also difficult, requiring hard pressure and sliding the thumb around on the label to find the exact spot that will produce a Beep. It always takes several tries.Hence overall good as an oven, but not easy or pleasant to use."
5,It isn’t bulky it’s just right for my apartment and I love it
1,This Microwave is just over a year old and for months it has been coming on by itself even with no time put on it. Dangerous
2,"Put in a TV dinner 2 minutes, still frozen in the middle ! Have to defrost first then cook ! May be good for heat up a drink or warm up a plate !"
1,The microwave oven and the package box are damaged badly when it arrived.
3,Air fryer and convection is off by about 75 or 100 degrees F.  I returned one and this second one is the same.  I follow the usage instructions exactly and the cooking instructions for the food exactly and I end up having to cook items for TWICE as long or longer.  Everything else is perfect.  I would NOT buy again.
4,Its small but I'm so happ with it and I'm an american girl for a little less it came I'm French besides it teaching me French its fun to learn thank u amazon
1,It started shorting out about 9 months after purchasing and got worse until it started making very scary noises at 1 year and became unusable.  Total waste of money.
3,"The NN-SN686S is exactly what it says it is, a microwave.  It is very powerful compared to our last microwave and is noticeable faster at heating.  The down side is it is loud and when we use it anyone on the other side of it from the wireless router loses access to the router (it must be kicking out one heck of an EM field).  So it works for us but we do not love it."
3,"This microwave has a very nice design and is easy to use. My only regret is that the push button to open the door doesn't work. You have to hold the microwave and manually open the door while pushing the button. Also, the microwave slides away while doing so because the pegs aren't non-slip. I probably would go with another microwave next time. This one is annoying."
4,Nice stainless microwave that is small and compact. Only 700 watts but still seems to heat everything fairly fast. Easy to use with pre programed buttons. Heats food nicely but the auto defrost was uneven and had some cooked spots on the meat. It is easy to clean and is very quite. Other than that it is a microwave.
2,Umm. Product is meh. I have to go out and buy another one. Its over priced if you ask me and it took forever to get here. But it works for now.
4,"I got this to use during recovery from surgery because my built in is far too high. It’s very pretty,  works just great but it is NOISY. Yes I have the turntable in correctly, yes, I have the other components in correctly. It sounds like a heavy glass container full of boiling water~all the time.Also, the beep is shrieky and long and it will not stop if you open the door. That’s annoying when you’re standing right there and open the door on the first beep and then you get FOUR more. It’s super annoying when you have parrots as well."
5,"Unfortunately, the first microwave shipped did not have the silencing feature even though the description said it did. However, the Amazon chat rep verified my complaint about the description, arranged the exchange, and this one is perfect! Especially for people with small spaces and who don't do much more than warm up a dinner plate in their microwave, it's a keeper."
5,Arrived quickly and in good condition.  Easy to set up and use.  Love the quick buttons as I'm always confused about how much time to set microwaves to reheat food.  It seems to know as it leftovers come out perfectly using this setting.  Takes out the guessing.  Does an excellent job heating.  Good quality.
1,"This brand new microwave started peeling on the inside after ONLY a few months of light use.  Then it started smelling during cooking, then died completely.  Just complete garbage product"
2,The magnetic turn style does not fit the turn turntable well and does not allow the table to turn properly.  It slid out of the mircrowave when it was opened and fell onto the floor breaking the turn table. Very unsatisfactory and could have been dangerous.
2,This microwave takes twice as long to cook as packaging instructions and our past normal Microwave. Buttons are also hard to press (they must be pressed very hard to respond).Only positive is that the Microwave looks nice.
5,Great purchase. Thought it was going to be a little bigger but the size was fine for me.
1,I had great expectations even after reading some reviews regarding the plate inside but boy that thing needs to get corrected if they want to continue selling these thing. It falls off the track every time I heat something up very frustrating. Heating is ok I only heat up small things and does its job. I would return it but I need a microwave and too much to have to research and check reviews for a better one. I do however love the way it looks but just wish they could fix the plate and track.Update 12/31/2020Today I used my microwave to heat up a cup of coffee and there was sparks and light as if it caught fire I opened the door and the side was all burnt. This microwave only lasted a year. Not great at all.
1,"I bought this 11/17 to have as a back up unit for my  other microwave.I never took it out of the box until tonight 2/28/20.Plugged it in expecting it to work, lights came on and the pad didn't work.no response at all.tried everything.useless."
4,Great little microwave for an office with usable power levels.  Works great.
3,I needed a microwave quickly and didnt want to spend a lot of $. This MW works and has the expected and intuitive controls. Its a great price and shipped quickly...but the loud noise eminating from the MW when in use makes the MW sound cheap in an otherwise nice kitchen.  This MW will be temporary and I will need to spend more $ on a higher-quality and much quieter version in the near future. Buyer beware.
2,The air fryer takes 20 or more minutes to cook vegetables that nornally take 12 to 15 minutes in other air fryers.  My food tasted like it was steamed instead of air fried.  Would not recommend this product for the air frying.
1,Did not last week.
5,Works very well. The controls are intuitive. Really enjoying how well it works and I haven’t even explored what it can do.
5,"We had to buy a new countertop microwave as our old one finally died.  After doing a lot of research on the best countertop microwaves, I went with the newer model of the one we had.  This model is so much better and the upgrades are very good.  The light inside is much better, if you have Alexa it can be programmed to it.  We don't have Alexa, but so far, we love it.  The ring at the end of the cycle is much improved and not nearly as annoying as the old one. The size is perfect and we have a family of 8.  I would definitely buy again and would recommend it to family and friends."
4,Works fine except some keys on touch pad work sporadically
3,Great for a beginner apartments.
5,"My overhead microwave has some kind of electrical issue and I needed some thing right away, because I make all our meals from home every day. And without a microwave, it was just adding a lot of steps to an already Long list of meal prepping. It came next day, I got it on sale, there was a 15 dollar coupon attached, which was especially great. Works wonderfully, I would recommend it."
1,"The day after I opened and setup the microwave, I noticed that there's a dent on the left side of it. I'm so disappointed!! I paid good money for this item and waited TWO WEEKS for it to be delivered, and this is what I get?!?! A damaged product?!? The box has already been thrown out and our old microwave that still worked is now gone too :("
5,Love it . No complaints about this product ..
4,"I needed a small microwave to fit on shelf, and this one is perfect. The dimensions in the description were accurate. It’s also very quiet."
5,Love the color and size for an apartment
4,Great product.
2,noise
5,My daughter's new apartment has a teensy tiny kitchen. Thos appliance is just right for tight spaces but it has ample cook capacity.
5,This is a nice size microwave. It does not take a lot of space of your counter.It works really fine.Great purchase.
3,greet for my small apartment not that powerful though takes 3 minutes to fully pop a bag of popcorn 😩
1,"when we opened the box - right on top,-- not even under any protection, was the glass turntable --BROKEN !!! --I don' want another, it probably will be broken also.  Also, I didn't want to go into the box because I didn't want to get cut with broken glass."
4,"I will admit that I had my doubts about an Alexa paired microwave.  The first reaction was, why do I need Alexa to start and stop the microwave?  If I have to put the food into the appliance anyway how much harder is it to hit some buttons to set the time?  Right?  Well, now that I have used the microwave for a few weeks I am a convert.  Having Alexa enabled and to be able to start/stop/re-heat by voice command only is great - especially if you are busy cooking dinner, cutting up vegetables, or have your hands full doing other stuff.  No, Alexa will not get the food for you but it is remarkably easy to just say, ""Alexa, microwave for 30 seconds"" or ""Alexa, microwave another 30 seconds,"" vice going over each time to push a series of buttons.  The microwave itself functions well.  I don't really use the sensor cooking much but it defrosts and heats well.  I also appreciate the door handle.  If there is one point of concern it is the hooks on the inside of the door.  They do appear to be made out of plastic so I am not sure how it will last over time.  As for the wifi pairing - whoooo - that was a pain.  However, once I used 5ghz it connected with ease.  Apparently, the frequently cited Eastern Time Zone clock setting issue has been resolved.  As of last week my clock does not switch over to a different TZ - fingers crossed.  If you need to buy a microwave anyway, this one is good."
5,"I bought this microwave for my dorm and it’s perfect; right size, colour, and works fantastic."
5,Bought as a present.  Our kids love the air fryer feature.  Very pleased with this purchase!
5,"Sharpe looking, easy to use and lots of room inside."
3,"I was trying to find a microwave that had the ability to silence the keypad and end notification beeps.This one is the opposite!  It has 5 loud beeps at the end and it reminds you like every 2 minutes, with 5 more beeps. I can't make it stop!"
1,"I really wanted to like this microwave. I do think the inverter cooks noticeably better.  After  the first one kicked me off a zoom meeting, I returned it and assumed it was faulty. However, after receiving the second one and it did the same thing, I did way to much research on microwaves and found out it's a faulty Faraday Cage with cheap design (put your phone in the microwave and give it a call). I don't care how safe leaking microwaves are with low risks to burns. It's not supposed to leak and my prior GE microwave didn't leak is why I'm returning it."
5,Very easy to work. Works very well. Special functions actually do what they say.
3,my wife ordered it for some reason instead of going into a store.. It will not fit a full size dinner plate but it works
4,"I'm lazy, i like to spam that +30 second button then adjust the power down for whatever I want to cook.this isn't possible :(SO I'm trying to learn how the sensor based cooking works ands occasionally working on the habit of pushing cook time first, then power, then start.Also some of the buttons are really tough to push, not sure if its an angle thing or just because my microwave is pretty new. Hope they break in a bit more.This microwave has great power but as it stands right now i'd tell my grandmother to get something easier."
3,Great looking microwave. Works well for that purpose. Was hoping the air fryer function would work so we could put our foodi ninja ait fryer away to save counter space. Turns out the air fryer function doesn't come close to the foodi. Air fried wings 3x the time and still wasn't as crispy.
3,"....the interior paint keeps peeling off. This is a great microwave, it is fast, has a large capacity, and there is a turntable. The only problem I have with it is that I must re-coat the inside every few months, or so. I've never had a microwave with such a flaky interior before. I used a smaller, lower wattage, Panasonic for 10 years without an once of trouble. I was hoping that I would experience the same vitality with this one, but noooo.Other that having to re-coat the interior, this is a fine microwave oven."
4,"Somewhat underpowered but a little better then the 10 year old GE one it replaced. About 1/2 the weight of old one. Same cubic feet as before but this newer one is slighly smaller. As others say control panel is a little hard to read. Unfortunately, this is only size that fits on counter without sticking out too far. If that's not an issue- go with a larger more powerful one."
1,It lasted 10 days then the motor burned.
5,"This microwave is easy to use, works well, and is attractive. The listed outer dimensions are accurate."
2,"The media could not be loaded.I bought this microwave about a year ago. My prior microwave was a Panasonic and lasted many years no problems. But this one worries me. The items get too hot and any packaging gets scorched when you follow the food label cooking times. I always reduce the time and watch it carefully or it burns the food. Example: small bag of popcorn, press popcorn button three times for 1.75. I always stop it when there is 25 sec left on the timer or it burns the popcorn and the bag is also scorched. Small single serving pizzas that call for 3 min, need only be cooked for 2 1/2 min or the pizza and box it sits on get scorched. From what I read, I’m not going to have any luck with Panasonic, but really this item should be recalled. Someone should look into it. Never walk away while anything is cooking. On the up side, heating water is super fast!"
5,Fit the small space perfectly.  Works well.
2,"The inverter defrost never really worked. It would partially defrost, but it also cooked the outside edges. After only a year it broke and stopped getting things hot. It stopped popping popcorn. It also won’t even heat a cup of coffee."
1,"i got this for the mute functionit does not mutei tried opening the door and holding the button like others have suggestedthat does not worka few weeks in, i tried to use some other functions, like change power levelsthat does not work, eitheri dunno if it's normal, but the thing just idling has been making a quiet buzzing noise, i hadn't noticed until a friend was over and mentioned itthis was a giant brick of a purchase for just a typical nuke machine, which i guess it works for that, at leastjust have to hope the buzzing isn't dangerous i guess"
1,"Microwave arrived with the door release not working. Unable to return as we live out of the country. We sent it to be fixed (cost $$) but it still keeps sticking. VERY disappointed in this product, it seems quality control is not up to standard because this could have easily been checked and noticed. I also went to the COUNTLESS great reviews it got. Unfortunately I seem to have gotten a lemon! Have to get rid of it. Already purchased a different one."
1,My previous microwave lasted for years. This one stopped working  in less than two years.
4,Best about Black and Decker is their products are worth the price. I got this on Cyber Monday and I will most likely have this for the next 20 years.
3,"The most salient feature of this microwave is that the microwave beam is either intense and poorly diffused in the oven, or is of an aggressive wavelength which dumps its energy quickly when it strikes moist food.  If you take thick Pace out of the fridge and try to heat it in a bowl, full power will have your food spitting superheated bits in less than 10 seconds---while the interior of the food remains ice cold.  This model requires very nuanced use of partial power, like down around .2 (which, of course, requires five times longer to cook).Light, attractive trim, quiet, suitable for a small apartment.  Not a good choice for owners who need to heat and run.  Despite the brand name, made in China.  Owners manual is in Japlish, but I could make it out."
5,Still haven’t had a chance to use all of the different elements of this but love having a single item on my counter that can accomplish them all
3,This thing holds odors any has to be cleaned after every use. Horrible smell. Threw it out. It stunk up my whole kitchen.  Took months to find a cleaner that only temporarily got rid of the smells.
4,"I do like the microwave but it is so noisy. I replaced a 30 year old Panasonic with this one and it is so much louder than my old one. The reviews said it was loud but I thought my hearing is not as good as it was so really, how bad could it be? Very bad. My other complaint is the control pad buttons are hard to push. In 30 years they couldn't have made it quieter and easy to push buttons? I don't know why it has to be this way if the technology was there many years ago. It could be a better product."
3,This microwave is great for Small spaces is easy to use. My only issue with it is that even if you heat something for two minutes it’s barely warm or hot like you have to do it for like additional time.
2,It rusted out inside within 6 months and I kept it clean and dry. The buttons on it are old school like a 1980's microwave in a 7-11
5,I bought this as a gift for my grandson who is renting his first apartment. He loves it!
3,Used for work to heat or re heat
4,Quick delivery
3,"I have had a rotational microwave set up for years, but it finally died. I have a specific size I need and this seemed right. My other microwave fit the same space, but was much larger inside. I was very disappointed to see how small this was inside, but I can live with that. The annoying part is that the ring that holds the glass rotating plate is so cheap and light that it comes off every time the plate is moved. And the connector from the plate to the microwave is too small for the plate, so it too comes off every time I lift what I was cooking off the rotational plate of the microwave. It also produces a lot of steam, so I am not sure how well the fan is working, if at all. I would NOT buy this again."
1,This product overheated and I had to unplug frompower source. It never worked after that. It worked a total of 10 days after it arrived and was put to use.
1,What most microwaves do in 30 seconds will have you waiting at least 3 min to heat up food to tepid. It's cute but that's it. You will have to keep putting food in more than once in order for it to reach a desired temp. DONT BUY not worth it. I have a super small space and opted to buy this to make better use of the counter but I wish I would've kept my old one now even though it was massive.
3,"This would have been a 5 star review if the app worked. The reason that I purchased this was to use it with my echo but the Toshiba App doesn't work at all for me. I can't log in or sign in after downloading it. It's pretty disappointing. That being said, the microwave is pretty nice. It's large inside without having a huge footprint. It's very powerful. My previous microwave was 900 watts and this blows it out of the water. It wipes out very easily so clean up is great but the exterior doesn't clean up as well. The microwave doesn't collect water in it. I had a microwave that got puddles of water in it due to condensation. This microwave is very good with venting, so I have had no issues like that at all. Finally, the clock and cook button are the same button so you always have to hit it twice if you want to cook something for less than 30 seconds. Pros: powerful, easy to clean, doesn't become wet inside. Cons: Cannot actually use with Alexa, exterior gets dirty quickly and doesn't clean as well as the inside, clock and cook button on the same button."
5,It works like a charm no problems and easy to use.
4,It works. The front looks fine. The sides are black - blech!
5,"We like the Panasonic micro because of its smaller size to fit on a counter under our cabinets. It replaces an 8 year old micro ( similar  model Panasonic) we use every day. The newer model is a little louder but cooks way more evenly and the addition 100 watts cooks things much faster than the old 1,100 watt machine. Our old one cooked the top part and the bottom of food was uncooked. This model heats evenly thru the food. Excellent micro"
4,"We originally ordered this item, but the one we first received didn't have the ""blue led"" feature as advertised, although the packaging suggested it did. The Amazon return process went as easy and smooth as usual (wish we didn't have to say that, but...) and we soon received a replacement which met the specification. Although customer service told us Amazon was going to de-list the item, it was still there when we checked. So far, the microwave is functioning satisfactorily, has good power and runs fairly quitely."
1,It was great until a few weeks ago it started blinking like the lights in a hospital hallway during a horror movie. Then yesterday it went out altogether and wont work at all. I took good care of this microwave. I covered my food always and wiped it out good with soap and water. i cook most of the time so we barely microwaved things anyway. I've never had a microwave do this. I've had much cheaper ones that are still running to this day in my old home and given to friends in need. This one didn't even last me a year and I'm sad about. :(
5,I love this microwave ! Looks super cute and works phenomenally! Buy buy
1,I researched this microwave and it was the top rated one against comparable units. This has hadissues on and off right from the beginning. It is one year old and only used sparingly by myelderly mother. Now it won't heat even a cup of water! Buyer beware - stay away from this microwave.I only gave it one star because it wouldn't allow me to put ZERO!!!!
5,"Over 36 years, we have only owned (now) 3 microwaves.  This one is the newer version of our last one, which served us well over many years.  Upgrades were a quieter closing door and a larger button to pop the door open.  It is basic (most frills are unnecessary on a microwave), cleans easily with the removable rotation plate, reasonably priced, and well-made."
3,I love the size of this microwave and it’s ease of use. I wish that it would heat better
1,"I paid over $200 only to have my fire alarm go off within the first five minutes of using this oven in air fryer mode. After some research, I realized that this is a very common issue that people experience with air fryers. It's something that manufacturers should clearly warn potential customers about. Without being able to use this function, this thing just isn't worth the money, so I'm considering returning it."
4,This is a good one. Takes a min or so to boot from no power. Cooks cake nice and everything else I have tried. 900w makes it faster than the 700W I have. The only problem was the control faceplate was broken off. I taped it back and it works. The packing was loose and the box was moving around inside the outside box. That may be why it broke. Lucked out and it works however.
3,"This size of this microwave was perfect for the space I needed. I do not like the power level. It seems I have heat my food for 4 minutes or longer. At 2 minutes just the outside of my food is heated. The middle is always cold. Even liquids that I take out the refrigerator to be heated, I have to start at 4 min"
3,Sounds like a rattling when it’s on. Also the plate doesn’t spin
4,may have cancelled the wrong protection plan withj Asurion.Bought a GE microwave today .Insurance plan was confusing
5,"Muy practico, buena calidad y a muy buen precio"
5,Compact microwave for my small kitchen. The price is perfect
5,THE INSIDE IS GRAY VERY NICE . RUNS QUITE . FITS IN SMALL SPACE .GOOD BUY .
2,"It was a gift for my daughter and fits perfectly into her very small kitchen. However, after a few uses it smokes inside when using. Not sure what the problem is yet..."
3,I loved this microwave when it was new!  A year later and the turn mechanism for the plate wobbles and makes all kinds of scary noises. I made sure it was level too. I’ve been using it without the turntable but nothing cooks properly.Looking for a new one today.
3,"I purchased this microwave in July 2021 (so about six months ago) and it works fine. A few things I've noticed though....first, it seems to really heat up whatever vessel the food is in, like SCALDING hot, but yet the food will stay cold. I don't recall ever having this issue with other microwaves, so I feel like I need to reheat things longer and stop/stir along the way. Maybe that's the inverter technology at work. Second, and I never realized it would annoy me, but there is no auto-start option. Every microwave I've had over the years, if you hit 1-4 it would automatically turn on for 1-4 minutes. It's a little convenience that I miss. Finally, and this is the big one, the plastic over the keypad is already bubbling in a couple places (on the 0 and Start buttons). At first I thought it was dirt, but nope. Overall I think I could've gotten a less expensive microwave that would've done the job just as well."
3,Rotating plate motor very noisy.  Smart sensor instructions very small. Food does get hot.  I prefer to use timer rather than sensor to cook. Front option panel crowded.
2,"This microwave is cute but it does not heat up food well and it is not intuitive (everyone who has used it at my house is like ""WTF? how do you do this!"".  For example - there is not a keypad with numbers (see photo) to enter a time/length for cooking, there are no levels available (low/high).  It is great for popcorn, but meat or anything that is cold takes forever to heat up.  Lastly, the rotating plate inside of the microwave always comes off of track and stops rotating! I think it was poorly designed but again, it is super cute! I advise you to check it out in detail before purchasing - it works for me and I will rock with it until it stops working completely but I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it to anyone else."
5,"works great, matches our other stainless steel appliances, and runs quietly.  I'd definitely purchase again."
4,"it fit the same place as my last one.  no bells and whistles, but i don't have to worry about old house wiring (15amp).  It still looks new..  It pops the popcorn, boils the water and cooks my breakfast sausage.  the glass plate it rotates on.. can be knocked off it's free moving bearing ring but does not come off unless knocked off.  It has never come off while cooking.  but when cleaning the plate from overflows and boil overs you have to re set the bearing ring.. and mess with the glass plate to re-seat it.  minor irritation not a major problem.  Still a lot of features i haven't used.. cus i'm a plug and play type.. but i'm happy with the purchase.  It was this cheap small footprint low watt or a monster microwave with all the whistles.  i went for the size..  no regrets."
2,"Nice, compact microwave BUT… it didn’t even last 8 months! It sputtered, smoked and flashed and…done."
5,Liked the quick shipment. Perfect condition
5,"Used colored electrical tape to mark keys that are actually used.  Note:  The numerical keypad is only used for entering cooking time.  This unit replaced a similar large 17 year old GE microwave.  There is a learning curve switching from GE to Panasonic.  The Panasonic keys are hard to read for a senior citizen.  Frustrating at first, color coding the keys really helped."
3,It looks nice and the led light is bright inside. A few issues I have with it. You can not just hit a time and then go like a normal microwave. You have to actually hit “ time cook” first and then type your selected time. If you just start hitting numbers it will just start off at the number of minutes. So if you hit “1 and then 2” as if you were going to cook for one minute and twenty seconds it just comes on and cooks for two minutes. Also the stop button is on the bottom right hand corner and the start is on the bottom left. That is backwards from any microwave I have ever owned. Seems insignificant but it’s annoying. Also after around a months use I could start to feel a bad spot in the plastic covering  of the buttons in the “start” button of course it is probably the most used button. Now it has spread and there are multiple places were the plastic is coming up. Very disappointing with a unit that has been used maybe three months. My old microwave was still working but just heating unevenly and nothing like that had happened and it was probably 20 years old.*edit*  I picked at the bubbled up part and it is in fact a sticker. But there were no clear edges to indicate it should be peeled off. But the keypad issue is no longer one once the film was removed. Although I feel a little dumb for not doing that earlier. It should have a tab or a lip so it’s easy to see it should be removed imo.
3,Good size good look
5,Sleek and classy looking in her kitchen. She loves it!!!
2,"I am not very happy with this Panasonic Microwave Oven NN-SN686S .I don't really use it for more than thawing frozen foods, reheating foods, popping bagged popcorn and zapping potatoes. So far that has been good. I'm unhappy with other things. The viewing screen on the door is way too short. You just can't see if your liquids are boiling or not. The inside light is not bright enough and it is located toward the front behind a perforated metaal screen but too close to the non perforated section and that blocks a lot of the light from the back of the compartment. When you remove a large bowl (or whatever) from the carousel, and you drag a liottle bit of the weight across the carousel plate table, it will come off it's wheeled locator track and you have to fiddle around with them to properly re-align them. My biggest complaint is that the control panel does not light up. I am a night owl and have to turn on the kitchen lights to read the panel. Sorry I can't comment on the rest of the cooking operations."
5,"My wife calls this Chefman 1.3-cubic-foot, 1000-Watt microwave “cute” because it is smaller than our 2.0-cubic-foot microwave that we were previously using.  Being smaller, it definitely made room on the top shelf of our baker’s rack to be able to put more things next to it, like our electric kettle, which is in a much more convenient spot now.Our family mainly uses the microwave to warm up leftovers, and I use it to warm up my cold coffee all the time.  This microwave has tons of extra features that I don’t think I’ll ever use, but just having the options is pretty impressive to me.  I’ll try using the beverage button to warm up my coffee instead of hitting the +30 second button, which I think is the most used button on the microwave, and see if that heats my coffee without it overheating it so I don’t burn my tongue.Well, I tried out the beverage button, and I’ll stick with the +30 second button as it heated my coffee way too hot where I’d easily burn my tongue.  I had to let my coffee cool down for a good ten minutes before I could even take a sip.There are six auto menus to choose from:  popcorn, potato, pizza, veggies, beverages, and leftovers, and 10 power levels so you can set it between PL 1 to PL 5 to defrost, and up to PL 10 so you can have your food or beverage boiling like my coffee!Another feature which I thought was really cool is that the microwave has a mute button where you can turn off the sound if you prefer not to have the microwave beep when your food is done or when you’re pressing buttons.  Wished our other microwave had this feature.My daughter uses the timer button often to make sure that she doesn’t overcook her ramen noodles, and I especially like that the microwave is energy efficient and will shut down the LED display when not in use.This is a great microwave that does the job for my family, and so far, we don’t have any complaints.Only time will tell if this Chefman microwave can hold up to my family's microwave heavy usage.I can currently recommend it."
1,"Bought this microwave during covid lockdown. It never has popped a bag of popcorn, takes a long time to warm a beverage, it just exploded a glass mug. Doesn't heat food well, takes forever. The dish will come out blistering hot and the food will be cold. Safety hazard to say the least.I will never buy a microwave from amazon ever again."
3,"This is not stackable with the ""matching"" toaster oven"
2,"Though we were very pleased with this, we have already had to replace the pad inside the microwave as it developed a burn hole and now it has peeling paint on the inside. We purchased 18 months ago.  Very disappointed and do not recommend."
1,The media could not be loaded.Steam visible on microwave door after a few months of purchasing it. I contacted Panasonic and they recommended for one of their technician to come out at a cost.Should be no star review.
2,Doesn’t heat well at all popcorn doesn’t even get cooked with the preset unless you are only heating cups of water save your money
4,I ordered this for my son because his microwave broke.  They said they like it.
5,"Been in use for a month without problems.  It's VERY powerful, so watch the cooking time you set.  Highly recommended."
5,Easy to use Microwave! Perfect apartment size.
3,"The functions were exactly what we were looking for. Overall the unit just felt cheap.  Seemed to operate great in microwave - air fry not even close, like a high temp bake. Disappointing. Personally I hate button openers - a handle makes a huge difference."
5,It works well!
3,"The media could not be loaded.Beautiful microwave. Should have listened to the other reviews about it being loud. But, it technically doesn’t affect the performance, so I am just going to keep it. Hopefully it lasts for a long time. We will see I guess. The controls are clear, power is good, it was a bit heavy, but other than the annoying loud sound, it just what I needed."
5,I bought this for my husband's semi. It fit just right in the space allowed for it. Haven't used it yet.
4,"This is a good little microwave. It looks nice (fully stainless instead of just on the front) and does its job. Cons - no ""quick minute"" or ""add 30 seconds"" button. This means you actually have to type in ""1:00, start,"" etc. which is slightly inconvenient. Also, note it's a very small microwave, only fitting a standard-sized plate and certainly not a larger tupperware or anything like that. For my purposes, it works well though."
4,"The unit has a clean look and has been working well.  The control panel isn't backlit and the writing has low contrast so we are adding a motion control light to the cabinet to see which buttons we are pushing!  The display panel doesn't show all the information it could.  For example, the popcorn button displays options 1, 2, or 3 but could display the bag size they designate - either sm, md, lg or the number of ounces.  The automatic cooking options 1 through 14 and the defrost options require either good memorization or a handy copy of the page from the manual."
1,"This has been a decent microwave oven until it lasted. It is not powerful, but you get used to it. The reason for the one star review is longevity of the product. It died exactly two months after the 2 year warranty expired. I was expecting more from Black & Decker. Now when I turn the microwave on, there is flame inside, very scary noise and burnt electric smell. So it goes to the garbage, but was good during its short lifespan of 2 years and 2 months of service,"
2,"Like most microwave ovens, it has an overall cheap feel, materials are marginal at best, even at this price point so I'm mostly underwhelmed. Looks nicer than most, works ok more or less. Our units door does not line up exactly with the rest of the trim on the right side, if I try and push the door up on right side it turns on the microwave for no apparent reason. Came with a dent on the side, although the box itself was not damaged when received, hmmm. I'm keeping the box just in case something else happens."
4,Overall great product.  Air fryer is a huge plus and helps remove an appliance off counters.  Microwave functions are simple and to the point.  The instructions on how to use convection oven are non existent.  Air fryer has a 1 page add in.  We figured it out.  Just leaves a lot to be desired and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.  It matches our other GE products.
4,The microwave seems to operate fine but the LED light appears to be very dim.  The inside of the microwave is gray which does not help with the brightness of the lighting.  It also appears to be very tinny which I might have some concern over.
1,"I rarely review things, but I thought this was important. We've had it for a little over a year. It feels under powered, but it's a small inexpensive microwave so whatever. Last week I was using it to reheat some leftovers and it started to smoke inside. There was nothing metal in there. It just suddenly started to vent smoke. Please be careful and DO NOT BUY."
2,"Size-wise, it is a lot smaller than a full-size. Only 4"" but turntable size (shown) difference is huge! Power difference (900W vs 1100W) does not appear to be significant but it takes approximately 20-25% longer to cook *anything* compared to my 25 year old Panasonic full-size. With today's chip programming, you'd think they could improve multi-stage cooking to more than 2 (consecutive) stages! Even the 25 yr old Panasonic allows a 'timer' stage between the two stages allowing for stirring, flipping, etc. instead of going directly from 1st to 2nd stage cooking! Overall, not bad for the occasional quick snack but for regular use, opt for a full-size, full power oven instead."
1,"Worked OK for 2.5 years being lightly used most days and then, today, just stopped heating. Loved the look of it but 2.5 years is a joke even with today's shoddy appliance quality!"
3,I bought this here on Amazon and after a delay in shipping I finally received it.The problem is that the installation instructions are in Spanish.  No English manual was included.I went to Black & Decker's customer support page and requested a copy in English.Once I've received that and have been able to successfully install and use the microwave I will update my review.
4,Good value for the money. When timed cook is finished bell dings 5 times and there is no way to turn it off even after opening the door.Door will not stay fully open when removing a dish. Have to be careful that door doesn’t interfere when removing a dish.Cooking times and temps are accurate.
1,"Item came in with defects and not working at all.  The lights won’t go off even if you close the cover, there is a dent near the open button and the start won’t work at all.  Such a waste of money, time and effort.  Refund never received to my original payment used, checked the bank after 3-5 business days but nothing still after a few weeks.  BEWARE!!!"
1,After 3 years we had to replace the unit because of extensive rust.  Otherwise it was fine.
3,"I would not buy this machine again. The turntable is the loudest I've ever experienced & can be a little jerky at times. We replaced an older Panasonic that we loved and paid 1/2 the price for. This one is definitely cheaper quality construction, but that's the way of the world these days. The ""Sensor Reheat"" which we used constantly on the old one is just absolutely horrible on this new machine. Basically unusable. However, the power level is easier to maneuver, so we have changed to that as a kind of manual reheat option. Just get the 100-120 dollar machine & go with that over paying so much for this one. You don't always get what you pay for."
3,Work properly but not as expected. The sized of the microwave were perfect to what I need however it's not strong enough. It take more then usual to defrost and it;s getting annoying
4,"I wanted a smaller microwave with a lower wattage output.  My current one is used mostly for reheating and defrosting. This is a nice microwave. It is more compact and that's important for my small kitchen.  I like the way the defrosting works in this microwave. No more dried-out food. With 1000 watts of power this one heats food quickly. I tried reheating centering the food in the center of the microwave and slightly off center. I find that off-center reheats more efficiently. I can still use my same microwave food covers to reduce splatter. It is easy to clean and it is quiet for the most part. So far so good, I haven't had any issues using it."
3,"The steam from food keeps fogging up the window, even though I have the unit’s vents spaced away from all surfaces by at least an inch or more."
1,"For 80 dollars it’s not warming up foods to the instructions. You have to keep warming up. Forget about popcorn - only half will pop.Quality is poor.Also, it’s TIny!"
4,"Don’t get me wrong, it works great. But it’s not standard size. It’s perfect for a dorm room. Not house."
5,"This is a great microwave for countertop use, although it is large.  It comes right to the edge of my counter, and fills the space below the cabinet almost completely.  It is powerful, at 1200 watts, so it cooks slightly faster than most units, and for the price I recommend it.The interior of the unit isn't cluttered with little bumps and rivets, which makes cleaning easy.  One thing to keep in mind for cleaning is that the rotating glass platter is large.  You can almost fit two serving plates side by side.  It may not fit in a dishwasher, it's that big.There are only a few things to keep in mind.  Firstly, almost everything about this is loud.  The door mechanism, both opening and closing, is loud.  The beeps on the keypad are loud.  The beeps at the end of cooking are loud, and annoyingly don't stop when you open the door.Secondly, the sensor reheat is overall pretty good.  It is basically a steam sensor, so you have to take into account the type of item you're cooking, but I find that it works a bit better if covered with a paper towel for most items.  If you don't do this, you may have to take it out, stir and then put it back in for 30 seconds or so.Lastly, and I'm not even sure if this is a complaint, the Quick 30 Seconds button doesn't automatically start the unit.  You need to push Quick 30 and then start.  This is different from my last unit (a GE model), and I liked that function.  Now it's only real use is to add time to an already started cook.  Still very useful, but it stands out because of how often I would use the feature to add time and start the unit with one button."
4,"Love the inverter auto cook button.  Can place any cold item for warm up on this cycle and it comes out hot and not over or undercooked or warm.  Unit is light weight, oven well lit.  However, the display is in need of an overhaul.  The display can barely be seen.  The numbers and cycle pad also difficult to see ( not just because I use 70 yo eyes--my grandkids say hard to see also).  So, other than the display pad, I have no complaints."
1,"Good for small spaces, easy to use but not worth the price :("
1,REF
3,Hard to see settings
4,"I bought this in March 2017 and used it daily, multiple times per day. It still works well, but I just noticed the ceiling inside the microwave is starting to rust and the paint is starting to flake, and when you open or close the door, paint and rust crumbles onto your food. So this lasted about 6 and a half years of daily use, which I think is pretty reasonable for a 70$ microwave."
4,"This is a small microwave but is exactly what I was looking for. I use it mainly to reheat or defrost food. It is fairly quiet, takes up a minimal amount of counter space and is attractive. It was also a very good price. I find it easy to use and so far it works well. However, if you are looking for something that does more than reheat food I suggest you go for a more powerful model."
2,"The clock has a light, but the key pad does not.  The lack of a lit keypad combined with low contrast printing on the menu makes this oven very inconvenient to use unless it is in a location that is always well lit. In addition, the keypad selections require a very firm ""push"".  We have also found the menu structure to be confusing and awkward, but that may be a matter of preference.  The oven seems to work fine and is quiet in operation, but the lack of a well designed and well lit keypad is a serious defect that earned this oven a low rating."
5,"I recieved my microwave on January 05, 2022 and in the time I've had it thus far, I have had no issues with it. It's easy to clean. It may seem small but don't let that waver you, it fits everything. The wattage does suck though. Often times I have to double the cook time for certain things to make sure it's heated properly but other than that, I love it. I highly recommend this product. It's surprisingly amazing for it's cheap price! I payed between $90 and $95 for it. For the price, it's better than expected."
4,"A little surprised at how long the air fryer takes to work. Haven't tried anything like wings, just frozen fries and it takes roughly twice as long as the conventional oven."
1,"I bought this as an open box customer return. It was rated Like New by Amazon.5 weeks after installation, it failed. (The light would come on, the table would spin, and the counter did the countdown properly - BUT no heating at all.So I reached out to Toshiba for warranty service. After several days of wasted time, I was contacted and told that they considered the item to be USED and was not covered by any Toshiba warranty. No partial credit - nothing...(Happily, Amazon made good on the failure, but be warned. If you buy refurbished Toshiba products, do it knowing they will not be there to warrant them.)As far as the oven itself, when it worked it worked OK. Nothing special. We did find the user interface to be rather awkward. (As a retired engineer, I cannot see much human factor work paid to this model.)"
5,"Our previous Microwave broke. We wanted one about the same size, but we really liked this one, including the price! We were pleasantly surprised when we got it and discovered that although it is smaller than our original, it is the same size on the inside! Yay!! As for the performance, it is terrific. I mostly use the microwave, but my husband likes the convection part. He uses it to avoid turning on the large oven in the Texas heat. He has cooked steak, pork chops, chicken, and more in it. Wiping it down after he cooks all this meat has been really easy too. No scrubbing is needed, just a cloth to wipe it. We love this microwave and highly recommend it."
5,Compact and easy to slide down the counter. Not bulky at all. Easy to clean and gets food hot quickly. Really pleased
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED
3,I’ve had the microwave just over two years and it stopped working. Thought it would have a much longer shelf life.
1,"First one smelled like burning plastic chemicals, at the end of the first week it caught fire.  Second one quit on the third use.  My wife like the looks of it though.  Returned both and bought another brand."
1,The Comfee worked great with daily use for 7 months. It just crapped out today. It no longer heats on the inside but boy the outside is hotter than he'll.Don't buy one without an additional Amazon warranty. I wish I had.
3,"For a ""smart"" microwave, it's not very smart. The clock keeps resetting and I have to keep changing it every time the microwave decides to just shut itself off. The microwave itself keeps becoming unresponsive with the Alexa app, requiring me to readd it. Alexa also for whatever reason picks up two microwaves instead of just the one. The Alexa integration itself is more of a gimmick then anything, other than saying ""microwave for X minutes"" there's not much else it does, making Alexa kind of not really taken advantage of in this instance.The microwave is also fairly big. Takes up a lot of space. I got this just for the Alexa ability and I'm not really impressed by it. It's a cool feature to show your friends, that's about it."
3,Too much condensation inside after cooking. Top got pretty hot after cooking for a long time.
5,"We chose this product because our counters are not very big. This size fits well. Also, 4 functions were enough for our needs. We have cooked everything from fish, to pizzas, potatoes, veggies, and just about everything a person eats in this machine. My wife even does gluten free bread in microwave mode😮. Yeah, go figure! And it all turns out great. And, at this price, it was a bargain. Our previous GE microwave (only) was 19 years old and still going strong. 100% pleased🤩"
2,Unfortunately the microwave pictured is not what I received. The door is black. This is the kind of item that is too much of a pain to return so I am now stuck with it. Very deceptive.
5,It's a good microwave.
4,Almost too small. A bag of microwave popcorn was done but the turntable had to be “off”. Soup? Beverage?  No problem.
2,There was not a booklet or list of insstructions.
3,Had this microwave over a year and it’s been decent; served it’s purpose but the paint is beginning to peel away inside the microwave.
3,Turntable wobbles a bit and a little more noisy than the last microwave we had. Not a deal breaker.
3,"The wattage is low (700) and takes a little more time. It works well overall, but I don’t like how easily the round glass plate becomes loose and could easily fall and break if you’re not careful. It doesn’t fit well."
1,"FOR ONE THING CANNOT SEE THE ITEM ON THE TURNTABLE THRU THE WINDOW WHEN USING. GOT IT LAST FRIDAY USED SATURDAY AND TRIED TO USE IT TODAY SUNDAY, WILL NOT WORK.  FIXED THE MICROWAVE BY PUTTING IT IN THE TRASH.  A WHOLE ONE DAY TO USE IT AND IT ONLY COST ME OVER $100 WHAT A DEAL. I WILL NOW BUY SOMETHING ELSE."
2,"Purchased new, larger and much higher quality Toshiba just 6 months later due to dissatisfaction with this one. Keypad becoming obscured. Operation not entirely reliable. Moves too easily on counter from key presses. Relative lower cost of this unit certainly does not translate to higher value."
2,"This is a tiny, low-powered microwave, which I was expecting.  I wasn't expecting the paint to start bubbling and peeling within a couple of months, and for the inside to start to rust along the edges.  I've had it for a year and a half now, the the paint is  bubbled and peeling on the top and bottom, and is scraped off where the wheels are for the dish.  It's impossible to clean now, and I plan to replace it.  This was not a good purchase."
5,"Microwave works as expected and also looks aesthetically pleasing. The design looks nice in my kitchen and matched many other of my stainless steel or black appliances. It works well and fits in the space I need. My family prefers a more compact, or smaller, microwave to fit better on the counter and take up less space. After my previous microwave died, I was in the market for another since I like to use one somewhat often. At first, I made the mistake of buying a microwave from cheaper brand. It was a dud, and I returned it the next day. Once I had my refund, I decided to do more proper research instead of just picking the first deal I came across. I turned to Google for research -- like most people do, and I saw this microwave on several different lists which complied the best compact microwaves of 2021/2022 and decided to purchase it. I am happy with my decision thus far."
4,"This microwave has good power and heats faster than my prior one. I do find it is noisier than my old one, which is okay, though. I find the touch pad sometimes does not respond to an even firm push and I am not use to that and find it irritating. It takes too many pushes of the touch pad to use the power levels andthen, with the touch pad not functioning with a light touch...sometimes I have to push several times for it to  kick in...I get very frustrated. I do not have the time or patience to be trying to get these electronic appliances to work. My husband likes this microwave, but he is not the primary user, I am. He likes that it heats up his leftovers faster than the prior one. The microwaves, when we purchased this one, seemed to not be in stock...maybe because of the shortage of microchips needed to produce the products. So, we were limited on what was available."
3,Liked air fryer but it took 4 minutes to heat my coffee.  Way to long!
4,"This is a very solid microwave at a great price point for the performance it give. Perfect for an apartment or small home. All of the basic to mid-range features you expect are here including a bunch of pre-set modes, memory functions, and a decent size relative to price. Every function of this microwave that I tested worked as expected; I used the defrost, popcorn, and frozen vegetable settings most frequently and they all performed well. Controls are intuitive and easy to learn. Noise level is normal for a microwave of this size."
2,"highlight was beepless optionTurntable never fit, quit after just two years,"
5,"For those of us who can’t afford the current kitchen trends or a remodel, this sits on a cheap contractor built shelf in our kitchen. Which means there is nothing high end about this model. It’s nice looking, and functional.The factory information says to allow 12 inches above, and 3 inches around for the vents to work properly. We have 3 inches above and around. It’s use will be basic family use such as reheat, soften and melt, popcorn, etc.  It had a metallic “new” smell so I boiled some water and let it steam, and it’s much better. The husband thinks pushing two buttons before start is too many.  He doesn’t like change, but admits it’s quiet, and it doesn’t move around on the shelf when opening and closing.  I think the buttons are easy to read. So far it has not interfered with our fiber optics, phones etc. We have had that problem with other models over the years. We chose a handle style rather than push button. Our former microwave push button door had to be slammed for the door to shut. This is nice and smooth.The husband says 4 stars, and I think 5. Will update if needed as time goes on."
4,"Was replacing a 15 year old microwave that still looked like new, but quit working. This Panasonic has a slippery touchpad that isn't quite sensitive enough. I have to press hard to get it to recognize my input. And also disappointed with how many ""clicks"" to get the thing running. My old microwave started using the preset controls (boiling water, one click; 30 second, one click), this one forces me to press Start after every other button (boiling water, two clicks). And if you stir half-way through, you can't add more time without pressing ""Add time"" or ""Reset"" first. And it's much louder than my old one, even the kids noticed."
5,"I needed a small, simple microwave to melt butter and defrost homemade soups. This one is great.I think the interface is better than average. Once you understand the logic, it’s simple and intuitive. Same with the touchy buttons. The turntable rattled the first time I used it, but I flipped over the wheel and now it’s silent.The only think I don’t like - and I’m already getting used to it - is the loud, hollow, clunky noise the door makes when I close it. I’m concerned that the plastic latch may break before the microwaves dies. C’est la vie. This is a small, inexpensive microwave and I'm happy."
1,"...then one day made an small explosion, lots of smoke and it got deformed inside, on the right side. Glad Amazon refunded me even when the return window was closed. Don't know if i received a defective one, or if this model of Microwave Oven is just bad. I can't recommend it."
1,Product did not work
4,"Easy to use, button shortcuts are okay, sometimes they are annoying. The Popcorn button could use some tweaks to the time, but overall it's a great replacement to my broken one."
5,"This microwave is the perfect size for my microwave shelf which leaves more countertop space. It easily accommodates a full size diner plate. Touch button control allows for easy cleaning,"
4,"Pros: It is attractive, compact, efficient with a lot of the bells and whistles.Cons: the buttons are hard to press and when your hands are full and you're in a hurry that can be aggravating. The rotating tray is flaky and doesn't just snap in place but instead floats and can get on your nerve sliding around in there. This is low wattage so be patient and give yourself a couple extra minutes to heat your food as opposed to your old, big, high-wattage-monster-zapping microwave."
2,The interior starting smelling like rotten garbage after a while. Have had to discontinue use.
5,"We have a built in microwave but saw this one to use as a backup. I was amazed to find that it holds and heats 90% of the items that we put into our oriinal one. So basically if you are not using this as part of a heating process for a large meal, it is perfect. Hotdogs, single soups, reheating coffee.... it all works well. The unit is quiet enough and so far seems to work well. It was packaged nicely in full foam with plastic cover over the unit."
3,It's been a while since I bought it. It feels OK. Everything is fine. It heats up very quickly. It's very convenient. I use it every day. Big brands are reliable after all. But. There are some things I don't like. It's very loud when you use it. It's a lot louder than the microwave I used to use. Especially at night. It's even more obvious. The bad part. Or is it inconvenient to clean. It's a little more trouble than your average microwave oven. Hope to improve
5,"Had it about three months. So far, so good."
1,This appliance NEVER got hot; a piece of junk.
3,"I used to have a microwave made by Sharp and it lasted over 25 years. This Black and Decker lasted just short of two years. Maybe Black and Decker make nice tools but not microwaves? I think the motor died because it grinds and I see zaps that can light up a dark room. So, it is not safe to use anymore. When it worked it was fine, it was nothing spectacular, but fine. It was inexpensive so I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Great microwave. DISLIKE TINTED GLASS ON DOOR! I can't see inside while heating food.Cheese gets over melted.
1,The inner top surface of the cooking area shows holes and degraded areas; probably some material feel into food while cooking. I just discovered this problem and have contacted the Consumer Protection Agency. I am also seeking out other legal resources.
5,I use this oven for home use mostly to heat my dinner not for cooking ... It's new to me yet so can't really tell what it can do because I don't know myself yet ...
1,"Phone # shown transfers to another line, then got a hang-up response.  Website experience asked what was the problems and then wants payment for a tech to help!"
4,I had to use a magnifying glass to read labels on the front.
5,"Little smaller than I thought, but it still has great power for it's size. Still high enough to put in my items to be heated. Would have loved it to be a little bigger, but that was my fault."
3,Bought this on February 24 2021 and it already crapped out. Electrical smell.
3,Good price/value ratio
1,"The microwave itself is decent. It microwaves. Not super powerful. Usually a minute is good enough to heat a cup of tea, but this model requires a little more time. My biggest gripe and source of disappointment is missing parts. First, the glass turntable which I had Amazon credit applied to my account, then the part sent. It fit. But wait, the rotating arm wasn't included, so I had to get the credit and order another part. I should have returned this product to begin with and saved myself so much frustration and TIME! Customer service did what they could, but this model which I bough because of wirecutter.com reviews is NOT worth this must hassle. Just go to Walmart and buy whatever is cheapest. I might end up returning this anyway."
1,"I liked the size and the look but the alexa integration is horrible. All those pictures about ""Alexa, microwave 2.75 oz of popcorn"" are lies. The only command that works is ""Alexa, microwave x minutes"". You can't even change the power level by voice.After coming off DST, the clock refused to change. You could manually change it but after a bit, it would change back. I refuse to fight with an appliance over what time it is. Going back and tired of false advertising.Update: Tried a little longer to get this to work. Now, within seconds of connecting it to wifi, it drops the connection and you can't even use the app to control it. I have talked to toshiba tech support and all you get is they will submit a ticket, someone will get in touch with you, but they never do. Toshiba used to be a good brand, now they are a good brand to avoid. Should have saved the frustration and just returned it sooner. Thank goodness for extended holiday returns."
3,"It's a good size, looks great but too noisy when running. Expected better technology in such a new appliance"
3,"For the past 15+ years, my Kenmore microwave has been serving me faithfully. The other day it stopped heating. After a brief minute of mourning, I went online to research new microwaves and realized that finding all the features I want in a new microwave was going to be impossible. So I narrowed down all the choices available and settled on this particular Farberware model. My three main concerns with buying a new microwave were heating/power, noise, and longevity. This is what I observed with the Farberware:--NOISE LEVEL: Very acceptable -- Compared to my trusty Kenmore, this microwave is noticeably quieter. On some microwaves (especially older ones) the humming noise of the magnetron is masked by the even-louder noise of the cooling fans. On this microwave, however, the fans are so quiet that you can hear the magnetron humming.POWER: Excellent... at first. My old Kenmore was also 1,100 watts, but I could tell it weakened to the equivalent of about 1,000 watts over time. I therefore expected the Farberware to outperform my old Kenmore in heating up an entree, and that's exactly what it did... for the first few months. Then the power level decreased. The Farberware is now operating at the same power level as my time-weakened Kenmore.LONGEVITY: Obviously I can't comment on that since I just bought the microwave, but if craps out within the next few years, I will update this review and adjust my rating accordingly.--POSITIVE REMARKS:The Express Cook feature is a very handy and suitable replacement for the ""Add Minute"" button on my old Kenmore, which is the button I used the most. I expect to use Express Cook a lot — one minute for my morning oatmeal, and four minutes for my frozen entrees.The lighting inside the microwave is very different from the incandescent bulb illuminating the white interior I'm used to, but it works surprisingly well. I wanted to dislike it, but I can't. There's something about the LED light and the dark gray interior that makes the food particularly easy to see while its cooking.The clock/timer display is just the right brightness. Some reviews complain about the display wigging out, but I've noticed those reviews also show an older blue LED display. Perhaps the green display is a new update that fixes those issues?--INDIFFERENT REMARKS:When the food is done, the microwave beeps five times. The beeping is only a tiny bit louder/more annoying than my old Kenmore.The door makes a clunk when you close it, but the clunk is only slightly louder than my old Kenmore. It doesn't bother me.I have no opinion on the griller function because I have no plans to use it.--NEGATIVE REMARKS:There's an inconvenience built into the Express Cook's design you may want to be aware of... buttons 7, 8, and 9, by default, are disabled. In order to enable those buttons, you'll first need to press the Time Cook button. So if you have pets and were hoping for a quick 7 or 8 seconds to warm up their food, you'll need to hit the START button to give the microwave 30 seconds and then manually shut the microwave off after 7 or 8 seconds. Not a deal breaker, but the engineers who disabled those numbers on the keypad clearly never owned a cat.The keypad would be asier to see in dimmer light if the printed legends were white instead of tan.A lot of steam builds up inside this microwave. My old Kenmore never did that, so I'm not sure if it's a bad thing or a good thing, but it can make the food harder to see.The keypad buttons are not as as soft as my old Kenmore. They require a slightly harder press with more pinpoint fingertip accuracy. Again, not a deal breaker, but I often find myself holding the right side of the microwave with my fingers and using my thumb to press the buttons to help prevent the microwave from sliding back on my countertop.When the microwave shuts off and the beeping starts, you can't stop the beeping by pressing the STOP button. In fact, all microwave functions are disabled until the beeping stops.If you use one of the preset buttons, like Popcorn, you can't add more time while the microwave is running. If corn is still popping when the microwave is about to shut off, you can't just press START to keep the microwave running. The best you can do is quickly hit STOP twice right around the 00:01 second mark and then hit START."
5,Microwave works great. Well worth the money
4,"The size is a bit smaller and less ""stainless steel"" looking than I thought but I should have paid more attention to the description.  I was convinced to buy this because it allows you to turn off the beeping.  As a noise sensitive person, I appreciate that the sound can be turned off.  I did have to read the directions to figure out how to turn it off because it wasn't intuitive.  You have to hold down the button for 3 seconds until the tone sounds and the sound is turned off.  I think it's fantastic while I'm sure other users would prefer the sound notification.  You can always turn it back on.  :-)"
2,"First impressions are not great.  We'll be keeping it because my girl wants to keep it, so hopefully over time this microwave oven will grow on me.1. Cannot interrupt 'done' beeping -  Why does this alert need to keep going after the door is opened?  It does not, but due to bad/lazy programming, here we are (sometimes you want to use the microwave QUIETLY)2.  No Backlit buttons - I thought maybe two hundred dollars would be enough to have backlit buttons, but no.  Instead we get a machine designed in 1993 by engineers sitting in bright fluorescent rooms, unable or unwilling to comprehend that people don't always want or need all those lights on.  Get ready to turn on those lights!3. Terrible control panel color contrast - the color scheme here is best described as ""silver on chrome"", which may sound ridiculous, and that's because it is.  Very difficult to see even in daylight hours.  Basic UI design dictates an acceptable level of color contrast for text but these principles were cast aside in the name of aesthetics.4. Loud - louder than the old one.  I did not subtract stars for this because personally I don't really care, but be aware.So all in all, not a great first impression.  Will update after regular use with my thoughts."
5,Works great and looks great. Also does not use up lots of space in my tiny kitchen.
2,"The button pad seems hard to push, and I find having to push ""cook"" first and then input the time to be kind of redundant.  My husband is struggling just to make tea in it.  2 minutes is too hot, and trying to get the 30-second increment button to work is a struggle.  Is there something wrong with it?  Who knows.  Toshiba customer service was not very helpful.  I would not buy this microwave again, but it appears that a lot of microwaves are more complex than they need to be for us seniors!"
1,Product made loud banging noises that grew worse with usage.  Amazon refused to stand behind their product sale.  Very disappointing!
5,Replaced a 20 year old 700w GE. Perfect example of all you need and nothing you don't. (Does Not talk to Alexa!)
2,"Loved this appliance, but after only 15 months, the cheap plastic door latch snapped off and it will no longer operate without that piece.  Found tons of replacement parts for numerous other GE models, but not this microwave and after speaking directly to GE I was told that there aren’t replacement parts available for this model and it can’t be repaired.  Very disappointed."
2,"The media could not be loaded.Purchased from Amazon on Oct.  9, 2020.  It is now Oct. 24, 2021.  Oven lights began flashing a few days ago. This morning (Sun. 10/24/2021) began sparking. Too dangerous to continue using. Will go out later this morning and buy a new microwave....NOT Toshiba!"
4,It's working good so far.  I haven't used it that long yet.
1,"The media could not be loaded.Cant get ahold of the company...i noticed my first plateto heat only hot in center even though turntable worked. I put in a dinner to reheat * i am a Chef by profession and smellded something burning. It had burned a standard no metal cardboard to go box on the edges... then i turned it on with nothing in it and the right side arced, started melting and caught fire. See video.. Amazon refunded but rep had to do some talking so i could take it to the trash instead of driving to UPS return. Thank you Amazon. Please contact me Comfee and maybe I do need a LifeLine button to use this microwave."
3,"Wish I'd got another Panasonic, Dooh! It's nice, don't get me wrong.  It has cooked/warmed everything I have needed it for.  But the keypad is not illuminated and very hard to see in anything but full lighting.  The short cut buttons are almost a complete mystery?  As are most other features on this thing.  Looks like the typical engineering department had to much influence on the instruction manual writing.  It is a good 2nd place to the equivalent Panasonic in my opinion. Or try to be different and give it a try like me. Err?"
3,I did not like that you can't choose the amount of time you want
4,I am impressed at how much power this small microwave puts out. My only complaint is that I wish the door was attached at a slightly different angle. It’s kind of an awkward placement.
2,"Not too happy with it - the area of heating seems very narrow focussed and it definitely seemed a step down from our years older, same sized same wattage model."
1,"This unit is nice to look at but when heating any kind of microwaveable product (such as seasoned rice or pasta) where the instructions for the food specifically say ""cook uncovered,"" the seasoning mix winds up on the roof of the microwave or around the edge of the heating vessel, not in the food itself.  I would never buy this unit again, and will likely donate it and purchase another brand."
2,"ordered ""used - good"" and the door only opens 1 out of 10 times when pressing the button. It will open if I ""pull"" on the door by trying to grab inbetween the door and the microwave while pressing the button. There seem to be a lot of door latch problems with Panasonic microwaves. I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
5,This is great if you need a small microwave for your room or office. It has a turntable and all the bells and whistles of a larger model. Great value.
5,"Update Oct 2021 - a few months after getting one for my folks and seeing that they were very happy with this microwave, we finally ditched our weak 700W microwave and got this about 2 weeks ago.It's not much bigger than our weaker microwave but the power difference between 700 and 900W has been a +30 seconds faster cooking time with everything that we cooked before compared to the 700W microwave - steam spinach, warming a cup of water for tea, or heating up frozen meals.  +30 seconds faster cooking time doesn't seem like a lot, but it is when you're in a hurry or using the microwave multiple times per day.The microwave looks sleek and feels sturdy/well built, really like the pre-set buttons (e.g. - simply press #1-6 and it'll start cooking for 1-6mins;  while it's cooking, simply press start again and it'll add 30 seconds to the remaining cook time;  the option to also put it on silent (no beeping sounds) mode is great too)!  Would definitely buy this again and it's a GREAT deal if you can get it close under $125 during promotions/sales.Initial review:Got this a few weeks ago for my parents because their old microwave finally died.  My mom absolutely loves the stainless steel look and that the beeping isn't loud and can be set to silent mode.  My dad said it's pretty strong, they have it on half power and it still warms/cooks foods quickly.  My current microwave is rather weak (about 500w), so I'll get this one when mine dies :)"
2,"The door opener does not work unless you push on it 2 or 3 times, and then you must open the door manually. Since we did not get any warranty papers with it, we have no way to get it fixed. This started almost when we got it."
4,"This review is for the ML-EM45P(BS). The unit works properly as advertised. My only issue which was very frustrating in the beginning was the control panel which is not aligned exactly over the sensors. I struggled to get the clock set, and after cooking with it a few times I realized the problem. If I push on the number 2, the number 5 shows up. There is a very small active part of the panel/sensors and if you have big fingers it can be challenging. Now I know where to touch on the control panel for each function or number, I'll just have to deal with it. Looks like a poor quality control issue. Maybe that's why it was on sale."
4,"Just received this item and am disappointed because the internal measurements are not as in the description!! It is 12"" Dx12"" W x 8"" H.take note of that if you buy it. Was quiet when i tried it. Is easy to clean."
3,works well lacking very basic quick sets and overall unsatisfied but it does work as intended
3,I use my microwave for heating food cooking food and frame food is very nice microwave and I love it. I never noticed that he needed a plate because I was using the metal pan but it needs a glass plate.
5,"...now on my 3rd.  No-nonsense wattage to nuke leftovers, re-heat pizza and make  great popcorn.  Plus it is super-easy to use right out the box.  That is a huge bonus.  It came with an Owner's Manual, but you won't need it. I already know you're not supposed to use it to dry clothes."
3,need this replaced asap or return to Amazon seller
5,"The media could not be loaded.Love my new Panasonic Microwave!!!  Easy to program, cooks thoroughly and food is very tasty.  My old Panasonic lasted for30 plus years.  Great value!Nancy Kerr"
2,Needed to replace a microwave that we’ve had for almost 20 years. Saw good reviews on this. After about 3 weeks of average use the button that you hit that pops the door open doesn’t work. You have to depress it and pull the door. Cheaply made. My old microwave never had this problem after 20 years. This..I guess it’s a sign of the times.
1,Do not buy it might be a great oven but who the heck would know because there are no instructions and you cannot get through to customer service!!!I've never used a convection oven and this is ridiculous the instructions are zero and GE customer service is no help. They told me those instructions are all they have for this unit and they are not even really instructions they're more warnings than anything. The inside label that tells you how much time and settings is so small cannot even read with glasses.
5,"Excellent product. Has all the features I want and need. The operation is intuitive and simple. I'm not cooking complex meals in it. I don't need it to make things look brown.  It is a quality, mid-size unit at a very good price. Highly recommend.  You can buy microwave ovens for 5 and 6 times this price, but unless you are into doing the majority of your cooking in a microwave and need all the bells and whistles, this unit does what most people need. I defrost, reheat, heat frozen microwave products,  soup, etc., and make the best spiced nuts at the holidays."
3,"When I try to open this thing or push any of the buttons I have to push hard bc the buttons require a lot of force to push then the microwave slips and slides all over the place. Also takes forever to warm up my food. Would not purchase this again, the quality isn’t there."
3,Much Smaller than I expected.
3,"Attractive microwave, works great but I have to use a little flashlight in the evening to use it.  Why?  Well, was very surprised to find it has NO TIMER LIGHT.  It has a light inside for when it's running, but to heat a cup of coffee or make popcorn........ I have to use my little flashlight to see the screen.  Very dark screen even with overhead kitchen light on.  Shame, if I'd known that I never would have bought it.  My next microwave WILL have a timer light, that's the first thing I'll look for, guaranteed!!"
3,"Bought this because of the weight, I am FM not strong with some health problems. Wished I got a different one that was almost the same weight. Size is what I expected. Easy to use. Big problem is that the glass turntable keeps popping off. Even weight on plate, plate not heavy, not interfering with it turning. Still pops off. Works with small item that is in the middle of turntable. Went to defrost chicken cutlets and had to do one at a time.  Those reasons why I put one star on easy to use and 3 stars of overall rating."
5,"I like it even it is not one of the most powerful devices. If the description of the food says 2 minutes for example, you have to add some seconds to get the perfect result. Other than that good product and I really like the power safe option."
5,"The media could not be loaded.I love it, compact and noiseless!"
1,Poor quality.  Rattles when in use
2,"Confusing sensor feature renders microwave directions on food items useless. Has a mind of its own. On several occasions it has rendered food inedible after cooking the sh-t out of it, even when using the sensor setting printed on the unit. Also, a part broke off about a month after I bought it. Had to drive an hour r/t to a service center and wait 2 weeks for it to be fixed. Not a good purchase!"
5,Easy to operate. You don't need a book to tell you how it works
1,"Worked for about one year. Heating a slice of pizza one day sparks and fire shot out of microwave. We unplugged it and tried to get Black and Decker/Midea to honor the two year warranty but they are giving us the run around and then radio silence. If you are looking for a good microwave, don’t buy this one. Of note: we kept the microwave very clean!"
3,"This is pretty lightweight, you can feel it and hear it when you close the door, not sure it's gonna be very sturdy for a long life. Product information on Amazon is deceptive, shows the width of the interior chamber at 15"", but it's only 13"". You can see it in the photo on the main product page. I wanted one with the same interior dimensions as my previous one, which was 15"". Now I have to either deal with it not being able to hold items that I was always able to heat or go through the hassle of repacking and returning it, then waiting for another one. Also not pleased with some elements of the control panel, not easy to see some of the essentials. The manual is written in sometimes baffling and odd grammar. Hard to understand instructions for several of the functions. LMK if you can fathom the instructions and restrictions on using the smart sensor function, not kidding. Being generous with the 3 stars."
3,It works good but when using it is noisy ! The space for the start is already peeling off.  It's heavy but heats up good and cooks a sweet potato fast.
3,"It works.  Slower than most of course as it is 700 watts not 1000 or 1200.  The keyboard is a bit annoying.  To use a power %, you have to press a time button first and THEN the minutes and THEN the power %.  But it is inexpensive and it works.  I wouldn't buy it again, but mostly because of the size.  You want a small slower inexpensive one, this is good."
2,"This microwave lasted 7 months. It started out fine, although hard to clean because the element is open on the top (like the bottom of an electric oven). It stopped warming- by the end it was taking 5-6 minutes to warm up a cup of coffee. Don't bother with this one."
4,"the control buttons are not back lit and dark making them difficult to see during operation, otherwise great MV."
1,It died in less than 3 years.The convection  oven never really cooked well and look a long time.The instruction booklet  is not very detailed. Not many preset cooking buttons. Would not buy again.
4,"We've been using this microwave now for nearly 3 weeks. We needed a replacement as our last, a different and cheaper model, wasn't working reliably anymore. This one seems to work great.Upon arrival, I was pleased that it was not very big. Not much bigger than our last actually, yet this is more powerful.It cooks better than our previous one. Seems the food is cooked, and cooked faster, as well as less dried out.This one has a bright, cool light inside, versus a warm, yellow one.Keypad is excellent, an improvement on our last. Lots more options, including one touch buttons for 30 seconds, and 1 through 6 minutes of cooking time. You can also just enter more specific times. So I really like the one touch cook buttons. I feel that's really convenient, but also easy to overcook something if you aren't watching it. Also a plus is the ability to silence the beeps, but it really isn't too loud, and it's fairly quiet cooking food too.Cons:1. It doesn't vent the steam well. However, it is very easy to wipe out with a paper towel. We also just leave the door ajar a few minutes after cooking.2. For me this is a bigger issue, and that is that the tiny feet on this are plastic, and do not have any sort of rubber or pad on them. The microwave being fairly light means it slides around the counter on these tiny plastic feet when you apply force to open and close the door. I had to improvise and put some silicon dots used to silence cabinet doors on the bottom in order to keep it from moving around. Very poor design for the feet, and thus negative one star for the product.I'd give fewer stars for the delivery. It was delivered 3 days late, and apparently sat around for that time in our metro area waiting to be delivered. Not sure what the problem was."
2,"We are RVers.  This thing gets really, really hot on the outside (even with the microwave setting).  Takes forever to cook anything using the convection or air fryer setting.  We tried several different recipes and they all took much longer than a regular oven.  We wound up finishing cooking most of them in our NuWave oven.  Wanted it to work, it didn't."
1,"Purchased for daughter's dorm room.  After 2 days and 1x use, it completely died.  Amazon was great about a refund!!  Will purchase a different brand."
4,"It was perfect.Thanks,"
5,"Was so thankful to find this Panasonic microwave.  It's just like the one I'd had for years & years, same white/black design, same Xtra large size. It's just updated.  I love this microwave. It's so large and I love to cook and I use it alot. I cook frequently for large get togethers, often 20-80 folks.  So, I have to have the big microwave so I can put in large cooking vessels. My last one finally bit the dust and I panicked when I couldn't find a large one. So, went online and immediately was able to find this and was literally overjoyed it was the same Panasonic big microwave. Then, I was shocked when I ordered it and in just a few days!  Wasn't even out of a microwave but for a few days!This microwave is even better than the last one. My prior one lasted me for about 25 years, this one will more than likely outlive me! Great quality, reliability and economical purchase!"
3,"All was fine except for a simple but damaged turntable ring assembly.  Trying to fix the problem is...the problem!  Farberware says to contact Amazon, while Amazon's help site is...no help!  Guess I'll use it with the damaged part. Not happy."
2,"Microwave cooks well. But if you have a new kitchen or electrical panel, this unit will give you fits. Arc fault breakers are required in a lot of places now as part of building codes, and come into play when you remodel. This unit is very sensitive and trips those new breakers almost immediately (more so then our old microwave). If your kitchen is new or recently remodeled, might not be for you."
4,A few years back we had to replace a prior Panasonic that was 30 years old and that new one (not a Panasonic) failed in just a few years so we decided to go back to a Panasonic and glad we did.Love the features. Cooks fast and thorough. Our first microwave using inverter technology and truly like it.Only issue is a crack was discovered in the corner of the enamel paint inside. So I'm going to touch it up with some microwave paint and hope rust doesn't form.  This is why I gave a 4 overall instead of a 5.
5,This fits in our small space above our fridge. The numbers are large and easy to use.
2,"Purchased September 2021, dead July 2023. Light use in a climate-controlled kitchen. Really disappointed, won't buy another Black + Decker microwave!"
2,"Note- my phone automatically enhances photos, so I can't show you the true issue with the buttons. It is impossible to read any of the buttons without using a bright light and getting down on eye level. None of the photos show the true lack of contrast. Why would they only light the clock? I don't need a clock, I need to be able to see the controls without getting down on my knees.I've had a Panasonic for years, but wanted a quiet microwave. This was the main reason I purchased a Toshiba. Yes, you can turn off the beeps, but it is not quiet. The door has to be pulled to open (rather than pushing a button to unlock and open it like my Panasonic), and it is loud! I've tried holding the microwave and slowly opening the door to avoid the bang, but that takes two hands so you can't be holding a cup or plate while opening the door.In spite of weighing more, it feels flimsy compared to my Panasonic.The description touts the 6 Auto Menus but doesn't mention that you can't manually adjust the time. I end up with coffee that is either too hot or still cold. Also, I didn't appreciate what a difference the inverter technology used in the Panasonic helps heat food evenly. Even when I stop and stir food during heating, I end up with cold spots using the Toshiba.Bullet points:1. Can't see buttons and hard to find the exact spot on them to push.2. Noisy and uncomfortable opening door.3. Can't manually adjust the heating time.4. Heats food unevenly.5. Although it weighs nearly 30 pounds, the machine feels flimsy."
5,Easy to use fast set up
1,This is an extremely weak microwave. I have to heat things for twice the recommended time to get them to heat up. Also tons of condensation build up every time so much that the door drips when I open it and I have to wipe it down. Such a pain. Have never experienced such a terrible microwave. Spend a little  more and get something better.
5,Love it. Cooks perfect pizza. We use this full time in our RV. Love having an all in one for space saving. Here are a  few tricks that will help when you first start to use.First off this the outside is much deeper than and average microwave. It most likely won't fit in a built in space for a microwave.After you select temp on oven feature you have to hit start twice to turn on to start pre heat.In our experience it typically takes about 5 mins more added to time for most recipes.We have not found a way to add more cooking time at the end without having to go back through the preheat process. So if need more time I suggest check food fast and restart so you don't have to wait to long for preheat.You have to open and shut the door after preheat before it will let you set cook time.If you counter is not perfectly level the door will swing at you and possibly cause burn as you try to pull out your pan. I usually a coffee cup or something glass in front of the door if I need two hands to pull out what is in the oven.If you just cooked something using the oven feature then use the microwave feature your items will get hot fast. This includes the dish you used to cook in use a oven mitt. I learned this the hard way lol.Also the turn table has to rotate while using the oven feature. So you will not be able to use a pan bigger than and 8x8 for anything. If I am making a large casserole I just make two 8x8s.I know some people will read this and think well that is common sense. I just think it helps to habe a few tips when using a new product.But in all we love this thing. And again this thing make perfect pizza and cakes!!!
1,Fire shot out of the vent inside the microwave while it was running and over heated! Would not buy again!! It’s outside the 30 day return window
4,"It looks decent on the counter and it cooks food as decently as any other.  It's got a good power level and a handle on the door, both are nice features at this price range.The only thing I really dislike is entering a time to cook.  On most microwaves, you press 130 start to cook for a minute and a half.  If you press any number on this microwave, you kick off an express cooking program for that number of minutes.  This part isn't so bad, but - if you want to enter a cook time yourself, you have to press another button twice before entering your cooking time.  The button you press twice sets the clock and sets the cooking time.  For some reason, they decided the first press needs to be setting the clock and two presses is for setting your cook time.  I guess the engineers at Toshiba spend a lot of time setting their clocks.If you aren't crazy like me, and this won't bother you, this is a great microwave for the price."
2,"I was desperately looking for a small microwave and this works for the basic, however it's extremely annoying that the plate and the center wheel circle comes out of place every...single...time!!! I don't just throw the dinner plate on it, I carefully place it there because I don't want it to break and still the plate comes loose, the grippy glass teeth that fits in the center is not long enough for it to stay in place, so freaking annoying and the plastic wheel circle is always dancing around when it's heating up the food. I hope it breaks soon for me to buy another brand! They should sell this for a way lower price because at this pace I'll end up throwing it in the garbage!"
1,"I, unfortunately, had to return this unit, hence the One Star Overal Rating.  It's a very well built microwave with some good features, and I surely would have kept it had it not been for a defective power unit, that would sort of start, hesitate and then start again.  It didn't sound like it was going to last long - probably just past the warranty."
5,It works gr8
1,"First one I bought didn't work and fried out almost immediately. The replacement has a loose fastener retainer or foreign object jammed unto the turntable (I'll need to completely disassemble the unit to clear it). turntable grinds, squeals, and groans whenever I turn the thing on. These things are junk, period."
4,"Got this as a warehouse deal and am quite pleased with it! Though it wasn't in the original box, it was securely re-packaged and came with the original owner's manual. It has done a great job with both cooking and defrosting. No hot spots! Only complaint is that the door doesn't close easily. The latch doesn't move smoothly with a gentle nudge so it requires a firm push to close. Not a big deal & doesn't affect performance."
4,Still getting used to the features so unable to fully review it at this time
1,"The oven stopped heating food only 4 months after I bought it. When I tried it again after unplugging and replugging it, I heard popping noises and saw sparks. Enough said. I was able to get a full refund, but who needs the hassle?"
2,Very disappointed! The first time ordered it was canceled I had to re-order and it was more money the second time. The product came damaged the feet and the microwave broken and the microwave itself was all scratched up as if it was used even though I did not buy it used. It is not easy to use especially the air fryer and the instructions are not very clear. So disappointed!
1,This microwave died after 1 year. I did bit get much use of it.  Take your chances on this purchase.
1,"I bought this 5 years ago. In that time the edges of the interior started to rust.  The cooking results for the same item and the same time duration was very inconsistent. Lastly, when running it would knock out Wi-Fi and cellular singles within 25 foot."
1,"After I read through all the reviews I thought this would be a good microwave. As soon as I unpacked it and plugged it in I turned it on and it makes a crazy loud buzzing noise. As long as I hold my hand to the right side of the microwave it stops making the noise. I think maybe the one I received was defective, it’s almost like the metal is slightly too large because it flexes back and forth when you press on it. Im really disappointed with the quality of the product. Overall the look and feel was good but the noise is unbearable."
2,"Microwave looks good on the surface but feels a little cheap and is light enough that just opening and closing the door makes it slide around the counter. I'm all for lighter electronics, but at LEAST put some rubber feet on your products. Nice space inside though and GREAT lighting. Unfortunately the wifi features are locked behind an app that is complete and utter trash. Tried to log in on multiple phones on all three ways (email, facebook, twitter) provided and get a system error each time. Don't waste your time on this thing."
2,"UPDATE:In addition to the problems listed in my review, now the turntable has started to make a loud noise. It sounds kind of like a dying animal...what a waste of my money this was.I purchased this oven in August and 3 months later there are two problems already.When reheating a dinner plate, I select the preset for that purpose which puts 2 minutes and 30 seconds on the timer. When the oven is done, the food is not hot. If I add another 30 seconds, the plate is extremely hot but the food is heated unevenly. For example, mashed potatoes scalding, peas almost shriveled and meatloaf slices about 1 inch thick are cold in the middle.Today, the keypad sounds stopped working so I need to look at the display to make sure the oven has accepted my input.I think a warranty replacement is in order here before it develops any additional problems, unless of course I can get a refund and buy a different brand."
2,I just purchased this and plan on returning it.  It is very loud!! Very disappointed with this Panasonic product.
2,This is either not a powerful microwave or I don’t know how to use it correctly. I have to add twice the regular amount of time to heat up food.It’s not the worst microwave. The size is good for small spaces and I have mine on top of my mini fridge in my classroom.
1,"Works, but wobbles."
5,"My over the stove microwave oven has been acting up the past year and it is going to be hard to find an exact replacement as the layout of the kitchen cabinetry was custom made for it.  In the meantime, it is back to having a simple countertop microwave to saving the day!  For that task, this Chefman is even easier to use than my older big name brand microwave.It has the classic stainless steel housing with the deep black window that fits into most kitchen decor.  Mine sat level on my countertop which is always a good thing.Controls on the key pad is easy for anyone to master in a few minutes.  I personally never venture into the fancier settings.  I just hit power and time cook.  Yes, plain and simple for me.  The microwave is as quiet as any new one can operate.  For now, this is my go to microwave until I get a replacement for over the stove.  One negative on countertop microwaves is that it eats up prime countertop real estate.5 Stars overall."
2,"Have always used and liked Panasonic microwaves in the past.  Ordered this to replace one that stopped working.  The control panel did not tightly adhere to the body of the microwave and when the unit was on, the internal light beamed through the side of the control panel.  It was probably safe to use, but I didn't feel comfortable keeping it.  Sent it back and ordered a replacement of the same microwave.  Unfortunately the second one had the same problem.  Gave up at this point and ordered a different brand."
3,"Has a blind spot in the LED display, so that if you have it on your fridge and push the buttons with your right hand, you can't see the numbers on the display.  You have to move to the left or to the right.Also, does not have a ""Quick Start"" feature that most other microwaves seem to have: button 1 starts 1:00 minute time, etc.  You have to type all the numbers in and press start.It does have a way to turn off the sound of the beeping, which is nice, but then it turns off all beeping, including for the Cooking Timer, which makes that feature useless.If you don't mind all that, it gets the job done and cooks things fast."
2,"Ive had this microwave for less than 6 months and the door button has already stopped working. You have to really ""work""  the button and help the door open with other hand. Id like a refund/replacement."
1,"Blew a fuse after 6 months and because it was a made in China, the fuse was a chinese brand and  american fuses don't fit.  Good Luck finding a chinese fuse in this country!"
3,The microwave oven is too small for my needs I tried popcorn and the bag is too large to rotate around and cook completelyI may send it backIf you need a small microwave oven it’s perfect
2,"I should have looked at the pictures better and seen that there weren't easy one touch buttons.  The instructions to program it were difficult, especially as after every power outage, I'd have to go through each step again, not just resetting of the clock...resetting everything.  It was so frustrating (yes, we live in the country, and lose power a lot, we do have a generator that kicks on, but it takes 20 seconds and the microwave has reset by then).  Anyway, so frustrating that we literally only used the 30 second button.  We'd just hit it however many times we needed for however long we were cooking.  Not great, but it worked.  For a while.I've had this  just shy of 19 months today.  Yesterday is sparked and I searched for what could have made it spark...I was heating up a glass bowl (to place over cold butter) for 45 seconds (well, 60, because I can't choose 45 as mentioned above) and about 15 seconds into it, the inside looked like the 4th of July.  I stopped the machine, pulled out the bowl - which was STEAMING hot (after 15 seconds!!!) and put the butter back in the microwave on a small Corel plate (microwave and dishwasher proof) and again, 15 seconds later, the machine was popping and sputtering.  Butter was totally melted (cold butter just out of fridge, melted in about 9 seconds.  I tried again today with a paper plate and a pizza, and it was under 10 seconds that it started popping like it was going to explode.It is now unplugged and in the trash."
5,"Now that we've had this a little while I can confidently say it was a great purchase! Just what we needed and it's holding up well. We don't use it daily, but multiple times a week for sure."
2,Very loud And the glass plate inside wobbles
3,"Our big wall microwave oven broke so I thought this might be a good substitute until we replaced our combo oven/microwave unit. Sadly this microwave at 700 watts was a poor choice. It heats food unevenly and takes longer. I found the best use was to heat up water for hot drinks. Based on my experience, I think that it might be good for an office break room or a dorm room. If you are someone that is a heavy user, I'd look elsewhere.The good points were that it's easy to use out of the box without reading the manual. It's easy to clean. It's relatively small."
2,"Heats food fine.  Low review is due to the controls.  If I want to heat something for 45 seconds I would expect to hit 4, 5 then start.  I would also be ok with hitting a cook time button, 4, 5, then start.  But no, hitting the 4 button starts it going for 4 minutes.  So you might say, why don’t you just hit the Cook Time button in the lower right corner?  Well because it is double duty button so pressing it once resets it to clock.  You have to press it TWICE then enter your time.  I had to look in the manual to figure out how to cook for a certain time!  Some product designer was laying out that panel and thought I am running out of space and I need to have a Cook Time button and a Potato button… what should I do???  Well obviously people microwave potatoes WAY more than they select a specific cook time so that is an easy decision.  After that decision was made, it was a no brainer that people would prefer to hit the Clock button only once and wouldn’t care about having to hit it twice JUST TO HEAT SOMETHING UP FOR 45 SECONDS!!!"
1,"The microwave worked great for a year and a half, then it just stopped heating anything up one day out of nowhere! Then when I call Toshiba customer service, I was told ""They couldn't help with anything"".. So we never plan to buy Toshiba again!!!"
5,"Doesn’t work. The clock set but anytime I try to run it, the fan and motor does not cut on. It does not heat or spin!Contacted amazon support and they overnighted a new one to arrive the next day! New one has been received and works great!!The size of these is larger than I expected! Very heavy though, so be warned! I got it at a steal compared to the .9 cubic feet microwaves online!"
4,"This Microwave worked perfect for my tiny camper. It is the perfect size and doesn't take up too much space. My only complaint is the programing on how to use it. It is not your normal so be prepared. Other than that part, everything else is great. I love that is a creamy color and not bright white"
4,"I know the dimensions are listed on the specs, but once I got it on the counter I realized how big it actually is."
1,"Pros: SizeCons: 1. The control pad is very resistant to being pushed. In order to make a selection, you literally have to hold on to the unit to keep it from sliding away. I admit it's on top of my refrigerator, which is metal, but the level of pressure to engage a control is dumb. I used it on quartzite counter top and it would slide around. Maybe if it's on very rough wood it wouldn't slide around; maybe. 2. When the table is rotating the noise is a wa, wa, wa, wa. Loud enough to be unwanted."
4,"Did not buy for Alexa integration and have found it to be a useless gimmick. Why do you need to use Alexa when you're already at the microwave anyway. Also, did not like the fact that you must touch ""cook time"" twice in order to set cook time. Have had to reset clock many times in the week we've had this oven because if you only touch cook time once, you change the clock. As for heating it works wonderfully. Replaced a 30+ year old Toshiba with this unit. Old microwave still worked as designed but didn't go with our kitchen remodel. We wanted to buy a Toshiba again because of this reliability."
3,Las medidas no son las del anuncio !
2,Does not warm food in a timely manner. I have to warm twice to get hot.
4,All in all it was a microwave but it seems like it was always breaking just plan to buy 2 in a yr especially for high volume use
2,Really no back light on displayYou need a flashlight to read tha dang display
3,was disappointed for several reasons. First I received the wrong color. I ordered stainless steel but I received a black one with silver colored trim on the front. But I can see from the box that I dont think the people from shipping could tell. Also I got this to replace a previous one and this was more money but doesnt work as well. For example on the previous one I could put a side dish to heat in the microwave and use the kitchen timer on the screen at the same time. You can now only use one at a time. Also it didnt come with any directions. And finally the other reviewers are right that this unit is very noisy.
2,"In reading the reviews for this product, I saw that there had been issues with the MySmartLife app reverting to a single time zone, in my case, 2 hours ahead of CST. I was under the impression that this had been fixed however. I received my unit yesterday and hooked it up today. Everything seems to work fine EXCEPT for the fact that the time continues to update to the incorrect time every few minutes. I like this microwave, but I'm pretty certain I can find one that I like just as much that has the correct time. I've left a review on the App Store page for the developer and I'll see whether or not this issue is resolved soon. If not, I will be returning this unit. In my opinion, the stupidest reason for returning something like this, but I kind of like knowing what time it REALLY is at any given time of the day.ADDED 1/21/21: Well, I REALLY wanted to like this microwave and tried to work around the glitches that were more window dressing than substance; i.e., the Alexa connectivity. But, I just couldn't do it. First, I really like knowing the time without having to substract from what I'm given. I solved that problem by using the unit without any hooking up with Alexa and the terrible, terrible app that Toshiba uses. Secondly, I found that more times than not, the kitchen timer function fails to issue a beep when it's done. That's annoying, since we use the timer a lot and aren't always able to see it. Finally, the one primary directive that ALL microwaves should be adept at is cooking/heating stuff. In this, it just didn't measure up. As an example, heating soup in a pyrex dish is a pretty standard function. This microwave got the dish hot enough that you needed potholders to remove it, but the soup was, at best, mildly warm inside. This was a bridge too far for us, so we reluctantly returned it to Amazon and ordered another unit from another manufacturer. Very sad because this was a great fit, had good features (if they had worked), and was a nice looking unit. I hope the next one works out better!"
4,"I bought this to replace a Toshiba that broke very quickly.  It works well, however, it does take up a lot of counter space."
2,Ive had it 6 months.  It gets lite usage.  The turntable is already messed up.  Junk.
2,Glass plate inside wobbles
1,It makes a terrible noise when startingUgh
1,Recently it started to act funny.  Now it runs with door open.  Not sure who to contact about that.
2,IT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO AND THE MANUEL DOESN'T GO INTO ENOUGH DETAIL ABOUT HOW TO CROSS REFERENCE THE THREE FUNCTIONS....CONVENTION.....AIRFRYER...MOCROWAVE. WISH THE CONTROL PANEL WASN'T ALL BLACK AS IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A VISUALLY IMPAIRED LIKE ME TO READ IT WITHOUT A MAGNIFYING GLASS.
4,"This microwave is very nice as far as technology and power. It easily fits large items, warms up leftovers perfectly and has enough power to heat any food or drink quite quickly. Beware: this microwave is huge...of course it has to be to hold a turkey. But if you have limited counter space or only a narrow shelf to put it on, this microwave probably won't fit properly. All in all, I do love it. Works great - just bigger than expected."
5,I've had this for just over a year and has worked flawlessly.  Some reviews had stated that the air fryer function didn't actually work.  I'm air frying some dino nuggets as I type this so I'm not sure what they were referring to.
2,"The oven stopped heating occasionally ,especially when you need it!!!!"
3,"I purchased this microwave back in 2020 after getting divorced. Now 3 years later, I am experiencing the paint bubble under the turntable and the strip of paint behind the door separating as a whole on the flat vertical surface. This microwave was mainly used 3 to 4 times per week and cleaned regularly. While inexpensive, I would expect an appliance to have a life cycle of more than 3 years."
4,"Okay I got this because I really like the color and you were able to turn the sound off. As far as using the functions not intuitive at all.  Requires you to set the power, press the arrow key then turn the knob to choose your time. Then prrrs the arrow key again to start. It has been frustrating my guests. So I just leave the manual right next to it. The power is rather minimal... you have to cook TV dinners at least one and a half times longer than the stated amount on the directions.So PROS: you can turn the sound off.The turntable always returns to its starting point. Nice if you're  heating your coffee so the handle returns to an easy position to grasp. Cool color.CONS: Odd interface. Not intuitive. Low power."
3,Very small
1,"We bought this for my daughter's dorm room in August of 2021...she confirmed nobody has put any metal objects into the microwave.  My wife just visited her in NYC and found out the right-side, interior panel has been sparking consistently so they stopped using it.  I just searched ""spark"" in the comments/reviews and apparently a lot of other consumers are having the same issue.  This could be a MAJOR fire hazard.  Now 4 roommates are out a microwave...$150and it didn't even last 7 months."
4,"Small, which is what I needed, but the wattage is a bit low but works good"
2,"I've had this Microwave just over 3 years. It's just me, so not overused.  The display has since started losing clarity, the turntable thuds and clunks while in use, and the interior enamel is bubbling and peeling. I would not buy it again. I did some research, and this is far too soon to have to replace it. I bought it initially because it was top rated. Maybe the ratings were written too soon."
4,Pretty good so far... enough for our needs (popcorn and warming up food).
5,"I was surprised by how quiet this microwave is in comparison with my over-the-cooktop LG.  The LG has been giving me problems with the control card, I fixed it several times yet I realized his time is up. It is only about five years old, but after reading reviews on Amazon on several brands I realized that since they are all made in the same Country.... they are all cheaply made and don't last. Apparently most newer ones only last about 2-3 years.  So I was frustrated and not happy at all to pay $300 for a replacement that I know will only last 2-3 years no matter what brand.Long story short I decided to leave the LG alone and just buy a simpler one. This one works great, looks great and it was a lot cheaper. It is almost as big as the LG and is powerful enough. I use to have another small microwave but I could not make popcorn.  By the way, this microwave has three settings for popcorn, you just need to push the button once, two, or three times depending on the size of the popcorn bag. (two times for the most common size)I can not tell you about all the fancy features because I don't use them. I don't cook on microwaves, I only use it to reheat and to make popcorn."
4,It looks good but is only stainless on the front of the unit.  I was hoping it was stainless all around.  It works good but is a little loud.
1,"If you purchased this recently, I recommend you get your money back and buy another brand. I purchased this ""beautiful"" microwave Jun 21, 2022. Mostly used it to microwave. Only airfried a couple of times. Bought less than 8 months ago but today, February 10, 2023, it stopped working. No problem, still under warranty. When I contacted GE, they told me they would give me a rebate. This means I would have to go out, buy another piece of junk from them, then send them the receipt of purchase plus the rebate form and in 6-8 weeks I would receive a check from them. I spent 221.00 on this microwave. I am not going to buy another GE microwave. I want my money back. They said it doesn't have any moving parts, so it cannot be repaired. Why manufacture something that cannot be repaired. Very disappointed in their service and their products. No more GE appliances for me. Purchased a stove from them that needed repair in less than 13 months, right after warranty ran out. GE, your rebate system sucks."
5,"This microwave heats everything thoroughly and does not dry food out.  Heats coffee, soup, other drinks perfectly."
1,"I got this primarily because I needed something to replace my broken microwave and was lazy about going to a store.... I followed every direction, pushed every button they wanted me to set up this machine and as soon as I try to cook something it gives me an error code...I'm not sure if it's something I did or it was something some previous customer did (conjecture)... Apparently it was a power issue within the unit. I tried plugging it in to different outlets in the house and it still gave me the same error message...I sent it back... Good riddance!"
1,For something thats a large appliance like this PLEASE just go to the store. I spent the money on this microwave and when it came in the mail it wouldnt turn on. I waited for a couple family members to mess with it and see if they could get it to work. By the time I really took the time to figure it out the amazon return period had expired. ( which is my fault)  but it had only been maybe two weeks. Overall having to fight with toshiba now to get my money back and cant even get a hold of them. This microwave has such good reviews that I just didnt see it coming but honestly when your buying something heavy like this just go to the store and get it so that you dont have to fight with trying to get it returned. I guess I'm just the unlucky one but mine had no power. I tried everything to get it to even light up. It couldnt get any power at all. So overall at this point  amazon just unapologetically ate my money.
5,"Works fine, nothing wrong with it, good little microwave for the price, fits right on top of a magic chef mini fridge."
1,Light doesn’t turn on when heating or when the door is open.
1,I had to put tape over the horrible glaring light that filled the kitchen with a blue glow at night.  Other features are ok.
3,Extremely difficult to make work with Alexa. You have to use a third party software and integration with Alexa is not easy if not impossible to set up. You have to make sure your internet is 2.4 instead of 5.0. Works decent as a manual microwave....push the buttons. You might as well just not fool with attempting to work with Alexa....you have to manually put the food in the microwave anyway.
4,It is quiet but It would have been nice if it had a push button to open the door. You need to be gentle when closing the door so it will last a long time. Faberware is very good brand.
1,"This microwave looks good and has decent specs, BUT ... beware — as others have reported, you may experience a potentially dangerous flare up accompanied by multiple flashes and crackling sounds.I have had this oven for 7 months now. After about 2 months I experienced what appeared to be electrical arcing when trying to defrost a stick of frozen butter. After only a few seconds the flashes and crackling sounds started and the oven lit up inside. After reading several other reviews, I assumed this was just a reaction with the fat getting heated unevenly. I decided not to use it for defrosting or melting butter.Today, after 7 months of light usage, I was defrosting a small bowl of frozen blueberries, when after only 9 seconds the oven again sparked and crackled with loud sounds and brilliant flashes. No fat, just frozen blueberries. I have successfully defrosted blueberries many times in this oven — until today.There is no longer a “return this item” button on my order details, presumably because it’s past its return date. Given my experience and having read of the experiences of several other reviewers, I strongly urge potential purchasers to consider other units, no matter how appealing this one looks to you. (It has dropped in price since I bought it on Amazon. I would still not buy it again.)"
4,"This microwave seems to be working fine, but unless your kitchen is very well lit, the control panel can be a little difficult to read. More contrast would have fixed this. Also, there is no way to turn off the blinking ':' between the numbers on the clock. Anything blinking continually in a space can be an unpleasant distraction for some people."
1,"Update 11/24/2016  Very bad!  If I could rate it with NO stars I would.Well this was a waste of $70.00.  after barely over 1 year, the turn table gave out and made soooo much noise I decided to junk this thing.  You would think that RCA would have a better product, but as the saying goes,  ""that's what I get for thinking"".  It never did cook evenly, but I put up with it as it was so darn heavy I couldn't think of returning it...... heavier than any micro wave I've ever owned.  Into the trash it goes.11/2015  The buzzer is VERY annoying.  Not only does it sound (4) times when the cooking/heating is finished, it buzzes when you open the door for no reason, and if you stop it before the time is finished it buzzes, but if you open the door when the finished buzzer starts it doesn't stop buzzing it continues with the (4) buzzes. The other thing that is not to my liking is when you use it as a timer, it only buzzes once. ONCE, can you believe that?  If you are in the other room you would never hear it.  Now this buzzer wouldn't be so bad with all of the above, but......IT IS SO LOUD IT COULD WAKE THE DEAD. I finally went online to see how to disable the buzzer and got some good advise.  I have taken it apart per the instructions I found and covered up the buzzer with foam.  I did this twice before I could notice a difference in the loud sound.  I am still planning on taking it apart again and cutting the wire to the buzzer to stop it completely.  The ONLY good thing that the buzzer does after the initial finished buzzing, , is buzz (3) times, (once would be sufficient) to remind you that you haven't taken whatever out of the oven.  Except for the buzzer it is working well.  Just wish I could have found one that didn't have all of the unneeded button selections."
5,Cheapest microwave money could buy to use while I got parts for my installed microwave. Not sure what is up with microwaves these days but they only work a year or so before breaking. This is my backup now. This worked great and is waiting in the basement to fill in when required
4,"I was frustrated last night by that yellow sticker, similar to another commenter. Nowhere could I find an edge of protective film to start peeling, and I didn’t want to ruin the keypad. This morning I used a damp washcloth to start removing just the impossibly sticky yellow sticker — low and behold the film underneath started to peel back as well! So FYI for anyone with a similar puzzle.BTW thank you to all commenters, on any Amazon  product. Even though I bought this particular item from a local store, I always check Amazon reviews before buying anything. Pros and cons are all very helpful!"
1,"I live in an apartment that does not come with a microwave so I bought this to have one. It fit perfectly in my kitchen and worked pretty well. Unfortunately yesterday when I used it, after about 5 seconds I saw red flashes going off inside and it was smoking. Needless to say I needed to return it. That was pretty easy but that was Amazon and not the manufacturer. Pretty disappointed the purchase didn’t work out. I would not recommend this at all considering it is an electrical hazard."
5,It works perfectly fine.. My only complaint is would it have killed you to put rubber on the feet? This thing slides around the counter top every time you touch it like it's in the Ice Capades....
4,I like this microwave oven. it is attractive and easy to use.
5,I trusted the RCA brand as I had bought many time before. this microwave works very well with the 700 watts. cooking time is not long and i like it better than a 1000 watt+ microwave. most of the time I always over cook my food and causes the food to dry out. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a small microwave and lower watts. this one is good
5,It take too long to get things hot.Things that should take 2 minutes take 5 minutes.I mean simple things as microwaving a hot dog. Which should be done in one min. It take three min to do so.
5,"Thank you Amazon and Toshiba.,"
2,"In all fairness, I did not purchase this product via Amazon, but am searching for one to replace it that's more reliable, and am writing this review to be helpful to others who may also be looking and want honest feedback.Here are the problems:  Loud, grinding noise while operating, cardboard piece over area of microwaving system, can't clean this or it will shred, plate becomes off track every single time of usage, prior unit was dysfunctional after a few months - store kindly gave me this replacement, which does the same things the other one did, only did not spontaneously rust inside as the other one did - yet.And another strange thing, well - it's not a deal breaker, as I have a French dictionary from high school still, but the buttons are all written in French.  These buttons also are somewhat harder to press.  There's no trouble with the door and so far no sparking.  I've had it two weeks.These are things that have to work properly to be safe.  I thank all the people who took the trouble to write their problems with all the microwaves they've had, as this could mean someone's safety.  It's more than personal tastes or whims.  It's information that can really make a huge difference.  Anyhow, that's my reason for writing.  I do not recommend this product, tho can't quite say which one I'd get next - it's working ok so far, tho now making an additional amount of strong noise while operating.  I'm watching it and making my decisions based on observation.  So far so good, but am on the verge of trying to switch it out again.  Odd, chemically aroma to it - thought it was just new, or something - but disconcerting."
5,Good for the money
5,This is a smart little microwave. Does not take up a lot of counter space. This is very easy to program as well. Comes With turning table as well. Overall its a good fit. Makes a nice housewarming gift as well.
3,"I didn't realize what a difference it would make compared to my old, dead oven. When it died, I needed a quick replacement, and this model was the only one with promised same day delivery.  All the others would take several days to arrive. This one is rated at 900 watts, and replaces my 1200 watt (?) old one. So food requires a third more cooking time. I should have known this, but still, using it came as a surprise."
3,"This microwave is a good unit, but with minimal usage the lightbulb went out within the first year of use.  It started by just blinking and then completely failed.  If the light is important to you, I'd recommend another unit as it cannot be replaced at home."
2,"This microwave is in our kitchen and we have to turn up the tv in the living room....Noisy as hell...sounds like metal grinding against more metal...It's nice looking, works well easy to use if you can stand the noise"
2,For a low-cost microwave that you can't expect much out of...this is your product!  It lasted about 18 months in a low-use household before dying a fast death!
5,"Easy to use, large and heats food appropriately. My only complaint is that it’s is one of the noisiest microwaves that I have ever owned."
5,Fits nicely into small spaces and looks very professional. Only 700 watts so takes a little more time but I never miss my big bulky microwave.
3,Was making a strange noise when not in use. I returned. Also has a horrible key pad that you cant even see unless you have extra light turned on.Not user friendly at all.
2,We were so happy with this microwave that I purchased one for my daughter. I liked the button options and it was easy to clean. But that didn't last. 18 months later it died. And warranty is only 12 months. Very disappointed.
5,It is so quiet and easy to use.  It's the best microwave oven that I have ever used.
2,"Not the best microwave. Not great construction and doesn’t hold up well. Noticed when I got it that the frame of the back didn’t align to the front. The buttons on the front were easily scratched and the surface layer is already peeling off so they no longer look very good. Bought in early October 2021, buttons didn’t last through November."
5,"Overall, not badLikes:Pretty quietPower level is good (cooks quickly)Finish seems to clean up pretty easilyDislikes:Microwave door is slightly crookedSome of the presets (like popcorn) just aren't effective at their intended function"
1,"Microwave turns on and works. However, it stopped heating. I would not recommend unless one feels the need to add to the landfills. This microwave was a complete waste of money."
3,No reheat feature
4,The overall functioning of the oven is good. But the heating plate is a bit shaky
4,"I've had this microwave for few months now..  Noticed a few things to consider about this if anyone is thinking of buying it...First...  the Alexa integration is neat sure.  It is kinda cool to put a cold cup of coffee in the micro before bed and when you wake up the next morning to simply tell Alexa ""Microwave 60 seconds"" from the bedroom and the microwave in the kitchen starts heating up that cup of coffee..  But that feature can also be a problem if Alexa misunderstands you and ends up turning on your Microwave for an extended time...Second..  The numbers on the keypad are preprogrammed by minute.  So..  if you press 4, it starts microwaving for 4 minutes...  you can't just type in your cook time and start...  There is a button called ""Cook Time Clock"".  and if you hit that a specific number of times it will allow you to actually input the length of time you want to cook.. but if you do it wrong, then you have just reset your microwave clock time."
1,"I have had this microwave about a week. First, it is HUGE!  You can put your largest pyrex baking dish in here and it has room to fully turn. Second, it is the worst microwave I have ever owned. On popcorn setting and ""regular set minutes and run setting"", it burns the middle of the popcorn, yet leaves a large handful of kernels un-popped. My last microwave would leave about five kernels behind. I also have a small, inexpensive microwave that leaves maybe ten kernels behind. When warming water in a mug for tea, after one minute, water is still cold. After two minutes, the water boils over about half the time and is hot the rest of the time. Mugs that have never come out of the microwave scorching hot before, are now. Food sensor setting doesn't work. Food is cold in the middle and burned around the edges. Burned. Like charred black! I have never experienced a microwave that burns food before. I am so disappointed in this Panasonic microwave. Save yourself a headache. This is not the microwave you are looking for."
5,Would recommend. Great for the price.
4,Hard to see features .
4,"I purchased this to replace a VERY noisy GE microwave.  It fits the space I have, the controls are easy to use, it's quiet, AND I can mute the beeps.  My right-out-of-the-box nitpick is that the oven does not sit level, because the feet are not adjustable.  (The surface IS level.)  We can level and steady the oven with small shims, but that should not be necessary.I'll update this review once I've put it through its paces."
3,"I bought this for my daughter and her family because hers was damaged in a house fire on 11/8.  They lost everything!  This appliance is dented.  The box was not dented, but the content was.  Very disappointed.Shame on the seller and manufacturer."
5,"I definitely look forward to using this product in my ""Retirement apartment""!!!! AWESOME!!!!!"
3,"The size is about to be perfect. The glass disk could be better. Now it is not really fixable. The package of amzon is Good. I got it with no damage. But But ButThere are three scratches on the screen, which are apprently  artifical. Amazon is doing Good to me andhelped me a lot, I will pretend not to see."
1,"Farberware does not guarantee there microwaves.  They sold the business to Edge Consumer.  Edge consumer reair line answers and tries to sell me a Med-Alert bracelet.  I also have an Assurion service plan,  they cant help because the don't cover  it during manufacturer warranty.Talked to Amazon support, and they are getting me a replacement.  But I would NOT buy another Farberware Electric appliance."
2,Sensor reheat burns everything. Cooks two to three times longer than necessary.Buttons aren’t easy to push.Door open button is a fingerprint magnet.
5,"I have used this microwave (Panasonic Microwave Oven NN-SN686S) to heat water and leftovers. I have had it for almost a week. It has replaced my old lower-power microwave and fits in the same amount of space as the one I replaced even though it is higher-powered (1200 watts) and has a larger inside dimension. It is not big enough to fit a large turkey, but it will fit a large chicken (not that I would ever cook a chicken in a microwave). It has a nice variety of easy to use power levels and cooking and defrost options. It was delivered on the second day by USPS in great shape even though I did not choose a faster shipping option - thank you Amazon and shipper."
3,We bought this like new from AMZ warehouse based on Wirecutter reviews. Never had an issue with a warehouse item besides this one. Door has always been a little uneven when closed. Food gets insanely hot on the bottom by the plate but less in the center and on top. Light blew and now strobes when cooking. For example cooking a potato on the baked potato setting will burn it on bottom but be relatively ok on top. Started a fire once. Most things burn on the auto settings to some degree. Definitely regret buying this from the warehouse because I don't think the warranty is as long. I think the auto settings aren't great either and require several taps based on the weight of the food which is kind of stupid because the difference between a 9oz dinner plate and 13oz dinner plate is nominal. This thing shouldn't require a scale to use.
2,"I was excited about it as a microwave x convection oven but it really takes up too much space and has other safety 'rules' that make it difficult to use. The light bulb blew out within a year so it's pitch black now and the plastic film is so damaged. Apparently it isn't supposed to peel so it's just dirty looking. It really doesn't hold up to time. It's a purchase I regret and when I purchase another microwave, I will go simple. It just wasn't worth the price. I love my air fryer and rice cooker, and will soon replace this monster with a simple microwave."
3,It is very hard to press in the keys on the Key pad.  The connection is made when area above the number is depressed.  It has taken me weeks to figure out how to comfortably use it.  It's as if the front of the key pad isn't lined up to the connection behind.
4,"had to replace my old oven. wanted to do it quickly.. ordered on Friday, delivered on sunday.  I set the oven up on my kitchen counter.. read the owner's booklet, cover to cover.. then, in awhile I decided to warm a very small plate of leftovers.. set it at 40 seconds.. when the bell rang, indicating it was done, ... I opened the door and a huge amount of either smoke or vapor poured out of the oven..  I was alarmed, because I first thought it was smoke. though it didn't smell like something burning. I won't go into the efforts it took to get to talk to someone about this.. but I persisted because I didn't want to ship it back, if I didn't have to.. anyway, I spoke to the distributer of this brand oven and he assured me that unless I really smelled smoke, indicating fire, then it was completely normal for the vapor to form, especially food coming from the fridge.  I am going into this detail because when I read customers' reviews I saw reference to similar concerns, but, no one said what had happened next!  so, for future potential buyers of this oven.. if you experience the same thing.. I found out that it is common for this oven according to distributer. they told me that they get quite a few calls about this issue on this oven..  it is fine... now, I am noticing that it doesn't seem to be as copious an amount of vapor as the first time I operated the oven. seems to be diminishing, through continued use,  though there is still some vapor in the amounts to be expected..  hope this is helpful, wish I had seen this type info either as I was buying or after I received it."
3,"When I ordered this microwave I knew it would be small and not very powerful.  I really don’t use a microwave for cooking, only reheating and for hot water for tea. So, with that in mind, the microwave is just what I expected.  If you need a microwave for regular cooking, I probably would not recommend this one. But, if you only need a “teapot” then this is the one for you!"
5,"I am very happy with my purchase. Its easy to clean, perfect size, and the price point was exactly what I had plan to spend for my next microwave. The 1100 watts reheats leftovers very quickly. I use the microwave to cook my baking potatoes, popcorn, boil water for tea, but not to cook meals only to reheat leftover food (i.e., Chinese food, reheat biscuits, and muffins). The preset buttons are also a great feature and helps to take the guess work out reheating some foods."
3,"I really loved this microwave soo much! It's huge, the convenient door handle, the buttons never broke, and it heated really well. But sadly after only 1 year and 8 months it sparked and started smoking and smelled like it was burning. I have to say I'm pretty sure my mom didn't put anything that contained aluminum in it when it happened (it was a cupcake with a plastic/baking wrapper). I'm still on the fence if I want to repurchase cause my old microwave lasted so many years."
3,"I had a tough time finding a space where this microwave could sit because the electric cord/plug is very big and bulky, in comparison to the size of the appliance.  The microwave, itself, met my expectation on size, but I had no clue that the cord/plug would be as bulky (large) as it is/sticks out as far as it does - which precludes me from placing it in a small corner location. Unfortunately, I can't return it because the box in which it arrived was ""soiled"" by painters, or I would not have kept it."
4,"Clean & functional.  The ""Done"" tone is a rather quiet chirp, I would have liked a much louder tone.  It has a built-in WiFi control/monitor feature, but it requires an Alexa.  I had hope to get it to work with just an Android phone, but no luck.  Keypad has no tactile feedback & the user interface is a little confusing."
4,Alittle nosey but for the price eirks great
2,"I have been a fan of this brand in this past. This is the 4th I've bought. This oven gave off a burning plastic smell the first 3 or 4 times i used it. When setting it up for first use, the keyed in inputs didn't yield  results in instruction manual. I had to unplug it and reset the oven  It occasionally slips into child lockout mode and won't accept  any inputs. It takes too much pressure on numerals in keypad when not locked out"
2,Product seems to work great but arrived damaged with a large dent on the top. Guess I’ll keep it I don’t feel like going threw the trouble of a return. Bummed out
1,Bought this GE Microwave in September 6 Months later it is broken. It is not very durable.
4,I purchased this about 6 months ago for my roommate and I. We use it pretty lightly and we haven't had any problems with it. It'll do the job if you're looking for something affordable but reliable. Our only complaint is that the thin plastic covering over the control buttons has developed holes and started peeling away pretty badly after only a few months of use.
4,"Got this today, and so far we love it!I honestly can't speak about durability or longevity...but the kids love it."
1,The microwave works fine but after 5 months started beeping loud for first 15sec that it's turned on like its done.
5,"Beautiful microwave , but it literally just stopped heating the food after 2 months. Sounds like it’s working , but no . Tried everything suggested to trouble shoot . Tried submitting a warranty ticket . Frustrated ."
1,kitchen it stop working before a year the plate inside stop turning
1,Not enough power
3,"Unit moves quite a bit when opening via the handle.  Returned it for antoher brand that is heavier and doens't move around the counter when opening and closing.  A button would have been better on a lightweight unit. Too bad because I thought it was stylish.  Wife complained brand new it ""reeked"" and smelled like Indian spices even though it was new.  Not sure how a smell like that got into it from the factory where its produced."
4,"no other one we have found lets you turn off the beep. it is not noisy otherwise, either, but there was a strong plastic smell that went right into the food at first, although my spouse couldn't taste it.  if you are sensitive to scents and flavors, then you might want to run it with something like vinegar many times before you expose your food to it. otherwise, a great deal."
2,Buttons started peeling immediately
4,"I'll get right down to basics on this countertop microwave, comparing with other Farberware microwaves offered.  I am comparing with these three other, similar models:Farberware Classic FMO11AHTPLB 1.1 Cubic Foot 1000-Watt Microwave Oven, White/PlatinumFarberware Professional FMWO11AHTWHC  1.1 Cubic Foot 1000-Watt Microwave Oven, WhiteFarberware Classic FMO11AHTBKB 1.1 Cubic Foot 1000-Watt Microwave Oven, Stainless SteelAll of these currently sell for $50 less.  So, what are you spending an extra 33% ($50) for with this model?  You get ""Smart Sensor cooking"", which usually is a humidity sensor that senses when the food is cooked by how much humidity is in the oven.  You get 1100 watts of power vs. 1000, which it about 10% more power - probably not noticeable.  You get Energy Saver power mode, which supposedly saves some energy when you are not using the oven... and the amount saved is probably not much.  Other than how it looks and few extra preset buttons, that's about it.If it's just me, I do sometimes 'cook' raw foods in the microwave, like broccoli, brussels sprouts, rice, oatmeal.  But it's purpose in our house is mostly to reheat leftovers, heat water, reheat coffee.  I look for a microwave that does the reheating with as few button pushes as possible.  Any of the above microwaves will do that, and for less money.If you really will use the sensor cooking, or will often use the presets on this one that don't appears on the others, then it may be worth the extra cost for you.  Otherwise, I would consider one of the other three I noted above instead."
2,It functions find to heat things. My frustration is with the turntable.  It dislodged at the slightest provocative. I'm always having to stop what I'm doing to put it back onto its track. I never had this problem with any other microwave in the  past.I've been meaning to write this review for months but forget in the process of cooking.
5,"quality, works great. Looks good. Perfect size. Arrive in timely manner, nicely packaged.  Typical microwave noise, I'm not bothered by it. Delighted with this perchase. Highly recommend for gifting."
2,This is the first time I had a problem with this service. I need my micro wave
4,Convenient for easy and quick cooking and heating food up.
5,"‎Fantastic! Toshiba ‎ML-EC42P(SS) 4 function Microwave / Air Fryer / Convection / CombinationBefore I get into MY review I'd like to address someone else's review.====================When I was checking out the Microwaves, I stumbled across a review for THIS one that claimed that you couldn't type in the time to microwave, and so were stuck with 1 to 6 minutes, and then you were forced to press the ""More"" or ""Less"" buttons raising or lowering the time by one minute. Or using the ""Start / Play"" button to ad 30 seconds. Limiting the times you can microwave starting at 30 Seconds, 1 to 6:30: .5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5 Minutes. Though you can add more minutes by pressing ""More"". If this were true, this would be a HORRIBLE microwave, as we know that a handful of seconds can be the difference between perfectly cooked food and burned or overcooked food.She doesn't know what she's talking about, obviously didn't read the manual OR EVEN LOOK at the keypad.You CAN work it like she described, though I don't know WHY you'd WANT TO! First, she describes ONLY using the Quick Start buttons, which are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and, if we're being honest, the ""Play"" Button (adding 30 seconds to the total, each time you press it). In conjunction with the ""More"" and ""Less"" buttons, adding or subtracting 1 minute at a time.All of this is explained in the manual.But, if you're not a ""Manual"" kind of person, then you only need to read the keypad. If a person does that, he or she will run into 3 buttons directly above the number-pad:Micro, Conv, and Combo. (With an Airfry button one line underneath the top left row.) With just the lightest application of ""the Little Grey Cells"" a reasonably intelligent child would be able to be able to make these associations:Micro = MicrowaveConv  = ConvectionCombo = Microwave then Convection CookingIf you press the Micro Button, the unit displays, ""00:00:00"" and if you start typing in the time that you want, it will start filling up time by inserting each new number at the right-most spot. So if you type ""100"" the unit will display ""00:01:00"", and if you add a number 2 the display will show ""00:10:02"", or 10 Minutes and 2 Seconds. As you can see, it's not too complicated.Review review is over. My review continues below.The ‎ML-EC42P(SS) is a fantastic machine!I had some concerns about this machine:1) Microwave is only 1,000 Watts. Danger of under-cooking. More and more foods say they ""Require"" 1,200 Watts,2) Air Fryer might be wimpy.3) Some reviews say the manual is confusing.PROS:1) Manual isn't bad. I've read MUCH WORSE. Just read it a few times, and keep it handy for referring to it when you're confused.2) That it is a 1000 Watt oven is rarely an issue. But when it is, you can extend the time by a few seconds, or minutes.3) Air Fryer does a really decent job! Sometimes it takes MORE time than using the microwave (for instance, ""Hot Pockets"") would be. But it's a ""Set-it and Forget-it"" deal, and produces MUCH better results. (For instance, microwaving 2 Hot Pockets takes 2 or 3 minutes, while ""Airfrying"" takes about 13 minutes. But, the unit turns itself off after it's done.4) The Convection function can either heat to a specific temperature (Press: Conv->Set Temperature->Play->Play), OR it can cook for a SPECIFIC length of time (Press: Conv->Set Temperature->Play->Type in Time to Cook->Play).5) Auto Defrost works like a charm!CONS:1) Flat, smooth, bubble Keys / Buttons kind of to press / find. No bumps or lines to distinguish where they start or stop. I slide my finger across the button I want to press. 95% success.2) Only 1000 Watts.3) Keypad NOT backlit.4) Keypad / Display can be hard to read.4) Not smart."
1,"I had it for two days and used it less than 10 times. I was timing something and it started to smell like burning plastic and just turned off. When I touched it, the whole outside of it was very hot. I had to pack it up and send it back."
1,"Don't let the outer dimensions of the microwave fool you, the inside is tiny.  I had a 10-15 year old microwave before this that was smaller over all than this but way bigger on the inside. Not to mention it was 700 watts and it would heat up things faster than this.Heat up a thawed litlte microwave pizza. 700 watts takes 3 minutes. This 900 Watt one , takes 5 minutes and the cheese in the middle still isn't fully melted.Just heated up some frozen stuff, half the plate was still frozen solid while the other half was boiling hot.I would not recommend this to anyone. In fact I won't buy black and decker microwaves again because of this."
5,"This microwave is a great value for the price. Easy operation. Cooks great. I previously had a higher wattage microwave and was skeptical about going to a lower wattage.  But, my cooking needs changed, so I thought I would give it a try. And, behold it cooks just as good. I love it."
4,I was disappointed in the crumpled box. The damage to the microwave appears to be minor and in places not noticed. Have not yet used.  Is there a rule that all electronics no matter where they are from have to be punted before delivery can be made?
1,"Bottom crushed, paper thin aluminum, returning.Noisy weak oven. Turn table falls off drive when removing food. Turn table support ring is junk, weighs about 3 grams!"
2,Was never very powerful but just straight up does not heat food anymore after 4 months of using it only a few times a week to reheat leftovers. I wanted a small white microwave and it checks those boxes but it’s not a quality product
2,"Super disappointed that the microwave didn’t last even 2 and a half years. It died right after the 2 year warranty, so there’s nothing I can do except toss it out and get a new one."
3,work well but starting to smoke
2,It had a dent when we first opened it up so returned it.
1,"I've had this microwave 13 months and the inside is rusting. I bought this one to replace a Sears microwave that lasted 20 years with not a speck of rust. I am disappointed and now I have to buy yet another, but NOT this brand!"
4,Does the job
4,"I liked the look but the issue is when opening it, it slides.  Not a good feature, put some rubber on the base and maybe this issue is solved"
5,"Easy to use, I especially like the reheat sensor!"
3,"It’s hard to see the menu. Dark letters on a dark surface. The dinging doesn’t stop when you open the door. When you push the button to open, it pops open then closes noisily."
5,"This unit is great.  Super compact, one plate capacity  but does everything you need it to do.  I really like the ""one button"" touch feature.  Press 1 unit goes in for  one minute.  Press 2 unit goes on the 2 minutes.  Very intuitive."
1,"Product was bent coming out of the box. And it barely heats food. Low powered, even for a 700w microwave. Wish I hadn’t bought it. Should have returned if immediately."
2,"How does this microwave have such good reviews?It doesn't even have a basic light!The door doesn't open when I push the button, it just unmatched until I pull the door with my other hand."
4,"I really like this microwave oven. The only negative comment regards the Air Frying option. I had read that air frying was a more healthy way of preparing foods that normally would be deep-fried. Seeing this option on this Toshiba model, the air-frying capability drove my purchase decision. The problem is that I didn't know anything about air-frying foods e.g. the how to part. I expected some kind of instructions in the instruction manual. The only instructions for air-frying were in the ""Air Fry Chart"". It shows 10 food options with corresponding Display Settings, H1-H10. That's it. Toshiba should add more information about the button-pushing sequence, what cooking utensils to use, and at least one pictorial example for the whole process. After researching Air-frying on the internet, I realized that air-frying in a microwave oven is somewhat different than using a ""dedicated"" air frying machine. I have no problem with this but if the processes and results are somehow different, that information should be included in the instruction manual. So far, there is nothing ""wrong"" with this microwave oven; it just needs some additional instructions for the Air-Frying capability."
4,I like that it has a turn table which my 30 year relic did not have. It is easy to use.
5,"This is a great product.  The Digital Microwave Oven with Turntable Push-Button Door by BLACK+DECKER performed great!  It is compact, easy to use, readable bright digital menu display and it's performance with heating up food products is outstanding!"
1,product arrived boxed just fine.  Once opened and plugged in we noticed one of the peg holding up the microwave was uneven.  The rotary plate did not fit the peice that it sat on and it made an awful noise when it was in use.  The glass plate broke within 2 weeks of purchasing this item.  I'd give a negative star if possible.  Extreemly unhappy to have paid 60 dollars for this low quality item.
4,"If we hadn't received Amazon's usual High level of customer service, this would have been a 2 or less star.  We generally like the microwave.  I like the alternative ""end of cooking"" tone it uses.  I like the Echo linking.  That sort of thing.  But our first oven worked great - for 3 days.  Just long enough that we recycled the box, and threw away the old oven (it's opening button was barely working).  Amazon was great about sending out a new oven within 3 days.  Problem there?  Box came with a hole gashed in it, and side of oven was dented.  It still worked though. We were tired of messing with this, so asked for, and received a sizable discount in the price.  For that, I feel okay about it.  Now if it keeps working (only been 2 days) I'll be very happy.  The binding to Alexa part is tricky.  I almost called in.  Finally found that the instructions were faulty right at the end.  You do join the oven to your home wifi, then look for the oven in the Alexa App.  Just don't connect the phone to the oven's wifi link.  Not necessary.  I'll write back if we have problems, but in general, this is a nice, powerful microwave and I like playing Star Trek with the controls!"
3,It works really well better than any other microwave ive ever used but holy cow this thing is loud
1,"It was fine at first until it stopped working after 2 months. It turns on and lights up as if it is working, but it no longer warms the food. It's too late for me to return it too. Not to mention it's so heavy I can't simply ship it somewhere. DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE; spend the extra $ on something of decent quality."
5,The food is so much easier to open and less likely to stop working like the push button type door
4,I didn’t get to use the item. It was very dented so I purchased a different name brand elsewhere. I do like the look of this particular microwave and it seems made very well. I didn’t have time to wait for another to be delivered. The feet weren’t set right so the microwave was very wobbly.
4,"This is a good machine, it is simple to use and works as expected.I have two minor complaints.First - the push button door latch takes a bit of force to push it in, this causes the unit to slide backwards. This is annoying when it is sitting on a free standing rack and your second hand is holding what you want to heat up.Second - For some reason when this machine is running it interferes with my WiFi. Therefore I can't use it while streaming."
3,"The microwave works fine and looks nice, but it is only 700 watts, which is not mentioned anywhere in the description. Another reviewer said it was 1000 watts which is the reason I ordered it."
1,Won't ever buy GE again. Missing parts and they won't respond to my email. So they may think they got away with something but they lost a good customer.  And Amazon - thanks for nothing for help with this. I won't forget your useless customer service either.
3,I was shocked and disappointed that the microwave was somehow lopsided and wobbly. I had to put something underneath one of the legs so it wouldn't wobble anymore.
4,"It’s a microwave, plugged it in and worked."
4,It was easy to use and arrived on time. Great little microwave!
1,Does not heat very well.
5,"My roommate and I share a house. This is perfect for us as our old one died while almost catching fire. It is smaller, but fits our large plates fine, wouldn’t fit bigger than a large dinner plate. The wattage is 700 so have to cook things just a little longer. Glad I found this deal."
4,"Super nice, metallic finish . No scratches observed, and the tint hides the inside until it's turned on. The only problem I've had with the product is that the glass plate doesn't have any notches to secure it to the plastic turning piece so it tries to secure itself in the first few seconds of turning but eventually turns smoothly. Worth the price and it's compact but not too small . I love the microwave and it appears to be more expensive than it is."
3,"Low wattage of 700.  Timing buttons over 5 minutes don’t work. If cooking directions call for 7 minutes, you need to cook for 4 and then 3 minutes.  It was on sale for a reason."
1,"BOUGHT THIS MICROWAVE B/C IT SEEMED A PERFECT FIT. TO WARM UP FOOD, IT TAKES 5 MINUTES FOR IT TO MAKE IT A LITTLE WARM. IF YOU WANT IT TO HEAT UP YOUR FOOD, THEN YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT 10 MINUTES OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT HEAT UP A SINGLE THING. DO NOT BUY THIS!! IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!!"
5,I am very pleased with it. Works well and looks nice
5,"First it looks beautiful! Very powerful and easy to use. Heats up frozen foods quickly and thoroughly. Presets are huge time savers! Excellent quality! I’ve had Panasonic professional microwaves in the past as they were made available to me through work and they lasted forever. This time when I was looking to purchase, I actually looked for the Panasonic brand and I’m not disappointed."
1,"BEWARE!  ""Programmed Obsolescence!""  This oven worked great for the first year.  However, just at the 12 and 1/2 month anniversary, the ""start button"" stopped working.  We adjusted by just hitting a number on the number pad and that would start the oven to cook for that number of minutes.  It eliminated the possibility of cooking something for say, exactly 30 seconds, and now we need to ""babysit"" the microwave so things don't over cook.  Since then, other buttons have started to break.  It's a bummer.  I hate to have to ""dump"" this oven because I HATE the thought of adding to a landfill, but it just isn't built to last.  Returning it seems like it's not an option now that it's 13 months and 15 days post purchase.  At least a Bed, Bath, and Beyond you can take a product back for up to a year, no questions asked."
3,I needed a small machine for a confined space. Under powered but adequate for my needs
1,I bought this for multipurpose use as microwave and as a Air fryer but it’s just a microwave it doesn’t work as a Air Fryer. It Air fries at only one corner and food burnt at that corner and the food remained uncooked at other corner of the tray. Very disappointed with this purchase. Just the waste of money.
3,"I really like the look of this microwave. The white and stainless steel was exactly what I wanted. At 1000 watts it is high performance. While running, it is very loud and there are not many options to heat specific items. I am sure those would come with a more expensive model. I like being able to personalize the beeping reminder which this unit does not have. To sum it up for the price it is a good value and a decent microwave. Only downside would be the loudness. Also, this takes up the counter space above a full size dishwasher. Just to give an idea of space requirements."
3,"I've only had the microwave a month or so and it's a functioning microwave - no complaints there. It does seem to be a little loud when using the microwave function, but it's not horrible. The browning plate that comes with the microwave was bent and is barely usable. I contacted Amazon and they contacted the manufacturer who said the part is not available and may never be available. Not sure how that is even possible? Amazon recommended they send another microwave and take the browning plate from that one and send the other back. Surprise, surprise, the second one was even worse than the first. I appreciate Amazon's customer service trying to help, but I'm disappointed with Toshiba not having replacement parts for items they sell. This microwave wasn't cheap - but now I have a bent, busted looking browning plate that won't sit flat in the microwave. I doubt I'll even use it. Long story short, it's decent, just wish all the parts were usable."
4,I like the good fit for the corner of a counter just tried it today. Worked fine. Also it’s an attractive unit that resembles Kitchen Aid  Would never buy Kitchen Aid products again. Expensive and don’t last
5,This is a really good quality microwave that has minimal noise and works amazingly as well as has a brightly lit interior.
5,"I absolutely love this microwave! It has so many great features and the ones I love the most are the reheat button. You just press reheat and start and it automatically knows exactly when your food is the right temperature! Same with the defrost button. I have never been able to defrost meat in a microwave without The edge is getting all browned and cooked. This microwave defrosted perfectly just like if you left the meat out to defrost naturally! Not one bit of ground meat on it. My son at the last minute decided he wanted tacos so I had to defrost 2 pounds of chop meat. Seven minutes later it was perfectly defrosted as if I had left it out overnight! If you are hesitating about buying this microwave, don’t! Buy it and you will be thrilled!"
4,Does everything I was hoping for. And the 1100 watt power cooks food pretty fast and effectively. The defroster isn't bad either. Lucky I got it on sale. A good buy.
1,"I purchased this microwave to replace the same looking model, 2 years older, that we loved. The door doesn't open properly.Additionally, Panasonic has downgraded their models, not including the following on this microwave, as compared with the one two years ago:1) Deleted feature that allow you to turn off the 5 beeps every time it turns off.2) Deleted ability to see the power level on the display while operating, no matter what button your press.3) Deleted on white models, the white inside of door and screen; they are now black.4) Deleted the large incandescent light, to a very tiny DAYTIME LED light, that hits you in the eye if standing anywhere left of the door release, even when the door is closed.I called Panasonic customer service and they agreed that many features were omitted. I am in my 30 days to return to Amazon, but these reasons do not allow me to return free of charge, and it would not be worth my paying for return shipping, it's huge and 30 lbs.-- More Than Disappointed"
5,what i like - easy to use. Easy to set up in under a minute. Heats quick and cooks well.what i hate - so far nothing just got it today :)
3,"Closing of the door is loud and as it runs, it is loud as well."
4,"This is a fine microwave oven.  Some of the negative comments in earlier reviews I didn't find problematic.  For example, the light inside the microwave is sufficiently bright and the noise level is fine.  The big problem is that the microwave generator is poorly shielded so that when the microwave is turned on my wireless internet system cuts out... every time.  This was not the case with my previous microwave.  There are a couple other more minor problems.  One has to push the buttons fairly hard to set times, turn the microwave on, etc.  This results in the oven being pushed backwards, and every couple days I have to reposition it.  The weirdest problem is that if one heats something, decides it needs another minute, and restarts the oven... nothing happens until ""reset"" is pushed (this despite the oven is off).  This ""feature"" only lasts for a minute (after which the oven can be started as usual), but it is crazy that the designers would build this in.  No doubt they found a cheap chip and went with it."
2,"Wonderful MW to start with. then, after a couple months use, it started developing intermittent shut-off issues. Fine, went to the support website shown in the user manual: tried to find a service center from the site—website would not accept the model number nor would 'Chat with a Live Agent work (error message from browser: can't connect to server). Over nineteen minutes on hold for the Support phone line: with frequent automated reminders that the "" [best way` to get] faster service is to go to the website"" . Phone answered after 21 minutes on hold: agent was helpful and easily gave me the information that I needed for a service center to get warranty repair done.Panasonic needs to actually have support options available to consumers without extreme efforts to obtain support. Quality of product is very good, customer support in case of a problem is substandard."
5,"I learned a long time ago do not waste your time on 700-900 watt microwaves.Spend another 50 bucks and go for over 1000 watt so things COOK FAST. This 1100 watt cooks fast. And very even heat with the turntable. Happy with it.I do wish all the programing was simpler, but I'm sure I'll learn if I need to.It does say push 1 thru 9 to get 1 minute through 9 minutes full power 10, so that is easy and probably all I'll ever use : )"
2,This past week started to get too much smoke comng out of the inside vent also making a loud sound not every day but maybe every other day.
5,I found this model study and reliable to be used in our busy office kitchen.  I bought a second one when the other brand model quit working.  Definitely would buy again.
3,"As just a small microwave it does pretty good, but it doesn't follow many Alexa commands, including the ones printed inside the door.  Ask it to microwave 8oz of butter and it asks you how long, want popcorn? you better know how many grams you want.  Ask it to reheat a dinner plate and it asks how many? as if more than one could even fit inside.  I just push the buttons now because the alexa features just don't work"
3,"It blew the fuse and stoped working on the microwave setting. It was nice while it lasted, but did not last nearly long enough (under two years). The over function was nice, but I didn’t use it as much as I thought I would."
1,"I used it occasionally for 6 months, and it literally caught into flames."
5,"Small, compact and works just fine. If you do not have a lot of room and dint use a microwave for every mea or ""cooking"" this should be sufficient. I do not believe it would be suitable for using it for more than warming up."
1,We bought this 3 years ago. After about 2 years it started to look like it was rusting on the inside. Well it definitely was melting? Not sure why or how but I'm sure this was one minute away from being a fire hazard. A microwave is supposed to last longer than 2 years but it also took double the time to cook something that instructions said it did.
4,"Without a traditional number pad, it's slightly more annoying to use than a regular microwave, but that piece of it wasn't enough to sway me from buying it. Would I prefer a number pad? Yes. But this works just fine. It matches my kitchen perfectly and the slightly smaller design is exactly what I wanted. I bought this with the Keenstone retro toaster in the same beige color and they look great together."
1,"The media could not be loaded.I might have rated this microwave a lot higher, but I just can't get over that there is no way to set the clock.  This problem has been reported in the reviews and the questions several times in just the last month or so.  But when you call Toshiba support they don't seem to know anything about it and just tell you to return it and get another one.  I did, and I have the same issue with the second one.  Several sections of the instructions are written in broken English.  And to add insult to injury, they have the #DetailsMatter all over everything.  (Yes they do, Toshiba!  Please proof read your instructions and test all functions when you do software updates!)"
2,"This unit works ok so far but not as good as the older comparable unit it replaced.Had a very similar 1300w Panasonic unit that finallly died.Loved the old unit and decided to stay with the brand, but very disappointed after first use of this oven.Threw in a bag of Popcorn to test it and it came out burnt.Trying the lower setting for smaller bags and it came out underpoppped.Other Food seems to heat normally but a first impression fail.Overall quality seems to be off from what it was on the old unit.Perhaps it is the way of the world, whats in a name? Rebranded partnerships, and the quality gets cashed out."
4,"This is a nice, quiet, large microwave. It is easy to use and heats the food well. For some reason, the turntable keeps coming off track, but other than that I love it."
1,"Digital display is the only thing that lights up.  Preset buttons and keypad do not light up.  Air fryer is very poor.  Air fryer is basically the convection oven with a fan.  Air fryer and convection oven get dangerously hot.  Air fryer and convection oven are very loud and lasted just 5 months.  The only thing that still works is the microwave.  Purchased this item to save space and it failed miserably.  Now I have a boat anchor microwave and I had to go purchase an air fry and convection oven.  Bought cheap Black and Decker and the work so much better than the Toshiba when it was new.  Unfortuately, I could not give a lower star rating than a 1.  In conclusion, the Toshiba is pure junk!!!!"
3,I like but its a little too small
4,Work great just don't like when i opened the box it  have a dent on the left side
2,I have only owned this microwave for approximately 8 months and now cannot be used because there is an electrical storm inside if turned on. It occurred when I tried to melt butter in a glass dish as I have done many times before.
5,"Owned one for 30 years, this new one is as good as uso."
2,"The media could not be loaded.Farberware and Toshiba microwave units are basically using the same faulty parts.After about 1 month with the Farberware unit, I am noticing that the moisture sensor will randomly engage, lowering the power level to 8. My food is then not fully cooked, creating the danger of eating undercoked or partially raw food.Over 1 year ago I had purchased a highly rated Toshiba model. The moisture sensor was intermittently activated, lowering the power setting, resulting in undercooked food. Finally the main board developed an intermittent short sometimes causing the unit to reset.I finally emailed Toshiba, but could not get a response for repair or replacement. :-(So, I decided, no more Toshiba products.I purchased this Farberware unit. When I received it, to my surprise, it looked quite familiar. After inspecting the unit, reading the manual, and taking some measurements, I determined that the Farberware unit is reusing 90% of the Toshiba parts! It is definitely reusing the main circuit board and firmware.If you own a recent Farberware or Toshiba microwave of this type, make sure your food is cooking fully."
3,The glass was everywhere and returned to UPS. however no receipt
5,The media could not be loaded.Was able to use MW practically right out of the box. Compact and easy to use. Absolutely recommend this product. I love it!!
3,Pay attention to the size of the inside when making a microwave purchase. This wouldn't even accommodate a large dinnerplate. I returned it.
5,"I was looking for a new microwave because I haven't brought one in a long time. When I saw this one, I was in love. My son decided he was going to pay for it for me as a gift. It goes well with my kitchen because I have a black fringe, stove so it goes well. It's quite and the perfect size and fix's perfect in my microwave stand. I'm loving it."
3,"Its clean/ nice looking.  Small, but large enough to handle large dinner plates for reheating multiple portions.  Very noisy compared to the ~7ish y/o appliance I replaced, even with ample space on the sides (3+in) to provide breathing room for the appliance."
2,"The microwave looks great, worked great for 5 months. Now, it is making horrible grinding and squealing noises when used. Of course, the ""support window"" is closed for this purchase, so we are left high and dry to figure it out on our own. Very disappointed that this product broke so quickly, when we don't utilize it very heavily. It's a very pretty paperweight now."
4,"Doesn’t take up much space, light weight, easy to use. The only negative is it is lower power so you have to get used to microwaving for more time if you used to have a bigger one. But it’s easy and good!"
4,"The microwave itself is very nice. It looks great alongside the rest of my kitchen. It is a temporary fix until I remodel and have one built in.The negative is how loud it is. The door rattles when it is on and it seems to shake more than I'm used to for a microwave. I thought it was the glass tray inside doing it, but it wasn't. To get it to stop you have to put heavy pressure on the door handle and hold it until it is done.It isn't enough of a problem for me to fret too much over it, but I know for some this could be too much of an annoyance."
3,"great microwave, only problem is i have to wipe the moisture down after every use. otherwise it will start to stink and drip out water everytime you try to use. other than that it’s great."
5,"I like that it is small and meets my needs.  The crisp mode is really nice to have for reheating pizza, hot dogs, wings, etc.  No more soggy or exploding reheats.  Also it looks really nice.  Especially like the way the controls turn off when not in use.  It is quiet compared to my old machine."
1,"Lasted just days shy of 4 years. It seems like all appliances have turned into temporary, short term use, throw away, plastic junk."
2,"It’s huge and incredibly powerful. I went from a 700 watt built-in to this 1250 watt monster. Having said that, I see so many bad reviews that now I’m nervous about whether it’ll last or not. So far I’m happy. If anything changes I’ll update. Update: After using it for awhile now I think something's wrong. To soften a stick of butter I set it on 10% power for 25 seconds. I got butter soup. To defrost 2 salmon filets I set it for sensor defrost. In less than a minute the salmon was completely cooked. I know that's not right. So I tried defrosting a hamburger patty (1/3 lb). I set defrost for 1/3 pound and got a cooked burger. So it won't soften, it won't defrost, which are the things I use a microwave for the most often. It seems to only have one setting - high. ☹"
5,Nice and compact. Intuitive controls. Quiet.
4,"This replaced a 15 year old microwave with lesser wattage. I thought that I would need to use less time to make tea and cook items but not so. Everything needs more time plus I’m using the highest power setting. Knowing this, it works fine."
3,I cannot get the glass plate inside level for the life of me! Therefore results in a jump of the platewhile the microwave is running......annoying.
4,I needed a microwave big enough to cook a 13 lb Turkey
1,"I'm confused why this microwave wasn't properly inspected , as it arrived broken. I want a replacement because this is unacceptable."
2,I bought this last November.  It has worked well for me until just recently.  It has started making some really strange sounds and is definitely breaking.  I've gone back to using my old microwave which was here in 1996 when I bought the house and still works.  I expect a microwave to last longer than 11 months.
3,"Works very well.  Major issue is steam captured in the microwave itself. After each use, I need to wipe down the door and soak up puddles of water under the turn-tray."
3,"I am huge Panasonic fan, but other than the clock and the timer, I could  not get the microwave to do anything else.  I do not know if it was the ""child protection"" feature that I could not circumvent, or some step that I either I had added or that I had omitted.  I asked two of my nieces who are much more tech savvy than I to try their luck.  They got the same result!!I became extremely frustrated and decided to return it."
2,No user manual!  Needs printed list of auto-cook codes and instructions for convection and broiler features.
5,Owned it for about a month now.Exactly what I was looking for. Very happy with the microwave. The sensor cook stuff requires you to remember which number is which for what items but over all not to hard to remember the 2 items I typically cook. It is high power and cooks much faster than my older microwave.The inverter defrost works fantastic. I always had to defrost items because my wife would end up half cooking them. The sensor defrost on this microwave works really well in her opinion.It is large. I wanted large. Make sure you note the depth of this microwave.The Black will collect fingerprints since it doesn't have a handle. My wife and I have developed a way of closing it with the back of our hand that keeps the front fingerprint free. Just took a while to stop grabbing it looking for a handle.
5,This is a great microwave for the price! It had no reviews for me to compare so I took a chance on this one. Very happy with my purchase!
4,"I thought all, microwaves were the same, buzzer sound, wrong, I was looking for 1000 watt microwave, saw the price on this model, neglected looking at wattage, bought it, and still sadly, use it."
5,"I purchased this because I moved into a rental in another state while my husband remained behind to await a transfer and sell our house. I needed something reasonable in price and smaller since it would be just me and sitting on a counter. This fit the requirements.Seven years later we still use it, its a great microwave, it still works as new and does what it was intended for; heat up food quickly. For those saying its too small, I fit large glass Pyrex bowls, full sized dinner plates etc. in it, what are these people trying to cook in a microwave 15lb turkeys, whole roasts? As long as the width/circumference is the size of a round dinner plate and it fits on the round glass turn table you're good!Its as quiet as any other microwave and it is easy to use. It does take a bit longer to use (seconds) since its less wattage - just be aware, but its not difficult to adjust times.For the price, counter footprint and longevity this is well made and worth buying!"
1,"We have been without a microwave for a couple of weeks and imagine our disappointment when the new microwave arrived like this.It wasn’t packaged properly. It has dents and scratches on it. It was dirty inside with black marks. Also, some of the parts had popped off inside. One of the small legs is missing and the microwave leans to one side. This is going back!"
2,"So I bought this microwave September 2019 and it's been a decent microwave. After owning it for about a year noticed the top bubbling and rusting as mentioned by other reviewers, but a real deep scrubbing got rid of the rust and just kept going with it. At around the 2 year mark the light inside stopped working and every once in a while will light up intermittently and really dim but pretty much only when you open the door. I'd say the rust issue is concerning to say the least, but the light not coming on when you are microwaving something you need to watch to make sure it doesn't boil over is kind of a deal breaker on this microwave. I can't honestly recommend this microwave even with the low price tag."
5,It's an awesome microwave for the price. It eats fast and you barely hear the noise. It also was bigger than I thought.
2,"This microwave is almost perfect but one seemingly minor flaw is so shortsighted that it ruins the experience. This microwave is quiet, the sensor cook works well and everything else seems great. What’s that flaw I spoke of? IF YOU SET A KITCHEN TIMER NO OTHER FUNCTIONS CAN BE USED! That’s right. You’re in the kitchen trying to multitask cooking on the microwave and maybe you need a timer for the oven or something else. Don’t even bother using the one on the microwave. Guess you need to get a time machine and go buy one of those old school plastic kitchen timers."
1,"It worked great at first, until one day it completely stopped turning on, the power plug is hard to put in small spaces, it is a terrible waste of money, and when trying to refund it even though I barely owned it they wouldn’t even give me full credit back or replace it with the same model. I would stay far away from this microwave."
4,I haven't used the air fryer yet but microwave and convection oven are easy to use.
2,"It looked nice and heated foods well.  I liked that the beeps could be switched off.  But it only lasted 3 years where my previous microwaves lasted 10+ years, and that sucks."
2,"Bought this bc needed a microwave & wanted to also try/use an airfryer. This was advertised as a combination microwave & airfryer.  Got it delivered & proceeded to read the instruction manual closely looking specifically for airfryer! Only 2 references pg 12 (the control panel picture showing where the airfryer button is located) and bottom of pg 19, a small chart in the 14. POPCORN Operation section. Airfrying does NOT have its own section in the manual! It has almost ZERO information about this feature which is advertised as a primary feature! I called the ""help"" customer service & got no help, in fact the rep didn't seem to even UNDERSTAND what information I needed! I need a microwave & it's too much trouble to box up & send back, but if I knew this before I ordered it, I would NOT have bought it!!"
4,"This is a terrific little oven, very compact really easy to use. A little bit noisy which was the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars."
4,"Purchased this as a replacement and installed it ourselves.  Fair price and a good size.  Installation went okay but when securing the microwave to a top shelf, the top front screws, the frame shell lifted in one side no one will probably notice except me.  The removable shelf does not allow the space for a coffee mug to be heated without removing the shelf.  1,000 watts seems to be adequate.  Controls are easy to operate and read."
2,My mother received the item defective. The glass plate is doesn’t spin and makes a weird noise. She’s still waiting for the credit even though she returned the microwave on Monday 2.
1,"I purchased this microwave Feb 2019.  The light bulb went out. Replaced it.  Went out again w/i one day.  OK, no light w/i the microwave.  But it is now July 2021 and the entire unit is kaput.  I reset the wall electrical fixture.  The microwave fizzed and went completely out.  Hmmm, I then reset the wall electric fixture again.  Nope, nothing.  The microwave is out completely.  Only good for trash barrel.  Or recycle.  I would not purchase this item again.  And, oh, yeah, when this micro was working, I agree w/ others that the damn 5 BEEP sound warning is so damn annoying.  The 5 beeps will not stop even when opening the door."
5,"Perfect basic countertop microwave oven.  Not for doing raw steaks 🥩 etc — but GREAT for reheating them, and coffee, pasta, etc"
3,"This microwave has accurate capacity as advertised.  It has a very good power level and distribution. Controls are easy to operate. However, there are three design deficiencies in this Microwave: 1- the door only opens 90 degrees; the door could potentially get damaged during food in and out. The door should be designed to open wider up to 180 degrees.  2- when a power level is selected, the selected power level is not shown on the display during the entire cooking time.  The display should be designed to show power level at all the time for ease of use and those who may not remember what power level has been selected.  3- the housing frame specially the top should be stronger or thicker metal.  It clicks when an item of a few lbs. are placed on the top.  For these three reasons I have dropped my rating to 3 stars."
5,Es un poco pequeño yo pensaba que era un poco más grande pero funciona bastante bien
2,"I. had to replace our old microwave oven. I thought I would try one with an air fry option. I really wanted this combination to work. 1st, the operating panel has a highlighted air fry button, but the manual did not mention air frying at all. 2nd, the manual is practically worthless, with only brief discussion of the functions and how to use them. Manuals from other manufacturers. include detailed instructions, including suggestions as how to. cook various items. Third, there is no air fry basket for smaller items. They must be placed on a tray, which restricts air flow around the food. 4th, the control panel is difficult to read, except under bright light. The fonts used on the panel are too thin. Yes, I did remove the protective plastic from. the panel. Will return."
1,"I got this item  on April 28 and on October  23 ( only 6 months after ) the function  to open did not work , so... I called to the factory and I was told: "" we don't  sell microwaves"". by luck Amazon refunded me certain amount ."
4,"This microwave gets the job done, and is surprisingly powerful. It does not take up much counterspace,but as a tradeoff it can't fit larger plates. Though stadard size paper plates fit just fine. This microwave will start without pressing cook/go/enter, because if say you press 1 it will assume you want to cook for 1 minute. This feature can be useful but it takes some getting use to. If you want to put in a very specific time you have to press time cook then enter your desired time, then press start. Other than that issue, this is a quality little machine that looks fairly stylish."
1,Received the item and the glass was broken. Not useable and have to wait another week for a microwave. Not happy at all
5,Works perfectly and gets hot quickly.
1,This takes the soggy slop out of microwave food!  I cook using “combo mode”where it grills as well as zap and it does a good job of it! Perfect size for fitting nice size items as well...2 snaps in a circle!
5,Replaced a large microwave with this smaller one. Did not need frills. I just use it for heating. Light enough to store hidden away and pull out when needed.  Works great.
5,Perfect size for a bag of popcorn or a large plate. It’s quiet and has a nice long cord. Love the red retro look!
4,Small but decent power and basic functions. Looks nice and easy to operate. The best feature is being able to turn off the annoying beeps when using buttons or finishing a cooking cycle. I would recommend this microwave.
1,I don't recommend this product the microwave doesn't cook food thoroughly and the middle of meals are left frozen
3,This is a nice little microwave but it definitively takes longer than others. In my other apartment I might put something in for 1 minute. In this one it almost doubled — 2 mins for the same dish.
2,Fault advertising it is not what I go compair to the immage .It is not a Miro door.
4,Excellent Product for the price - Purchased for office use - Staff surprised by how quite is runs
1,"I have had Panasonic microwaves for as long as I can remember.  At least 45 years.  But, I will think twice before I get another one.1.  It burns everything.  Doesn’t matter if I use timed cooking or sensor reheat.  I have to babysit it in order to keep from setting off the smoke alarm.2.  In order to turn the light off, the door has to be closed.  But, if the door is closed, them the moisture can mildew.3.  The push button door is really hard to open.  They need to go back to the handle on the door.I will be trying a different manufacturer."
5,"This order came on time as promised and it fits perfectly in the space for it.  it is easy to clean.  Also very easy to use.  I'm still learning all the things it can do but so far microwave and air fryer are perfect.  Only wish they had given a little recipe book and instruction manual because my printer's not working so I can't print up anything on line.  Air fryer foods come out perfect and microwave is very, very good. Also I like the way the Air Fryer operation stops and tells you it's time to turn the food over so you don't have to watch the clock.  Quiet operation and when food is finished it warns you that it's hot when you open the door.  Also it makes a little bird type chirp when the cooking is finished.  Prefer that to those ear shattering ones that some appliances have. Looks good too. Definitely made a big difference in my wanting to cook."
5,Easy to operate. Looks great in my kitchen
1,Not working when delivered
4,The Panasonic microwave came on time and was exactly the right size and seems to work pretty well. But at first it occasionally seemed to make more noise then it should have when it was running. It has since stopped doing that. I'm hoping that it will continue to work well. So far it works great.
5,"Okay, I don't want to write a long pro-con type review on all the super nice features that this micro has to offer. The last micro we had lasted foryears but was a cheapie, only the most basic of functions,  and, until my wife (that did an excellent job picking this one out btw) I had no idea how much microwaves have advanced. It does a TON of delightfull stuff that I wouldn't even have thought of; there are so many, wbere would I begin.. um.. here's one in particular: Sensor reheat (just pop something in there push fhe button, and this mw heats it to perfect temprature and consistency, with no guessing or even thinking about it.. So. Cool. Also, it's HUGE. Cavernous even. I love it, but if space is an issue for you, you might want to double check the dimensions before choosing this ginormous microwave. So, there ya go. We've used it for about a month, and it's a keeper. Oh, and it is so user friendly -you don't feel like you're programming a mw that's for NASA. I haven't found one single thing that I don't like about this micro... Except for the fact that it is, unfortunately, probably NOT made in America."
5,"I purchased the Black & Decker microwave oven to replace my previous one, which developed a rather serious problem (smoke while cooking an item and a bright white flash while the oven was running)after 21 years. I ordered my new B&D microwave immediately after my old one failed, and have not had one bit of trouble with the B&D oven since (I have owned the new B&D microwave about three weeks or so as I write this).This is my second B&D purchase in the last few years (I have a B&D one-cup coffeemaker, my second one, which replaces my first one after the latter failed after five years or so due to what I believe was a welded thermostat), and I intend to stay with B&D for my home appliance purchases from this point forward.Black and Decker is, in my opinion, one of the best home appliance makers around; I hope they stay in business a long time into the future. As with my last B&D purchase, my hat is off to the company. They really know their business, IMO (in my opinion), when it comes to home appliances. Again, I intend to stay with B&D for my home appliance purchases, now and in the future. These appliances will always have a place in my home."
4,Yes its worksYes its easy to useYes its easy to cleanYes its a good value for the size that it isYes it will DISRUPT the wifi. even a little shield leak will lag the internet when used
2,This unit makes a lot of noise while it is cooking. The plate becomes loose frequently. I would not recommend or buy again.
4,"Great size, seems very solid.  I wish I could find it in white.  Purchased to replace a GE that worked for a decade or more.  Considering returning this due to poor usability.  For example:1. The platter is very hard to seat correctly, and the table won't turn without it.2. The printing on black is difficult to read, and is not lit so one MUST turn on a light at night and on grey days, which was not the case with the white GE microwave.3. The 'finished' beeps do NOT stop if you open the door, making excess noise for no reason.4. The Kitchen Timer works differently than the cooking, not only requiring selecting the timer before entering time, but loading the numbers from right to left, so entering 10 gets you ten seconds, not ten minutes.5. I set the timer, did some other work, came back, hit Start, and the oven started COOKING for 3 minutes.  That has me questioning the integrity of the programming of the chip.In sum, the oven starts TOO easily, the ring to turn the platter shifts (doesn't have a dedicated track) and the platter doesn't sit well making it common for the turntable to fail, and the controls don't work consistently."
1,"This is the third time this has happened with a Panasonic microwave in the past 18 months.  Unit worked fine for the first couple of weeks but now it's only turning on for a couple of seconds and then it shuts off.  I read that Panasonic microwaves have an issue with door latches and that could be the problem, but why should I have to replace the door latches after less than 2 months?  Completely worthless.  Never buying Panasonic again."
5,"Bought this seven years ago and iit just died. Loved it all the time I had it, though I didn't use the bells and whistles much.Mine has the same exact product number, but the dimensions in the manual are slightly different and mine was a 900W microwave. I just added an extra 15 sec to the recommended time on those tv dinners or chose the middle time on the 700-1100W times given and things cooked just fine.(I always check when cooking something to see what the time is based on, usually 1100W, but sometimes more recently 1200W. Again, I just add about 15 extra seconds for the 1100 and a bit more for the 1200.)It got a bit finicky towards the end and I'd have to be persistent to get it to start, but it kept going until it just quit. I guess 7 years isn't too bad these days.I loved the look of it and the removable tray that I could wash now and then. The handle was sleek and comfortable and not too difficult to open, though I did add some non-slip stuff to the feet so I didn't have to worry about it at all. I had it on a glass cutting board so any condensation drip wouldn't ruin the cheap particle board of my microwave cart.The blue timer was easy to read and the clock was easy to set. Some might find it a bit noisy to run, but the sound never bothered me too much. I didn't like to stand right in front of it while it was running though, made my insides feel odd. I liked that the timer was loud enough to hear from the other room, which is generally where I would be while it was cooking, and the repeat allowed me to leave it in the recommended additional minute or so and still know when to get it out and not forget it. My only concern was whether it would bother my roommate if she was sleeping, but she said it didn't. (She's a sound sleeper though.)All in all a good little microwave. I'd recommend it, especially for the price."
5,We bought this to replace an older Panasonic Inverter microwave that was damaged in a storm.  This one doesn't interfere with bluetooth or wifi like the old one did unless you are right in front of it.  It would be nice to have a text scroll in the display (old one had this) for the 1-14 presets it's just a number.  So we printed a small chart and put it on the microwave door.  Ours was bought as a Used - Like New unit for $100 off.  The unit itself arrived fine but the tray ring was loose inside.  Luckily it didn't break from bouncing around during shipping.  The box was beat up with holes in it and the foam busted but forunately no damage.Make sure you take into account the large dimensions of this unit and have the counter space for it before purchasing.
5,"Size, sharp and neat look"
3,too much clearance required.  states 10 inches!
2,I loved the look of this microwave. Definitely would not recommend this. Rattles everytime you use it.
3,For some reason the glass plate began to make a horrible noise when spinning. Like it doesn't fit properly. I had to fold up a paper towel and place under it to make it fit more tightly and quiet it when in use. I hope the paper towel in there being microwaved all the time is okay......
1,"I ordered this microwave when my old one stopped working. Unfortunately, when I first tried to use it I received error ""H98"" on the display. When I did a Google Search for this Panasonic error code, this is what I found; ""H98 means the component that produces the microwaves is fried.""The good thing about buying through Amazon is that they made the return very easy and I was able to return it that day.I may have just gotten the one bad unit in the whole bunch, however, I had to run around that day to find  a replacement unit so I could heat up my elderly dogs' foods in time for dinner. I will say this, the previous microwave that I had was also a Panasonic unit and it lasted over fifteen years. However, this review is only for this particular purchase, so I had to give it a one star."
1,"So small that a plate barely fits. The plate in comes with constantly moves around and it won’t settle in the middle. Takes forever to heat up! It takes about 10 mins to get a small bowl of soup to warm up.  Too late to return, but I will be trashing it and buying a new microwave."
2,"The turntable would not function upon arrival.  Ordered a new turntable motor, which is not easy to locate.  When the replacement motor arrived, removed the plate covering the motor underneath the microwave only to discover the existing motor was disconnected from the wiring harness.  Plugged it in and everything works as expected.  Now I have a 'spare' $40 turntable motor.  Disappointed with the experience."
4,It works well and serves my needs  fine.Good value for the money.
1,"Hello, I wanted to warn everyone that our microwave caught on fire this week while it was warming a cup of coffee. Luckily, I was in the kitchen at the time. We've owned it for 2 years. I called GE just to see what they would say and they acted very interested and grilled me on the circumstances and then told me they could offer me a discounted microwave for the trouble. Their ""discounts"" are more expensive than the Amazon list price. I won't be buying another GE product."
2,"The door only opens 90 degrees, not a full 180 degrees, which is what I had.  Didn't know.  It weighs nothing, so it moves on your counter top when you use it.  I'll have to tape it down to the counter.  The controls are nice and easy to use.  For $119 delivered it's fine.  Unfortunately, it smelt liked burned electrical when I unboxed it and still kind of does when in use.  But for $119 I'm not going to send it back to get a new one."
4,"The media could not be loaded.We bought this microwave about five months ago so it is still new. I like the red color on the front. The sides and back are black and dark gray inside. It cooks well. For example, if I put in a mug of water for a min, it will be hot. Two frozen burritos for two min; it cooks mostly, but the center is not super hot. A can of soup in a glass bowl will heat in about two minutes as well. But the odd thing is it seems to cook more from the bottom when you take it out, and the plate or bowl will be super hot. I read this in other reviews and can confirm that. The sound on other reviews is, I think, a personal preference; it was as loud as my last microwave but louder than my mom's expensive 600$ one. Overall, I recommend this for the price. I got it for 180$. I think it was on sale."
3,I return this item unpacked and unused as I didn't need it.........
2,"bought this back in 2020, everything works 3 years later. But now I have to throw it out because it is starting to RUST. Around the door and the framing the door rests against."
4,I thought it was going to be a little more bigger but its too small for the price.
4,Small footprint and simple to operate. Quality doesn’t look all that great. Door is noisy to open and close. If placed on a granite countertop or any smooth surface it will move every time you open the door. You will have to push the microwave with thumb while opening or use two hands. I ended up getting a silicone mat and now it sits in place. Bad and cheep design for a countertop microwave.
1,"This microwave started making a terrible noise a few months into use, conveniently just days after the return window was finished. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,It is a nice looking  microwave.  It is not the quietest  running microwave  but it's  ok.
3,"Had this a couple weeks and the microwave works fine so far.  I like the reheat sensor feature.  The oven itself is rather flimsy and I don't see any stainless steel on the outside.  It is metal colored but not stainless.  Pushing the buttons causes the oven to move on the counter, and I am not a strong person.  Another reviewer suggested buying the extended warranty as new microwaves break more often, so I did, but have not been able to set it up online.  The warranty problem is not caused by this product but I mention it in case you are considering purchasing one."
5,"Wish they had a bigger one, but works great"
5,Our old microwave suddenly died. It was pretty old anyway. Found this on Amazon and have been very pleased. We've been using in a couple of months. And I can highly recommend it. Controls are easy and it just plain works.
5,"Very nice quality, high end!"
5,"Well built, easy to operate"
2,It is so loud I don't know if there is something wrong. Can't reach the support I need?
2,Looks nice and works okay but interior light stopped working in only 1 week!!!!Disappointed
3,"Try it, might B right for u. Wasn't pked right."
1,It is a noisy microwave. Hums loud. The screws were not all tight when we got it so there for my husband had to tighten them. We are very disappointed.
4,Simple microwave
1,I would absolutely NOT buy this brand again. Every time I use this microwave it sounds like the motor is about to go out- makes a type of knocking rattling sound. Sometimes it won’t heat at all.I wish I didn’t throw away the box so quickly or I would have just returned it.
1,Not dimensions as stated.  Only 19”w not 21.5
3,"While the overall microwave cooks fine and is easy to use --- the door is so dark you can't see inside when the food is cooking.  It's nice and bright when you open the door, but once closed you can barely see inside and can't see the food cooking"
4,Loe noise. Spacious interior
2,"too dam small, this will suspend all buying from AMAZON"
1,It takes a very long time to heat the food up also we have to leave the door open to ventilate because if we don’t it gets wet and smells bad.
2,"You get what you pay for they say. We don't have much use for a microwave, so didn't want to spend a lot, but the poor quality surprised me. Trying to cook some potatoes, 4, and the microwave started to smell like burned plastic. Very scary, can't be healthy at all. Wish I would have started using it as soon as we bought it and notice so that we could return it. One should I least be able to cook potatoes at 9 min at a time without smelling like burnt rubber."
5,"If you’re like I was you’re looking for a small-to-medium size microwave that can evenly heat food with simple, easy to use features and is not annoying. Well I’m really happy with this purchase because it checks all of those boxes.Where it really stands out is how nice it looks. Most other comparable microwaves are ugly and look straight out of the 1980s, but this one looks nice and sleek. Also the “finish” sound is quick and pleasant as opposed to most other microwaves’ obnoxious blaring beeps.The Alexa integration however does not work. I cannot get this microwave to connect to WiFi. But I find the Alexa integration to be rather silly and unnecessary so I’m not disappointed, but if that is something you want then this microwave probably won’t be good for you. Other than that, I definitely recommend this microwave."
3,"This is advertised as a stainless steel microwave. It isn't. The top and sides are solid black. The only stainless is the trim on the front. It is noisy, but that doesn't bother me much. It is also, I'd have to say, flimsy. When I pull the handle to open the door, the whole oven pulls forward. I'm keeping it as it seems to cook more evenly than my old oven. If I could start over, I'd choose something different; but this will do for now."
3,"Had for 1.5 years and it is still working.  Have only used the microwave part of the oven.  The most used parts of the touch screen bubbles.  The film over the screen is raised and loose on the numbers that are used most.  The numbers, start and stop buttons are the worsted because we use them the most."
4,Compact and does exactly what it is supposed do. I would recommend it
5,"We had bought a name brand microwave that ended up lasting less than 2 years. Bought this as a replacement and are very impressed so far. A month in, it reheats and cooks well."
1,If you’re single and want cheap this is for you. Small this is RCA wow
2,"After the paint/lining failed, the microwave produces sparks and is failed."
1,we did not receive the stainless pan or two racks which were to be included.  Please send them asap
4,"2 days old but makes my 12yr old microwave seem like I was trying to microwave food in a tin can over an open fire. I finally have a microwave that states its wattage on the inside of the door in clear print. Absolutely Love my purchase that was ordered with Guaranteed 1 Day Delivery and arrived within 24hrs. It’s Very spacious, looks great and popped perfectly prepared popcorn using the “Popcorn” button and entering the bags oz. This process, using my relic wave, entailed bypassing the Popcorn button(different results each time) and inputting 3mins and having to stand by and listen for the 1-2 sec breaks between pops to still be surprised if the popcorn will be burnt or not or if enough were popped to satisfy a meager appetite.Although there are typos in the instructions it’s still Easy to read and perform the actionsAll in all, my family of 3 couldn’t be happier with our purchase"
5,"So far so good. I do have a Oster toaster oven with convection but needed new microwave, so this is a combo perfection.  However instructions need to be better. I know how these work, but other may be confused.UPDATE: 9/14/23 after a 5 months.MICROWAVE test: did bowl of soup. 2 mins, PERFECTAIRFRYER. Did frozen Walmart Great value chicken Nuggets. Air fryer setting h-5. Use elevated circle rack so it higher up. I purchased circular parchment paper that fit the circular rack perfect with holes in them) https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BPLB694B .  I cut cook time when it reaches 4 minutes left for perfection. crispy - Juicy OMG nuggets.Tip get air fryer parchment sheets. Rounds 6 inch. Use those over the open rack  PERFECTION!!!!!!!!!!!Frys: frozen walmart medium crinkle cut fries. FRICKEN AYE! Better then my old fryer and forget my oven. This thing on open rack made them so perfect I cried while I ate them. Crispy on outside.Tender and HOT! inside.  KISSES MICROWAVE!REMEMBER: NEVER USE METAL COOKING ITEMS IN MICRWAVE MODE!!! only bake - convection or airfry buttons.Microwave strength fine, well i need to do less time on my can of soup and beefaroni, maybe 1:45Airfryer, oh god I wuv you.Baked a pan cake in it on convection oven as well as a bread in bread pan that came out done but moist."
1,"If you decide to buy this microwave based on the written dimensions, don't, it is significantly smaller than advertised. (Please see photographs) it is approx 2 inches smaller L/W, it was advertised at 13.8 x 19.2x 11.2, but it is actually 10 5/16 × 17 11/16 × 11 1/8. It was bought to fit into a designed space."
4,"Nice unit. Has dark gray interior.Wish it was more powerful, but that's my oversight. Takes a little longer to cook."
1,"We bought our microwave in October 2020 and it just broke. This cost me over $200 last year. I have paid less money for microwaves that have lasted years. All the features it said it has, didn’t see any difference when warming my food. We are not heavy microwave users so that’s probably why it lasted a year. All the negative reviews you are reading here are correct. Do not buy this product. Wish I had taken those reviews seriously."
2,Takes way longer to heat thing than regular microwave.  Only positive is its small.
2,Size was perfect for my space but in the last few months the white paint on the inside of the microwave was chipping off in multiple areas; I bought it 9-21 so it's not that old.  Quite disappointed with this microwave.
2,"We have had this microwave for a couple months. Other than not needing to dirty a pot, this does not take any less time than something would on the stove. I am currently waiting for it to reheat my soup. We are at 14 minutes so far. It will not fully pop a bag of popcorn. Unless you have no other option, I would look elsewhere."
3,now and then this microwave screams any ideal why. Should I stop using it?????
5,we've had it one year and it still works great.  Will buy another when this one goes.
3,"The cooking meets expectations.  However, the covering on the keypad is already starting to bubble.  Just an average.  also, the beeper is annoying in that with my previous microwaves when you opened the door the beeper stopped.  With this model, it continues to beep, 5x at least."
4,***UPDATE***  I should share something I've learned over years of using a nearly identical machine.  When you microwave and then grab things out of the oven it is very easy to forget you are convection baking or air frying something.  I have over the years burned myself many times because I reached right in the unit to grab a plate that was actually 400 degrees from baking something.  BE CAREFUL.This convection unit preheats MUCH MUCH faster than the old twin Kenmore unit it replaced.The first unit was delivered warped and would not sit on the counter flat.  The return was simple and easy.  Note that someone else may have returned the unit before I rec'd it since some of the the packaging was missing.The second repalcement unit box was covered with dirt.  I had to tip it over and wipe it down before bringing it into the house.  That aside this microwave/convection oven is easy to use and has great features.  It is IDENTICAL to the old Sears Kenmore unit it replaces except with a different brand label.  It also has the air fry feature that we haven't tried yet but are anxious to  use.  Buttons are easy to navigate and I expect this to work well for us. One new feature I like is after the cook time is done the tray will continue to rotate until it is in the same position you put your food in.  Nice to not have to reach around a steaming hot item to grab a handle.  Then new LED light is very white and bright enough.
5,"I changed out the combo micro range hood for a good solo range hood.  I was not looking forward to a big black box on my counter.. I found this one and was DELIGHTED! I have stainless appliances and white cabinets and this looks great. My combo unit was a quality convection/micro unit (GE Profile) but did not vent well. I was not expecting this unit to compare in function and was I was wrong!.. This unit actually works BETTER.  It is fast, easy to use, easy to clean, and the blue led light looks great. I have not tried the mute function as I don't need to use. Good value for the money."
2,It shifts back when I open it because it doesn't have a handle. the panel is so easily melted that a hot dish already melted part of it just brushing against it
4,"I've seen feedback mentioning the lack of instructions and I've found that to be true. The microwave is relatively self explanatory. The air fryer came with some basic instructions. I didn't see any instructions for the convection oven option and have not used that yet.The air fryer portion works well, maybe not quite as well as a stand alone air fryer, but it definitely does its job."
2,"This microwave is very cute and worked well for a short time. But it wasn't long before it started sparking when I put anything it didn't like into it. For example, a food with a napkin under it, or a paper plate. Sometimes it let me reheat my tea in a china tea cup, sometimes it sparks. I'm throwing it out! What a waste of money!"
3,This microwave sucks. It is compact but good grief. You can heat a plate of food for two minutes and it's half cold. Both eveness and timeliness are lacking. Pass!!
2,"Microwave is six months old, lightly used by two person household and now won’t heat anything. Noting other buyers failure to get paid shipping from Panasonic for repair, it will undoubtedly be thrown out. Sad."
5,"…and a handle to open the door, rather than pushing a button (who came up with that whack idea?) is a major plus for me.  Of course it does exactly what I expect it to every time. Clean design. Quite pleased."
2,I'm not going to lie. I was excited because we needed a new microwave but times are tough. The wheel that holds the tray never stays in place and the plastic is pulling up on the face of the buttons already and the light bulb on the inside flickers. I can't  afford a new microwave right now and it makes me feel like crap that I spent all this money for something that's already falling apart.
3,"So far so good. Seems sturdy, likely to last for several years. The only reason this got three stars instead of five is due to the fact that it was made in China. Most things made there doesn't last very long."
2,"So this item is small- which is fine, a dinner plate fits inside. The plastic is already wearing off over the buttons and it is only 4 months old.It works fine otherwise. We use it 1-2 times daily."
3,"This is a nice sized microwave oven for a small space.  It is easy to use.  The turntable fits a dinner plate.  On the negative side, as others have mentioned, the oven tends to slide some when you close and open the door.  It gets a lot of condensation on the inside while cooking, so you will need to wipe it out after that occurs.  I have a Trifield EMF meter that I checked this with.  The FDA max safe radiation amount for a microwave oven is 5 mW at 2 inches.  This one is way higher than that.  Therefore I returned it.  Staying farther away from it while it is on will help minimize radiation exposure."
4,"I'd bought this microwave oven after a BIG hassle with Amazon/the Seller over what showed-up in my bank account as a double-billing! FINALLY got it straightened out!And then I can't get the CLOCK to work -- even with the step-by-step guidance from one of their Techs. --Was told to return it for another but I didn't: to get it out of the packing box I had to tear it open -- & in the process broke one of the styrofoam-packing ""sleeves"" safely holding the oven together!The Oven works A-OK however, even the pre-set controls -- except for the clock!"
5,"It eas the perfect size. I don't cook in my microwave,  just reheat or defrost and it is perfect for me. Great value, great looking, easy buttons and I love the handle. It moves a little bit when you open, but doesn't really concern me."
5,This microwave is very well made and it works wonderfully. It is a really good size. It's easy to clean.
4,"I've had this microwave for over six months, and it's been a good one overall, as it is on the small side, which I needed, but not so great in other areas. The touchpad control is very easy to use, and I haven't had the problem with noisy operation that some have had, but the door makes quite a bit of noise when being opened and closed. Along with that, the main drawback that I've noticed is that, unlike other microwave ovens, moisture will accumulate inside when cooking, which is especially noticeable when cooking vegetables that give off steam. I've had other microwaves that ventilate quite well when running, but this one doesn't, and definitely requires leaving the door open for a while after cooking to allow moisture to evaporate. This problem is not unique to this model, so it's not a really bad thing, but is something to consider."
3,"Compact, cooks fine.My biggest issue is that popcorn bags can't turn properly inside. If the bag gets stuck against the metal plate, the paper will burn. I watch the bags to make sure they don't get stuck, which was much easier before the bulb went out (less than two years after purchase).The power adjustment button has never worked, but the return window passed before I noticed."
3,It wasn’t very powerful and it cam with a dent on the side
1,Lasted just a little over a year. Wouldn’t recommend. Would give it a 0 star!!
2,arrived broken.  returned for refund.  not sure how good it works. Bought another one locally.
4,"I didn't pay attention to the size of this model, so its super small compared to what I'm used too.  But as for how it works, it works just fine.  It's not super loud.  You can turn the sounds off if you want.  I've never had issues with any Toshiba brand electronic or appliance so expect this to last for a while."
3,"Microwave is fine the air fryer is really quite good, but I am completely dissatisfied with the baking of the oven. Also would’ve appreciated and instructional booklet especially regarding how to get the best used from the oven."
4,"The media could not be loaded.Love, Love the color. Con: It is loud.  I am guessing the noise is going from a 700watt to 1000watt unit. We don't use a lot so we can deal with it."
2,"Very Loud. It was so loud I couldn't hear someone talking or tv while it was running, which I could do with my previous $100 Panasonic inverter microwave.  I realized I was wondering how long this model would last before I could get a new replacement. For $200 that is unacceptable. I returned it after 2 days use as defective.  Normal noise level for this model? Factory defect? The plastic cling over the control panel was missing, so was this someone's return?"
5,"Used this microwave for several weeks while my kitchen was being remodeled, has an ideal set of features and takes up minimal space.  The 900w power rating means it can be safely used with a 10A circuit breaker."
4,I really like it but the door sounds like it has no rubber seal and it’s really loud.
3,"The microwave works fine, but unless you find a way to label it, it is not accessible for totally blind users. I thought it said keypad, but apparently it is touch screen. Perhaps that needs to be made more clear and I wish more microwaves had buttons like the second microwave I purchased. I tried to stick with Panasonic because they do have some with raise lines or raised buttons that I can feel like this 1.6 ft.³ microwave I bought. Otherwise I like the 2.2 ft.³ but it was not accessible."
4,The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I can't figure out how to get popcorn to pop without either burning it or having half the kernels left at the bottom that didn't pop. Very frustrating. Popcorn is just about the only thing I make in it and that's just about daily.  When my microwave broke a few days ago I was lost lol. But now I'm just frustrated that I can't even make popcorn r
5,I bought this to replace a microwave I had for 15 years! I wondered if I could find one that would be comfortable and efficient as the one I had for so many years.👏👏👏👏 Farberware!! I like everything about this microwave. The 1 2 3 minute buttons and also one for 30 seconds is perfect! The handle to open the door instead of a push button is great as I found the other type of door opener sometimes wears out from the spring action it needs to operate which this one does not need. You'll be happy when you buy this microwave
3,"This is a pretty good convection/microwave oven and my wife and I are learning to use it with the help of a book which we also bought.  The convection oven definitely runs 25 degrees low according to our oven thermometer which I know to be accurate.  The microwave works fine except that there is no ""delay start"" function which I used extensively on our previous microwave.  It's like 2-stage cooking, but there needs to be a zero power setting for the first stage so that the oven isn't running.  This one does not have that."
2,"After half a year of usage the push button for opening is barely working, and it does not heat as well as it did when it was new."
5,"It was like Christmas when I opened this thing....it came packaged really well, well-protected.  There is plenty of space inside for larger dishes.  It has all the features you would expect from a microwave.  In terms of value, it is comparable to similar items.  Overall, HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
1,We tried to microwave a pretzel for 30 seconds and it caught on fire and smoked. Piece of garbage! Total fire hazard
3,This microwave is very sleek looking and has lots of power options for the various cooking you need to do. We are finding that it takes longer to cook items with the same power level as our old microwave. A bit dis appointing. The light inside could be a but brighter and the noise level a bit less.
4,Me encantó el producto son me gustaría que lo embalaran bien llegó un poco maltratada la caja pero todo bien
1,"There is a severe chemical smell that smells like receipt paper. It is still strongly present even after 4 months. (Receipt paper contains BPA). I am concerned that it is affecting my health, especially reproductive health.We kept the unit hoping the smell was just a new smell that goes away after usage but it has not. There are a few other reviews here that mention this issue too.Not sure what to do right now since it feels like such a waste of money to throw the microwave out. So the least I can do is to help warn others about this chemical smell that may not go away. Maybe Farberware will see this review and tell me that I just have a faulty unit.Definitely check out other microwaves and see if other people mention chemical smells that do not go away."
1,I bought this in July and by August it stopped working. I've been too lazy to write a review but now that I got the chance just want to warn you guys.  The microwave lights up and turns on when plugged in but does not heat anything up. I've tried to plug it in all over the house to see if that makes a difference but to no avail.
3,"Got this for my make shift quarantine space just to warm up cans of soup, cups of noodles, pop popcorn and reminisce about freshman dorm life. Plan on cooking things like Cup of Noodles for longer than the directions say. It is super quiet, I will give it that. The only complaint that I have so far is when it comes to popcorn. The built in time is only 1 min 30 secs and that’s fine if you only want really hot unpopped kernels. So that was bag one in the trash. Try two: I figured pop it longer so I went for three minutes and did the “listen for it to pop 2-3 seconds apart”. Bag almost caught on fire and still wasn’t popped more than halfway. The microwave isn’t large enough for a normal Pop Secret microwave bag. Once the bag gets as big as the microwave will allow it stops spinning. It doesn’t allow for the bag to expand enough for the popcorn to get the heat they need to move around and pop. But once it has expanded it will no longer spin causing the bag to scorch. A small single serving bag might work but what’s the fun of you can’t share with your suite mates I mean family. It’s fine just don’t plan on eating popcorn if you purchase this."
1,"This thing gives off a strong ""burning plastic"" odor when running. The longer the cook time, the worse the odor. Has done this since day one. Thought it would dissipate after a while, but it did not. Since I don't use it that often, I have let the return window close. Seems like nothing from China is any good anymore.  Lesson learned."
5,Functions great. Reheating.
1,Hard to get a dinner plate to fit. Complicated to operate.
2,"This was a solid oven for about 17 months until it died violently and abruptly. Last night I put butter in a Pyrex bowl and tried melting it in the microwave. 10 seconds after starting I heard a loud angry buzz as the window filled with flames and orange sparks. I stopped it quickly, so I was able to avoid filling my house with toxic fumes, or a starting a house fire, or both. It seems almost impossible to purchase quality products any more. I would happily pay $300 for a microwave that would last ten years and wouldn’t burst into flames. I gave it two stars only because I personally tend to ignore one star reviews."
5,"I love this item. I purchased it on prime day and meant to put it in my office to heat up my lunch. It heats up food fast, looks sleek even the interior, is spacious on the inside. I really like it and would purchase one for my home."
5,"I like this little critter. Yes, it's a tad slow, and the button functions could be a bit easier. Yes the button text could be brighter... I've got it mounted at thigh level, and my eyes aren't great. But it fits in the space as advertised, is offered at a reasonable price, and does the job. I'd buy it again."
3,"I found that if I press the Time Cook button, I can enter seconds. 12 seconds , whatever. Otherwise there is no 0 button  and it was straight forward to enter the seconds on the pad on my old one."
1,Beware of the interior paint peeling issue with GE Microwaves!  I would advise a Google search on this issue before making a purchase!
3,"We bought this microwave in 2020 and it worked great the first few years, like a good ole microwave should. We are in year 3 now and it has been acting up, not heating evenly or the light will come on randomly after shutting the door, or the light will come on and the microwave will start humming and turning the plate as if it was started after closing the door. Lately it’s been overheating or under heating food or just not working in general."
2,"Microwave is decently powerful. However, it is the loudest microwave I have ever owned. It seems like the door is somewhat loose or something because it just vibrates loudly and is only quelled if I push on it."
5,"No frills microwave, perfect for setting up on top of a dorm sized fridge. One thing to note is that the bottom feet should have non slip pads so the unit does not move when pressing the button the open the door. Sometimes the unit will slide back depending on the surface it is placed on. Recommend a rubber mat of some sort to use below to prevent it from moving. Otherwise it's a well made economically priced product that gets the job done."
2,"Clock Sets itself ahead an hour continuedly.  Toshiba says that is the way it is.  If you want a clock for the kitchen, do no rely on this microwave for that.  The features are very limited compared to the 12 year old microwave it replaced."
5,"This is (almost) the Swiss Army Knife of microwave ovens. This is our second ""all-in-one"" unit, the previous one was called the ""Toastwave"" from Galanz. The Galanz died (twice) faster than any other microwave oven-like-device we've ever had. The first Galanz died after one-day and was replaced without issue.The second one arrived in good working condition but all of the functions except the microwave died in about two years. Pity the Galanz was a beautiful appliance.If you want:1. Microwave2. Convection oven3. Combination (micro+convect)4. Air-fryer5. Capacity over 1.2 cfThis Toshiba is the unit for you. There are PERHAPS some ""better"" units but they always seem to be .9 cf to 1.1 cf. Now if that size works for you, then you might want to consider the Breville (about double the cost) that is a member of the Premium Class of appliances. And it's about $450 or so on Amazon. If the thing had been even 1.3 cf, we would have gone with the Breville. But it was 1.1 which was smaller than the Galanz.At 1.5 cf, you are pretty close to having two ovens if you also have a conventional range. The great thing about these units is that they have the Air-fry function so you can (if you have another stand-alone air-fryer) air-fry corn-on-the-cob in the Toshiba and air-fry your protein in your stand-alone air-fryer.If we had one ""con"" about the Toshiba it's that the microwave is 1,000 watts and an increasing amount of recipes call for or assume you have at least a 1,100 unit. It's a relatively small complaint, we just usually add 10% to the time called for.Love the combi feature, too.Over all I'd give this Toshiba a 4.8 if that rating was a choice. Hence the 5-stars.One last thing: at less than $260, this unit is a value!"
3,"This has proved itself as a microwave and in its other features as well, such as broiler and air fryer.  The controls are mostly easy to understand, but sometimes the manual is needed.  Works great!  The only downside is that the plastic overlay on the buttons wears very fast.  Yet, the reviews warned of this.  I pretend it is wearing like fine leather!  ; )  Definitely recommended!One thing I might change is the three-legged stand.  It falls over way too easy!  Very usable, yet one has to be very careful in placing it down so it does not want to fall over...UPDATE:Cooking elements died after 15 months.I originally went with this product because of high reviews, looking only for a microwave. But, still, disappointed!Have a back toaster oven.It worked okay~ the microwave still works~ but I do not like the shedding/pealing plastic covering of the controls or that it is made in China and that the American company is owned by a Chinese one.  Really, just need a dial.We need to bring jobs back to the United States and raise wages.  Buying from China is shooting oneself in the foot..."
1,Too Noisy!!
3,"I bought this microwave specifically so that it'll run on my inverter, so that I can have a microwave available in my car for my 12 hour shifts at work. That means that I have specific power requirements.The description on the page says that the power usage is 700 watts. Same with the box it ships in. However, the microwave itself says the input is 1050 watts, and I've confirmed that on my power meter.This might not be a big deal for many, but for me, it's the sole reason I bought the microwave. Otherwise, it's the perfect size and feature-set that I need."
2,I’m giving this microwave two stars for one simple reason:  An idiot participated in the design.  EVERY time you go to set a specific cook time you HAVE to go through the clock function.  Stupidest product design I have ever seen in my life!  The only reason we didn’t return it is that my wife convinced me to hang on to it through our remodel and then she’ll donate it charity.
4,"This is tiny in size (the one I ordered), but as a soon to be divorced lady, out on my own, the size is OK for an apartment, but get a bigger size if you can fit it, and space isn’t FREE, as I SO wish that it was. It’s fairly mighty compared to my bigger known brand of microwave. I’m definitely not unhappy with the craftsmanship of this microwave & the price is decent, but I’m not an avid shopper of microwaves, so truly only time will tell! So far, so good!!4 stars for now 👍!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** I hope my review has been helpful 😊! **"
2,Pretty small and takes forever to heat. But worth the cheap price I guess
1,"Wasn’t the microwave as shown in the picture. Called several times to make sure I was receiving the exact item as shown with mirror tint glass front which gives it a stainless steel look. First item was wrong had a black glass front and it came broken and the second microwave came with a black glass front, also. I was totally disappointed with this item I was only purchasing for the look of it as advertised."
2,Demasiado pequeño
2,It died as soon as the warranty ran out.
1,This microwave was amazing for as long as it worked. I brought this February of 2021 and it's already stopped working 4 months in.I contacted Toshiba Customer Support and gave them all the information they asked for (receipt/pic of sku number/etc.) and then correspondence completely stopped. It's been five days without a response or info of what's happening with my issue and at this point I just want my money back. This microwave was WAAAYYY too expensive for it to just stop working within 4 months.I honestly feel cheated and like I wasted my money. I don't recommend you get this. You can defintely get a regular microwave cheaper that will *actually* last a few years.
4,Read all the reviews about microwaves arriving damaged. It came in perfect condition.  Set up was easy. Instructions could be better written.  To early to speak to performance and durability.
2,"The buttons are hard to use, you have to press hard on them to work. The glass plate doesn't stay in place and makes a lot of noise.  This is a mess when cooking and heating up food."
4,"Liked the white color inside.I add time to cooking, because it is only900 watts. Would prefer 1000 watt one &a little bigger."
4,"I was worried it wouldn’t crisp things like a normal air fryer. It works great as an air fryer, but the other reviews weren’t kidding about the beeping. It’s louder than anticipated and since I live in student housing I’m sure half my building hears every time I cook. You really can’t turn the beeping off…. Otherwise works great since I’ve limited counterspace!"
2,Microwave moves all over when I open the door..That I am disappointed .The only thing I don't like irs ..underneath is not solid..when i open the door..microwaves move like dances..dies not have something that can get attached firmly to my table
1,Microwave was lighting on fire randomly after one day. only owned it for 16 months
4,Great little microwave. Love the Alexa feature - very easy to hook up & operate. Only complaint… the clock won’t keep accurate time
5,"Ok, I'll be honest I wanted the Alexa features mostly as a joke to my wife, but they are mildly useful. What I absolutely love about this unit is the beep isnt the typical shrill beeping that most units have, its a very pleasing tone that sounds more like a text tone. This may be a downside to some, but for me it is worth its weight in gold. I'm the type that always stops the unit a few seconds early so i dont have to hear that annoying beep.Its a good size without being silly sized, the display is a very nice and easy to read blue.If you are cooking things in minute increments its very easy to single button start, but if you want an actual granular time like 2:30 then it isnt very intuitive, you can do it, but you will need to read the manual."
3,"I like this microwave ,the problem is the little nobs on the bottom to level it are not level and they don’t seem adjustable.Husband said just stick something under it, well I don’t want to do that.Contacted amazon tech support to see if the nobs could be adjusted, maybe I’m just not doing it right. They tried to contact Faberware and said they couldn’t get ahold of them, never heard back . Very frustrating."
4,The microwave seems to work fine and does everything it should. I did read some reviews that it was loud. I kind of shrugged them off but I have to say it is definitely louder than our last one. We have an open concept living/dining/kitchen area and it is a little annoying. I’m still keeping it but wanted to mention if you are considering purchasing.
4,Working great for both microwave and air fryer. Only issue is the key pad display is less bright and sometimes need another light to see which key you are pressing on.
5,"It's small, but great for my studio apartment"
4,Placed in a office
1,"Pushing to start are setting times is a issue, you really have to push all buttons hard, setting the clock, big issue have to wait till 10.00 pm to set because the zero button doesn’t work. It’s for memory only."
1,Do not buy! Lasted 7 months and quit.
5,"I really was worried buying a microwave online. This one arrived promptly (within three days of ordering)!! Package was nice and secure.. kinda hard to get out of box without help but it was manageable. Easy to set up although I didn’t set up to Alexa. I’ve had this model for two months and loving everything. Fits under cabinet plenty of room, does tend to slide but not when you’d expect ( opening or closing). Stays secure when operating door"
3,The convection and air fry modes are limited and awkward to use.  Noisy and you cannot use kitchen timer while cooking!! I was disappointed in the overall quality.
5,love this product perfect for my space
4,"Love the look. It has a loud hum when cooking, but other than that, I like it."
5,"Replaced a larger model that was getting old. This one has several automated and useful settings for different types of foods. I use the auto settings more for oatmeal and popcorn, but usually enter a time for reheating as the auto-reheat puts food hotter than I prefer. You can enter an auto setting and then a ""less"" button. Overall looks nice and works perfectly."
4,Louder than my old one.
4,Came with a dent on the side and the door kind of sticks but still a great microwave for the shop.
4,"This is a nice little unit for my small kitchen.  I like it very much.  It just doesn't have the power that I was used to, in my larger microwave.  I only use it for reheating and a frozen meal.  I have learned to add 3 minutes to cook frozen meals,  and depending on what I reheat, anywhere from 1.5 to 5 minutes.  I like it hot!"
2,"Beautiful microwave but is WAY to loud, I thought it was broken but i seen some reviews and it's NOT broken lol the microwave is like that...Nope to loud for me Returning it back!"
2,"The LED light that is supposed to come on when you open the door or press the ""start"" button never did. We just took this oven out of the box yesterday, and began using it. Disappointed."
5,I like the appearance and the size of the microwave
1,"this microwave only lasted 2 years. the paint started to chip after 1 year. Now, finally, after cooking a few items back to back (6-9 min) the interior side of the microwave started to swell into a cancerous growth and turned black. I first thought it was food that exploded and stuck to the side but we always use a plate cover when heating food. when I tried to chip it off it just created a mess and didn't budge. The picture is of its final state before we replaced it. The paint chipping is very concerning alone but this is just horrible!"
4,"Such a beautiful microwave!! My roommate and I live retro and eclectic looking pieces and this was the perfect addition to our kitchen. The reason I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the controls are kind of confusing. I’ve ready the directions and I still don’t have the hang of it so I mainly just do the “add 30 seconds” button a bunch of times. If you had a guest over and using this you’d have to train them on it as it isn’t intuitive to use. But the look makes up for that part, so that’s why I didn’t return it!"
1,Disappointed in this microwave. The reviews are so good but its soo loud when it is cooking! I wish I didn't buy it now.
3,We have had this microwave for 3 years and it just quit. I don't have the budget to buy another every 3 years so I will look for another brand.  I enjoyed the combi function.
1,Ups need to pick up I can’t carry it on bus
5,I bought one of these from Best Buy 20 years ago worked wonderful I hope this one from Amazon holds up the same. Large size to accommodate bigger bowls
2,"Simply to use. Ample power to heat quickly. 12½"" i.d., inside hieght clearance 6½"". Smooth surface buttons. Not sure of durability, I preferred my Oster but couldn't find it and settled for this instead. The only downside is the annoying alarm that you cannot silence. Best solution is to press stop before alarm and then again before opening. The alarm will still sound but only two short tones. Won't buy again 👎"
1,"I bought this microwave in the summer and it’s already broken. One day it started smelling of burning plastic, and stopped warming things up entirely. Definitely don’t waste your money on this. I will just be throwing it out at this point."
5,This microwave is so nice. It heats things so quickly and efficiently. I am so happy with my purchase.  I would recommend this microwave to anyone looking for a small efficient one.
4,It’s cute. It is kind of small but it work great.
2,Finally got the part that was broken
4,"Microwaves are one of those things that you have to replace very rarely as they tend to last a long time, sort of like toasters. I had my previous one for over 10 years, and honestly probably could have gotten away with not replacing it as of yet. I wasn’t really looking for a microwave, but what drew me to this GE 3-in-1 Countertop Microwave Oven was the air fry, broil, and convection oven features. I have minimal space in terms of counter space and I was hoping that it could replace my air fryer and microwave to free up some space.Unfortunately that’s not going to work. While this does function very well as a microwave, it is not even an ok air fryer: it just doesn’t seam to get hot enough to crisp food like a true air fryer does. The food comes out slightly better than a microwave, but woefully inadequate to an air fryer. So definitely don’t get this if that’s the main feature your hoping for.But as a microwave this works great! I have absolutely no complaints about the microwave itself. And honestly it’s in the same price range as a lot of other microwaves of this size, so it’s not like it’s a huge deal if the air fry doesn’t work as well. But it’s still a bummer!"
2,I read about this microwave on multiple websites and blogs. The reviews here were good as well so I bought it. I am disappointed. The functions I cought it for do not work well. I was excited about the sensor reheat which overheats everything. And the keep warm function does not work either. The convection function also falls short. I cooked chicken thighs in this and they were dry yet undercooked in the middle. I wish I could send it back but my return period has passed. Not worth the money in my opinion.
3,"I bought this in March 2021. Good microwave at first. Thought I would have  it for many years. After about 2 years, I got an H98 error which means the component that produces the microwaves is fried. It costs more to have it replaced than to buy a new microwave. Bummer."
4,"Replaces a former version of this microwave on our kitchen counter. It is smaller, lighter weight, and both the glass tray and tray ring are reduced in size from the older version. It is designed, I think, to fit inside a kitchen cabinet, which is its best use. Be aware that it is extremely noisy: loud door clink on opening and closing, noticeable noise when cooking, loud ding when finished. It operates at one of the lesser power levels, so takes longer to heat food and drink. However, it's inexpensive, easy to move around and takes up less counter space. Great for reheating individual portions, which is what we use it for."
5,"We bought one of these units on the 26th of June 2020 and it sits level looks great functions awesome.I saw so many bad reviews on amazon so I was unsure if this was a good product. But there was a website that rated this oven number 1 so we decided  to try it. I love all the functions it has and the size is great. We were used to the standard size machine so this is much better. When you put a cup of tea or coffee in the turn table always comes up to the front even after the cooking stops it continues until the cup is at the front, Nice.I saw in one of the reviews that someone said the manual was not very good. Well I went through it and it is Very GOOD. All you have to do is go to the operations section and look at each heading very simple. All functions and directions are there for reference.  This machine does so many things.  WE love it looks great, also has a door you can open and close without pushing those silly door buttons on most microwaves."
1,"I purchased this item in June 2016.  In September 2016, it stopped heating altogether.  The clock still works, the turntable turns, it just doesn't heat items anymore.  Amazon will not allow a return past 30 days.  Basically, this worked for 3 months and died."
1,"I love the appearance of the microwave and how it worked for 10 months.  Then started getting a notice about the door.  I would have to reopen and close for it to work.  That was a couple of months ago.  Then yesterday the turntable worked sporadically and then finally, not at all.  Since I purchased it on Amazon, I went on the website and looked up what I can do to replace or refund this product.  Nobody answers the phone at the number that is listed and website is for cooking and bakeware!  What?  After reading other peoples problems with this product, I DO NOT recommend it at all!  A product should be warranted for at least a year from date of purchase.  Don't buy it, save yourself the troubles."
5,Our microwave died and we bought this one for price as much as anything else. It advertised as compatible with alexa and I could not have cared less. I now love the alexa feature! It's a bit more powerful than our older one and I need to adjust cook times down but it hasn't been a difficult process. I recommend this microwave.
5,Very pleased with this product
5,Perfect for heating up my lunch. I work out of my truck and enjoy being able to have a hot lunch on a cold day! Reheats leftovers or a frozen meal quickly.
5,This microwave is oven is awesome
4,"We needed to get a white microwave to fit the space we had our previous microwave in.  It works very well - especially the turbo defrost.  It is fast.  I’ve used another micro that you only had to hit 1, 2 or 30 sec, and it started automatically.  I kind of miss that.  Overall, it works well and is easy to use.  I’ve only had it a couple months."
2,Had previous one for years; this one lasted less than six months.  Started out smoking from the inside vent (couldn't remember if this was normal with original).  Then the turn table quit working.  I guess they don't make them like they used to.  I'll look for a different manufacturer next time around.
1,"I've had this microwave for 8 months. At first it worked great and I loved it. Now it keeps resetting the clock back to 0, and sometimes when the microwave is in use it will randomly jump cook time which is extremely dangerous!! For example, one time I set it for 3 minutes, about 30 seconds later I literally seen it jump to 35 minutes!!! When a microwave starts doing that it's going up and has to go. It's broken and now I need a new microwave and this was a complete waste of money. Also, if you look at the picture I attached, you'll see the buttons are ripping. I've never had a microwave do that after YEARS of use and this has only been used lightly for 8 months. Those buttons started wearing and ripped after about 3 months. I wish I'd never listened to these reviews now I'm shopping for a new microwave already."
3,"Update #2:Okay, I fixed it. The clock mechanism is what failed, even though the unit would still manually cook. Before calling Farberware, I decided to do what we all do with most electronics. I unplugged it and plugged it back in! Back to working great! However, in my opinion, you shouldn't have to do that! So I've gone from 5 stars to one star to 3 stars, and if it does it again, it'll be back to one star and I'll request a replacement. We don't have power outages, surges, or glitches...no reason for it to lose its mind. Our power here is solid. Still love using it cuz when it's good, it's great! Thought you folks could use the info.I wrote what's below and forgot to submit it! Glad I did! 45 days after receiving it, the clock mechanism died! Too late to return to Amazon, but I'll be contacting the manufacturer for a replacement. If all goes well, I'll edit this again. Still believe this could be a gem.We had a flood, ruined the kitchen. The remodel included the $2400 GE Advantium oven. It's a microwave, a halogen, a convection bake, and will even change your car's oil! Or so they say! The microwave function has conked out on us twice now, though all the other functions remain working. Major inconvenience! After looking around, I settled on this unit to have as a back-up, and we couldn't be happier! Love this thing! Put up an extra shelf in the laundry room for it, and now when the over-priced POS Advantium gives us trouble, we're still good to go! Also, really handy when reheating left-overs, running both ovens at the same time. At 1100wts, it's actually more powerful than the GE, and at 1.1cuft, it's big enough to handle 98% of the things we cook in a m/o. Recommended!!"
4,"Works fine. The wattage isn't the best. But if you have a few extra moments to spare, it's a decent microwave for the money. What I like the most is that is really quiet!"
5,"If Grandma is happy with this unit, we are happy with this unit"
3,"sturdy good microwave. however, buttons are VERY HARD TO PUSH. i sometimes have to hold the microwave and push the buttons. its very hard for my Mom to use."
2,It seems to heat unevenly. The numbers on the display are wearing off. I’m not very happy with it. I’m going to try a more powerful unit next time.
3,"The microwave was inexpensive so the old saying applies. The ""stainless steal"" is really more of a cheap chrome look. It does not resemble stainless steal at all (to match the rest of our appliances). The microwave makes an annoying buzz sound when it's on. The dimensions that were given in the description were to the box it was shipped in, not the microwave itself.The functionality of the microwave is fine, it does heat up food. However, the details of the description were very misleading and flat out wrong. If someone wants a cheap, larger microwave this isn't too bad of a deal - it's just not as described."
1,I love RCA so I ordered this for my son and his roommate.  The problem is it came in Spanish not English.  All the buttons read Spanish!  I'm upset with this issue and unfortunately they ripped the box open and used it yesterday when it arrived.  I wish I could have returned it for another one in English.
4,"This is perfect if you have limited counter space, and do not have enough room for and air fryer and microwave.  It's easy to use and works well.  The only thing I would say is the air frying times take a little longer than a normal air fryer in some foods.  You do have to be careful to not touch the top of the inside of the air fryer while ary frying or after because it's scolding hot, because that is where the air fryer heating element is.Also if you reheat food using the microwave setting, make sure the food is covered because the food will splatter up into the air fryer heating element."
3,"I needed a smaller microwave to fit into a limited space in my kitchen. This one was fairly priced and works as well as any other microwave in my opinion. I like the simple button layout on the front of it and the various options for quick selection for various food items.What I don't like is the smell of burning plastic when I use it. At first I thought I had accidentally left part of the plastic covering on the inside of the microwave or something but I don't think I did as I've looked all over the inside several times just to be sure. I'm hoping the smell will go away after several more uses. But I have to say, I've never had a microwave that smelled like that during operation. Had I known this, I don't think I would have bought it. I don't think it is defective, but they should do something to address the smell."
2,Again..another reason to not buy appliances on line...takes 3 minutes to warm up french toast ..the thing has no power and barely enough space to insert plate
2,"This thing is LOUD. It began to sound like a dying walrus within a month of use. And it is not abused in any way. Only used by adults. Not happy with the ""buttons"" either. Seems as tho there is a small area on each one that is responsive. Well, it does cook the food properly. Sigh."
4,"Wish that the button for timed cook was easier to depress, but all things considered, this microwave performs well and offers good value for the price paid."
1,"I had this microwave for just over a year, and it completely died. It's not intuitive to use - there is no Time Cook function, and it's just an expensive piece of junk. I have an idea for how to fix it, but I won't know until I can find the tools to open it up."
1,Very noisy. Takes a long time to heat even water. I am a big Farerware fan but I do not like this microwave at all.
1,I just opened it 10 minutes ago and the microwave was completely shattered - see photo attached.
2,HARD FOR ME TO SEE NUMBERS .
1,"This toaster oven started on fire, was not well put together. Was a terrible toaster oven would not recommend this to anyone."
1,sounds like a motor boat. even my 100 y/o mother can hear it. also if you want white another reason not to buy. the only white is the glass front. i did not want to order on line in case it had to be returned. i am almost house bound but made a trip to lowes  to buy one but they had no stock for what i wanted & 3 week to deliver so i took chance & ordered on line. now am stuck & unhappy with product. physically not able to carry to ups for return. 1st time sorry i bought something on line. should have read reviews-lesson learned the hard way 2-12-20  HAD THIS 6 MONTHS & IT CAUGHT FIRE. PURCHASED 8-1-19 FIRE 2-11-20 GLAD TO BE RID OF IT & THAT HELP WAS HERE TO
5,"We had GE Convection Microwave.And it was in Buildup cabinets, Grill.We found this unit.. perfect to replace that GE unit.The pictures shows how nice it fits.Other than appearance.. so easy to operate, bright buttons, big big turntable.Overall best unit in this range."
4,"I've had this microwave for about a month, it is noisy but looks nice enough and microwaves stuff.  I wonder if it'll hold up over time- will try to update this in the future if it dies so no news is good news I guess.Update: microwave is now almost 3 years old, and it's still going strong.  For the price it's a great microwave.  Still find it a little noisy, and from all the use the button's plastic cover layer is beginng to show signs of wear/bubbling (like coming disconnected from the hard plastic underneath).  Small complaints when the main functions and hardware are doing great.Pros: it works as expected, sleek appearance, cheap, has lasted 3 years of moderate/heavy use.Cons: loud, covering on the buttons loosens and looks bubbly after a couple years, it bothers me that even after the clock is set properly the colon in the time display blinks"
5,"This microwave was bigger then I expected. It fits a plate perfectly, the buttons are easy to use, and the price is good."
5,"A small, attractive microwave that fits where you want it to and does what it needs to. I found myself adding 50-100% more time compared to a conventional microwave to get my food where I wanted it to be and that doesn't bother me at all - we're still talking less than 5 minutes. Absolutely great for reheating but I can't speak for cooking - I never cook in the microwave."
5,"So far, this unit is living up to all my expectations.  Nice to have a mircowave / airfryer/ convection oven all in one unit.  Comes with everything you will need, very simple to use and also very quiet.  May not be best choice for a small space, but overall, great tool to have in your kitchen."
4,So far we love it. Only negative so far is we can't get it to level which is annoying
2,One bag of popcorn...and the plate inside broke. And it was after I took it out and had sat down to watch the movie!Cheap. As. Hell.
1,"Had the microwave for 4 months, now its completely dead. No lights, no power. Its was nice while it worked. It is under factory warranty, BUT....  I have to pay shipping cost to send it back. Shipping for $35, (new microwave is only $69) and I would have to wait 4-6 weeks (according to the warranty) for a replacement. Very disappointed to say the least."
1,"There is  a horrible chemical smell like plastic burning coming from this when I cook something.  I'm returning it.In reading all the reviews on about 300 microwaves, it has become very apparent that you absolutely want to buy the insurance.  Almost all of them have reviews that say they go out in a year, 2 years, 6 months etc etc etc.  Amazon allows you 30 days.  Spend the extra 30 bucks and get the insurance.  Then it doesn't matter if it goes out."
2,Weird rattling noises starting happening. Also the sound of the buttons themselves are too loud without an option to lower them. Other than that it was ok.
5,"Great microwave, it works fantastic!"
1,This microwave is not working. It didn’t warm food and make a terrible noise. Can someone talk to me
3,"This microwave has performed well for a little over a year. It's small and low power - but waiting an extra minute or two for reheating is fine. Looks great and would have been 5 stars if the interior finish under the turntable didn't start flaking off. Now its rough metal instead of a smooth enamel when cleaning. So far the flaking is limited to under the turntable where it can't get into food. I'll have to throw it out if it shows up over the food. Never had this happen on an appliance before, so maybe they had a bad day in the finishing department."
1,"Panasonic microwave I ordered is H- 9 15/16 ; the W- 15 13/16; D- 14 3/8 inches.  The product I received was:  12 1/4; W- 20 11/16; D- 14 3/8The microwave I received was larger and would not fit into the space in my kitchen:  If you have the smaller size I would gladly ask for an exchange, but I am afraid that it is too complex to deal with at such a challenging time for us all.  Feel free to contact me if you find a microwave that can fit the space in my kitchen.  I would gladly pay.  Rona Kiley"
3,"I was so excited about this product. I never could get it to work with my phone and when programming manually, it the most you can put in easily is 6 minutes otherwise if more minutes you have to add them 30 seconds at a time. I can’t figure out how to put anything on less than 30 seconds either. After a year and a half my light is flickering like a strobe effect."
3,"This is the second Toshiba Convection Microwave I have owned.  They are Inexpensive! First one lost chunks of it's # display some time ago and now the turntable is grinding, jerking after a little over 3 years. Recommend the 5 year Repair/Replacement Policy for cheap. Biggest issue is the room has to be VERY BRIGHT to see anything on the control panel. I am forced to use a flashlight to be able to manage anything. One image is what you see without a light on the panel and the other is using a flashlight to illuminate the panel. My opinion, HOW STUPID!"
3,"Microwave works great, but crappy app needed to integrate with Alexa is what knocks a couple stars off.  App is some chinese smart appliance app, not a first party Toshiba product.  App requires an internet-based account to be created.  Only one person can be logged i to the app at once, so no way to let both adults in the house remotely control the microwave with the app.  Getting Alexa to talk to the app took several tries but we eventually got that working.Worst problem though is that if you have the microwave connected to the app, you no longer control the clock, and the app thinks all of us are in EST timezone.  If you set the clock manually, it resets to internet time within a few minutes.  This is a known bug in the app but no fix available.I will update this if any of these issues get fixed."
4,"Like most all 700 watt microwaves, they seem to rust out inside the box after about 5 years but still remain functional. Kind of wish I could keep it longer to see how long the magnetron would last but it got to the point where I could not keep it clean."
3,I purchased this one because of the air fry feature so I was really disappointed when I used it to make frozen french fries. 30 minutes the microwave was so hot and the fries were cooked and hot but  not crunchy. The conventional oven and microwave are very good so I'm not a total loss
4,"So far so good.I did use the on/off function for the very loud alert when it has finished it's cooking time.I really like the memory turntable return. It brings whatever you put in there back to where it started.The key pad is too touchy, sometimes it puts something other than what I put in the key pad."
5,"Ease of use, ease of opening/closing. Only dislike is light stays on if you forget to close door tightly and you can't see clearly inside while running. Love the red trim color and everything else about it😊"
1,Well it arrived so I'm giving it one star for that. The glass turn table was broken and I thought I could live w/o that or replace it. The reason I purchased a microwave was really just to pop popcorn w/o burning it like my old antique microwave does. If you use the popcorn button on this microwave MAYBE half the bag gets popped and so I tried just giving it plenty of time and listening for the popping to stop and I got popcorn that's burnt. I don't know what the issue is. Not powerful enough? I didn't imagine that I could be so disappointed with a newer microwave compared to my antique but I don't feel any better off. I really didn't have a lot of requirements so I did not spend a lot and bought one that had been opened and returned. I can understand why. Did I just receive a lemon?
5,"This was the second of these microwaves we had. The first one died of old age, and this one worked great up until yesterday (3 years).In the middle of the night while we were sleeping, the glass on the door shattered. We have no idea if this started as a small crack that we couldn't see, was spontaneous, or was the result of something external (a randomly floating object or angry ghost? Doesn't seem likely, but we were asleep, so there's no telling).Because the microwave worked perfectly until then and we can't be sure about the cause of the shattering, I'm leaving it at 5 stars for now, but I still wanted to add this to the review in case this is a recurring problem."
3,"It's been a good microwave, and is great for small spaces, but it is rusting and paint is peeling as shown in the picture.  It's been about 18 months. With the door closed, it doesn't show, but it is only going to get worse.  We tossed our last microwave because it had a lot of rust and peeling paint and this one seems likely to meet the same fate."
2,"We can't stand this microwave!! The glass plate does not stay on the wheel whatsoever! It doesn't matter what type of dish we use, the plate always slides off the wheel. I've elevated the feet at different levels, lowered them, propped up one side, propped up one side while lowering either the front or back. I have done everything short of gluing the stupid thing in there, and yet it continues to go haywire. The door sounds completely hollow so it makes such ruckus opening and closing which makes it almost impossible to hide out from the dogs whenever we're trying to snack on the down low.Oh, and the door handle is flimsy, and the 0 (zero) is in a dumb place. We're buying a new microwave and it certainly won't be a Toshiba."
2,"Having lived with this microwave for some time now, I have come to the conclusion that's it's not particularly good and is a purchase that I regret.* The alexa integration is buggy at best* The clock does not account for daylight savings* The microwave fails to heat food anywhere near as thoroughly as my last one"
2,"So....We received this microwave on May 25th and it is now July 1st and Amazon is sending a replacement.  Why?  I don't know where to start.  This microwave looked good, of course the light never worked so we guessed on when to stop items at first.  Then, we were able to tolerate the noise it made during the first ten seconds of operation, which sounded like a pan vibrating on a washer during the spin cycle.  But....the noise it started making on June 30th was not tolerable.  Imagine metal grating on metal.  I looked on the back to get the info for when I contacted Farberware and noticed it was manufactured in May, 2017.  Two years old??  I got online and saw my last date to return to Amazon was June 24th.  Okaaaay.  I called the number provided online which was not the number.  I called the correct number and was redirected to a free emergency medical alert necklace after answering that , yes, I'm over 50.  So I hung that call up, and re-dialed.  Of course now that number was 'not available' to my service area.  So I got in touch with ""Christian"" from Amazon, (very nice and helpful.)  Christian had a direct number to Farberware who told him that model was too old and they won't service it.  Christian is now sending me a new two year old microwave and I get to send this one back.  The moral of the story??  I don't have a clue!  Just don't buy this one!"
2,Every time when it’s done it makes 5 times very long and loud beeeeep! Sometimes my kids are sleeping it is really loud and can’t stop! Omg it feels horrible! I got so nervous every time trying to stop it before the timer is done! But it does have one good thing is you can do just click one number to start it for any minutes. But if there’s an option to make it silent that would be perfect!
3,Legs on bottom aren’t adjustable and microwave rocks. Very unfortunate because it is just too big and bulky for me to return.
2,"Nice size, kind of noisy operation, dead turntable, returned for refund, would not buy again."
3,"Got this microwave in 2020 as it was a wire cutter pick. It’s small bad worked fine the first 2 years. Then it started malfunctioning, food was heating up too fast and smoking. It’s fine ifYou are ok replacing in two years.  Replaced with a GE model."
5,"Bigger and heavier (sturdier) than I expected but that’s a good thing. Great space on the inside for air frying purposes (comes with racks and trays to do those with). Keep in mind it is not a huge microwave like I make it seem. It’s a good size microwave, bigger than your average $20 microwave I would say but not overly huge- perfect size actually, sturdy and quality is great. Can’t wait to try it out!"
3,"The product itself is great. However there was a massive dent in the microwave when i opened the box. Considering this was $100, I’m not happy about this."
4,Gd deal
2,"Bought and received by June 30 2018, and it does not heat, down not stop, and smells to burned cables.  Last night  I was heating up our dinner and it suddenly stopped working. It’s being used for domestic purpose  only."
4,We have had this product for over a month in a small commercial office setting. It has performed well and heats quickly so cook times are typically less than stated on boxes. We'll see how long it holds up!
2,This is my second Panasonic inverter microwave.  I have bought them because they are lighter to ship and move.  Both units have stopped working after a couple years of use.  (I'm not hard on appliances.) No one wants to repair them.  I hate the waste and the landfill space of cheaply made electronics... I'm going to try going without a microwave for a couple of months and see if the family with tolerate it.  I'm so tired of shoddy appliances being made today.
2,Works HOWEVER Good thing it was bought as spare. I forgot to READ reviews! Should have passed on purchase. Buyer beware.... Package came damaged and it wasn't packed for shipping IMO. Not expecting it to last now
1,"I purchased this microwave back in September and it's already unusable. It throws sparks when turned on to heat something causing a very dangerous condition. Was using it about once a day to every other day before this started happening. Not even 5 months of use before it goes out, bad investment.  My old microwave prior to getting this one lasted at least 5 years. The farberware microwave website has no contact info for support."
4,-+Great for small space.
3,"Loud. Also, stop button is orange, not the start button. So that took time to get used to. I think the start button should be visually different.After 6 months, the plastic over the buttons started to bubble. Looks terrible."
4,The plate I side does not turn though they give you a wheeled ring to use. Makes getting things into the microwave tricky as the plate shifts if you are adding your plates or dishes.
3,"Meh. I guess it's about as good as the price you pay. It's really weak, and takes longer than most microwaves to cook anything. But, it works, and it's small, and fits just about anywhere, so if that's what you need, I'd recommend it."
4,"I had this microwave in my last apartment, so naturally I thought I’d get one for my new apartment. For some reason it always feels like the buttons are in the wrong places. Other than that it’s good. Doesn’t take up too much space on the counter"
4,"Wasnt expecting much so this turned out great, has all the basic functioning as in my previous oven so this worked as a good replacement"
1,"Purchased on October 21, 2017.  But it died dead as door nail on 2/15/18.  WHAT !!!  Thats right, and call for a refund or return to factory for repair and forget it, passed from one phone operator to another."
5,Just the right size for our daughter's dorm room.
5,"I am really loving this microwave. The turbo defrost works great for me. Yes, it does slightly heat up portions of the food that you're defrosting, but not a big deal if you remember to keep turning it.The buttons can be a little squirrely but I'm not a type A so it's fine.My only issue was that the stainless steel surface showed every touch and fingerprint around the door and push button. I solved that problem by buying a sheet of clear plastic adhesive. You can't even tell it's there and it works great.The biggest issue for me will be if it works long term. For me that will be at least 10 years. I know that is a lot to ask nowadays, but my last microwave lasted almost 30 years. If it goes TU before then, I will update my review."
5,Its different than all other microwaves that I've used before. I still dont understand the multistage cooking feature. All together very good microwave.
5,"Its not a dial, you control the timer, nice looking, cant beat the price for quality microwave"
5,This microwave has had superior heating (over the monstrosity that we previously had...it finally died.)I had not researched microwaves but it fit our needs and was on sale. It's black and stainless coloring is a nice update to our kitchen.
1,I have only used this a couple months and the plastic covering over the numbers and buttons is bubbling up. Unfortunately beyond return window.
4,"When I bought this, I was definitely downsizing as my initial microwave was an over-the-range model.  We have since decided that over-the-range models do not stand up so well with a lot of stove top cooking and they get so greasy!  This model works out well for countertop use, but it is a little bit louder than expected.  I think it is the turntable that makes the most noise... even if it just a small popcorn packet on it.  However, as we literally only use it for heating things up and making popcorn, I am totally ok with this purchase."
1,"I bought this for my Airbnb in 2020. It is difficult to understand the buttons and settings. It is much different from American microwaves. Then, when my guests were trying to figure out how it worked, they accidentally started it without anything in it. Because that happens regularly due to the difference of what we’re used to with the controls. IT CAUGHT ON FIRE! The inside was flaming. Don’t buy this! It is not safe. You may think, “maybe there was metal in it.” There was not."
3,"Got this microwave in early June 2017.  I was pleased with it and really liked it until last week.  I was wiping splatter on the inside with a cellulose sponge and a 1 1/2"" piece of something fell onto the turntable.  When I looked at the ceiling of the microwave, I saw that a piece had peeled off and there was a large area that was bubbled up and ready to peel (see picture). We use it routinely, but had had it for less than 4 years.  I expect a microwave to last longer than that."
3,"We bought this machine because it will fit on a deep windowsill in our kitchen given its relatively small exterior size.  However, it is noisier than any microwave we've owned.  There's a loud droning sound when first heating an item.  This decreases somewhat during the heating process.  Even more strange, the rotating platform makes loud clicking noises as it revolves; the sound resembles a train traveling down a train track.  It seems to heat well enough, which I suppose is the whole point, but do be aware of the noise this machine makes.  If you have reflective acoustics in your kitchen, as we do, this may be problematic for you."
5,"This microwave has only been used for 2 months, but it is performing just like you would expect it to"
2,Dosen’t have a warm selection nor can you have the option of turning your turn table off which sucks because large plates and even microwave covers are too big for this. Should have gone with a size bigger.
1,Product is not heating well at all .I need to heat 2 it 3 times.nit satisfied at all .
1,"Microwave died after only 7 months. I have only had two microwaves in the past 26 years with the last one dying after 10 years of solid use. This one conked out after 7 months when I left it on without anything inside for a few minutes. Trust me, I have had microwaves for years and pretty sure I have made that mistake in the past but this one died after one small mishap. Always bought Kenmore brand so I purchased one of them. Hopefully it’s just the Toshiba brand and not all microwaves being made cheaply."
2,"Product heats good, but is very loud when running"
2,"After 2 years this is now landfill material, which really makes me mad because I'm all about reducing my carbon footprint, and I live in Hawaii, where trash ends up in our ocean. The light inside started flickering about 6 months into ownership. 2 years in and half the buttons don't work. The warranty says ship in the item and in 6-8 weeks they'll process your warranty claim and ship you back repaired or new. However, I'm seeing posts that suggest Farberware won't even cover it because they're not the manufacturer, they just put their name on an ""Edge"" product, whatever that is. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
1,This is such a disappointment. Trash being sold on Amazon.
4,"Ordered this for its relatively small size as I live alone in a small apartment in NYC. Size is great and despite the low square footage and wattage, holds a decent sized plate and heats food quickly. My only complaint is that due to its small size and weight, when you push the door release button, the whole unit moves under the pressure of the opening. A little bit of a hassle, but nothing I can't manage. Thought about putting a non-slip rubber beneath it to help -- just not sure about whether that's a fire hazard. Overall, good!"
4,No issues with this microwave for the last 2+ months. Works perfectly fine.The silver color is ONLY on the front side.....you dont get this detail in the item description. Not that it matters but be aware that the top and sides are black if you plan to use it as a countertop or tabletop microwave.
2,"It's small, which I need, but I was hoping for one that was more consistent when heating.  What might take 2 minutes to heat one time will take two-and-a-half or even three the next, or, I might get and overheated or burned dish, when all other factors are the same:  item, amount, heating dish, etc.I really cannot recommend this item."
4,Interior is small ... good for a quick reheating
5,This microwave works wonderful to me your food is nice and hot
3,"It smal, it's cheap, but you'll have microwave your food longer to get it the same temperature as a normal sized one.  Also, it defrosts poorly.  Other than that it good.We bought it as a substitute while the stove over head one gets repaired... could out as a pare or give you the kids when they finally leave the nest"
4,It worked great for about a week. Then it would not let us program the clock or let us use it as the digital panel seemed frozen. Lights worked but it would not do anything. I unplugged it for about 5 minutes and it started working again as it should. It is easy to use and clean and does great heating up food. I give it 4 stars due to the malfunction.
4,Its good to use but a little smaller than I thought.
5,It is functional.  Just for warming I never cook in microwaves.
5,Our old microwave had to go. We had repaired it several times over the last 20 years. This one was the closest match to size and brand to the original GE. It is mounted in a cabinet above our built in oven. The old faceplate fit pretty close to the old microwave. Handy husband made a couple of adjustments to make it fit a little better. It is working great. Had it for a few months now with no issues.
4,So far a good microwave. Some positive and negative.+=Cooks very fast. A bag of microwave popcorn that took my old MW (rated 1200W) two minutes 45 seconds to get done only takes one minute 35 seconds to done in this one._=You cannot cook something while the Timer is in use. You could on our old one.Time will tell on its durability. Our old one (a Kenmore) lasted 12 yrs.
1,I bought February 27th 2023 and it stop working today July 19th 2023
5,Bakes really well and love the air fryer setting I can highly recommend it
2,The noise
4,Light is not bright enough
1,"I purchased this item from Amazon to replace a smaller one we had for almost a decade because it was falling apart (but still functioning). I passed on the extended warranty from Amazon, because who thinks a microwave will stop working after 14 months? I contacted Amazon to see what they could do for me since the item is obviously outside of their 30 days return policy. As expected, they were unable to assist, no blame to them whatsoever. I contacted the manufacturer (Toshiba/Midea Support) and spoke to a nice enough representative who gathered all the info I could provide. She instructed me to submit proof of purchase and I did. She told me that she would extend the warranty for another 90 days as a courtesy to make the item eligible for a refund. She called me two days later to inform me that my refund has been accepted and would take two days to be approved. During that time, I received an email from another representative informing me that they were sorry and they could not assist me further. This is a day after the first representative contacted me to inform me that my refund was awaiting approval. One day later, the first representative contacted me again to inform me that my refund was denied because the information I sent them to show proof of purchase indicated that I was paying the item in a 6 months period and they weren’t sure if I paid the item off. I was flabbergasted at the level of stupidity and the horrendous service I was experiencing. I can go on forever as this was not the end of the terror, but I will stop here and say Toshiba will never make a penny from me or anyone I know ever again."
3,"For me the unit had major problem, it kills the wifi connection to Roku, so no TV or Ipad when ever I use the microwave. The old microwave  did not have a problem with cooking and using the Roku or  Ipad.Otherwise the unit works as intended.Update: Thought I fixed problem by using channel 6 on router, but all it did was delay interrupting the wifi signal. Seems like 30 seconds or less and wifi signal not lost, run for minute or more and wifi is disrupted."
4,"The turntable is 10 inches diameter, like all 700 watt microwaves. Not 10.6 inches as advertised."
2,Too Loud
5,"So far, so good.  The machine worked out of the box as expected.  One touch controls to heat for 1min, 2, ... 6 minutes.  My last microwave was a built-in unit, so this feels a bit tinny in comparison, but nothing that seems to affect function.  When running, it does make for what I would call a loud hum, but not worse than I was anticipating -- just not what I would call quiet.  The feet are a bit slippery on a tile/stone surface.Biggest issue with this model is that it does not have the microcrisp feature, so I still need my air fryer."
1,"We ordered a replacement.  But, the  unit we initially received was damaged.  And, it wasn't damaged in the shipping. (No signs what so ever of package mishandling by the carrier).  The unit had been either factory packed that way... or the unit had been previously returned.. and then repacked with existing damage.  See the Photos.  The Toshiba store is inaccessible for feedback... at least in my attempts.  Interesting that they are not accessible.  Just be wary when you unpack the unit so that you are able to return it if necessary."
1,"Initially, I was a little disappointed with the build quality - touch pad is cheap and buttons are hard to press; button to open door flops around a little; loud fan, etc. - lower design and build quality than I've seen in any Panasonic product (and I've had several), but it worked well enough for a compact unit. Now only 3 months in, the controls have gone completely haywire and it's unusable and unsafe (can't turn it off without unplugging!). Closest service center is 100+ miles away and shipping is expensive, so I'm just going to cut my losses and replace it with another brand. Surprised and disappointed."
5,We have an air bnb and wanted a small unit for the counter.  This is powerful and perfect.  Nice unit.
5,"I received the Microwave Oven/Convection Oven a couple of days ago and so far I have just used the microwave oven and must say I am very please.  My Sharp Carousel II that I had for almost 36 years went on me the morning I had ordered this oven.  I was very fearful about ordering a new one because my old one was so perfect in every respect and I was so use to it.  I did not think another microwave could takes it's place.  This Toshiba is about the same size inside, but about 3"" larger in width.  My old one had a automatic minute button and that's what I was worried about whether this one had it.  Fortunately it's even better you can push the 1 to 6 buttons automatically to get 1 to 6 minutes without pushing start.  This is a feature I use the most.  The stainless steal inside is beautiful and shiny, I'm not use to that.  I have a toater oven that is a convection oven also and I use that more then I use my conventional oven, so I cannot wait to try the convection oven.  The convection oven appears to be as simple to use as my current one.  It is a large oven so you definitely need the proper space to set it on.  I did order a silver one but was sent a black and silver, but that is ok because it matches my toaster/convection oven.  After placing the order I thought that I should have ordered the black and silver to match my toaster oven, so someone was reading my mind I guess.  All I can say so far is that I am very happy with it's ease of use, it strong construction and again that beautiful inside.  Also it comes with two stands for convection cooking a short one and a taller one which is very good.  I will be able to get a larger cooking pan in this oven for convection cooking which is great.  Now whether it will last 36 years as my old one, I doubt it only because they don't make appliances to last like in the old days.  I do recommend this product at this time.  If something changes, I will add to my review."
5,We had been wanting to upgrade our microwave for sometime but could not find what we wanted. We finally found this one and absolutely love it.
1,Not what I expected very disappointed
1,"I purchased this microwave a week ago. It was working fine until the last night it started by itself. I unplugged and replugged the cable several times, but did not solve the problem. There was no water or moisture around it. Once I plug in the cable it just starts by itself; none of the buttons work! You can imagine what could happen if it started after I slept. This is so dangerous and I strongly recommend NOT to buy this model."
2,"As others have reported the weird glass tray rotation ""skips"" and ""clunks"" from time to time...what a bad flaw in an otherwise perfect microwave."
2,One year and two weeks after purchase this microwave repeatedly went POP POP POP with sparks shooting inside. Smell of something burning. Always kept it clean and maintained. Very disappointing. It really is a beautiful microwave and worked great until this.
4,"A great Microwave for the price however, the lack of a 1 and 2 min button that forces you to enter in 1:00 and 2:00 is a little annoying but all in all I'm really satisfied."
1,"The media could not be loaded.Ten months old and already shot. Shooting flames when you try to heat anything and no, tin foil wasn’t involved. Up your homeowners if you purchase!"
5,We had to order a microwave in a hurry because our other one stopped working.  We researched the best microwaves and this model was in the top five. Very easy to use. Touch the start button once to heat for 30 seconds. Or hit a number on the number pad and the food will heat for that number of minutes.
5,"love having a second microwave and the oven is great for baking small amounts for 2 persons-cakes, breads bars and meatloaf"
4,"Bought this because the measurements in both the image and listing say 11.48""D x 19.15""W x 15.91""H. They have the height and depth reversed.It's actually 11.48"" high and 15.91"" deep. This leaves you with a lot less counterspace in front of the microwave.Also, there was a worrisome buzzing when I plugged it in. I called customer support and they said it wasn't supposed to make that sound, so I have a defective unit. There's a few other reviews that mention the same so definitely don't keep your unit if you hear that. Or keep it what do I know. Have a nice day!"
3,"The convection oven works well, the microwave works well. There is a combination function combining microwave and convection cooking.  There are instructions on how to turn this function on but I have been been unable to find anywhere how to use this function. What's the point of having it if you don't know what it can be used for, why it should be used and how to use it."
4,Great microwave.  Only thing I didn't like is very dark inside.
2,"I have had this microwave for 2+ years, it has been wonderful.  Have used it daily with no issues whatsoever.  Until the bulb started to flicker on and off during use.  Checked You Tube for bulb replacement advice, and it’s a little on the advanced beginner side, but straightforward enough.  GOOD LUCK finding the bulb! I called the customer care number, and they can’t find it. I’ve looked on amazon and eBay, NO luck.  My hardware store tried.  Just a cautionary tale:  make sure you can replace the light bulb before you buy!  LED shouldn’t burn out in 2 years."
4,"!! Remove shipping film from oven cabinet BEFORE YOU PLUG IN,it covers the cooling vents should be #1 in the manual! ! #2 Cool down feature leaves some items HOT! #3Setting the mute function incorrect in the instructions.Press/hold kitchen timer clock mute button till beep,press again 0000 appears,press ECO button once, now muted repeat this for sound on.The good news is this  ,nice finish,properly placed quality feel controls you'll know the first time you touch them.Oven light bright and on door open&cook.Door handle comfortable,precook menu spelled out clearly below pleasent blue LED display you have to see to appreciate.Measurement at front cabinet opening 10 13/16 Lx6 7/8 H larger inside. Best that I've found features/price, after some returns other brands keeping this one.9/22 Still working after alot of daily use&some oops/abuse!But there is room for improvement,#1needs longer fan run time after cooking ,best if controlled by humidistat,simpler program inputs,improve turntable drivelug fit.Tip:Use covered container for liquids Pros: Return to position turn table, Able to fit larger covered casserole dish & no overheat issues on outer cabinet,low energy consumption & mute/display shut off,Still a  Value!"
2,"Have owned this for a month and I use it a few times a week. It still functions but is nowhere near as powerful as it was a month ago. For example, frozen Costco burrito microwaved the same exact way every time, now I need to microwave the same burritos twice as long for them to cook fully. Other items also don’t cook the same anymore"
5,After frustration to find good microwave a friend said I should get one with an inverter. This one is great! Just a touch bigger than my old one but slim enough and has a bigger inside.
5,"This is a great little microwave. Big enough to fit 4 large potatoes, or 2 bowls, or 1 large dinner plate. Heats items well.CONS: Can't do more than 1 thing at a time. Example:cook or timer, not both. Beeps 5 times when function is done. Does not beep again to remind you."
1,"I have no picture because it’s gone. It’s been replaced by a Panasonic..  the first time I used it after four minutes of heating it decided to stop and cool itself off then you can’t use it till it decides to stop running the fan I took the food out close the door the fan just kept running I had to unplug it or leave the door open then I had to hit it on the top to stop the fan. I couldn’t use it to heat anything up for more than a minute before the fan went on and it wasn’t heating. I threw it away. I’m super upset. I wrote the company and got no response my Panasonic Genius Sensor 1200W Inverter is awesome . Nowadays there’s no customer service. I sent an email to February. They said somebody would get back to me. Every time I went to chat there was nobody available, so yeah it has a warranty if anyone contacts you.NOPE spend the extra money and get a good one"
1,Cheap looking.  Door doesn't close appropriately.  No return contact from seller.
2,"This is the loudest microwave I have ever heard. I hate using it because the noise actually hurts my head. It does look nice and works well, but I can't give it more stars due to the obnoxiously loud buzzing."
4,"Love the visual appeal - inside & out - & big interior (1.6 cu ft), & all the features.  But...  doesn't seem to let me use a bake function alone - without the convection function."
2,They say the smell would go away. Not true its gotten worse smells like something is on fire inside. Also was quite now makes so much darn noise when in use. Will be returning.
1,"This microwave is already dying on us one year later. We have to keep adding one, now two minutes to everything. At this rate it will be dead in a few months."
5,"Ill tell you what...I don't recall the last piece of genius design we had for a microwave, but, this one by TOSHIBA is awesome...30 secs. for a cup of coffee...instead of like 5 mins...man oh man...All I can say is that...this one is quiet, powerful, awesome!"
1,"This microwave worked great for exactly one week, then it quit working and we have tried everything and there is no fix.  I didn't buy an extended plan so I am out of luck and a microwave!"
2,The only thing tahat works is the microwave part called about it was told to send it back who keeps the packing stuff for weeks or make a video of it not working and the loud noise it makes. Great support HA HA
1,Very slow.  Much slower than my 20 year old microwave that died.  1.5 min barley heats a cup of coffee.  And five very loud beeps.  Returned.
5,"We have had this for 2 weeks. We got the stainless steel/black version and we think it looks fab. Ours is very quiet. This microwave has an array of cooking options from heat levels to times which all combine to give you really precise heat. I have discovered that to reheat a nice bowl of pasta or tofu, rice and veggies is ten minutes at heat level five which is fifty percent heat. When it runs at 5 for heat, or fifty percent, the motor will cycle on and off so as not to run at 100 percent heat. My food is a nice, edible warm-hot but not blazing, bubbling or piping hot! But, you could easily combine the setting to set your food on fire in short time! Large cooking area is easy to reach into, it also has a decent light. For the price, and if it continues to run, we love it! If it dies, I’ll update this review. So far, so good and I highly recommend this microwave!"
5,So far grilled cheese 🧀 and French fries 🍟 does a great 👍 job
1,I had this microwave for just under a year. It has a 1 year limited warranty. 2 days before warranty expired I was defrosting a cookie for 30 seconds and I smelled something burning. I opened the microwave door and gray smoke billowed out. It was not the cookie it was something electrical. I called the service phone number from the product manual... no longer in service. I emailed the service help addresses. Just got a failure to deliver message. So I’m stuck. I guess I can be glad I was right there in the kitchen and didn’t burn my house down.
4,"Like ease of operating.  A bit smaller than I expected, need to take extra care to make sure items don't touch sides when cooking.  Overall, very satisfied."
4,It’s very tiny inside but it does the job
5,"Our last Panasonic kicked the bucket after 11 years.  After doing a lot a searching, I Settled on another Panasonic. Just about one smaller all away around. But my main casserole dish fits in it. So that was important. It is lighter in weight, so when you close the door, it tends to slide a bit on counter top. Still looking for small rubber feel to put under corners in hopes to stop that.Cooking time is right on. Happy with the price.  Everything has gone up so much.  Very happy with it. If it lasts as long as my old one, I'll be even happier."
1,"Looks matter, and all things presumably equal, we bought this for its handsome appearance. However, if failed in its second year: Began sparking. This is a waste of resources. A lot went into making it, and it should last longer. I should have read reviews: Normally I go straight to the worst reviews, this time I didn't read any. I still think it looks good, but durability is also important."
2,Microwave works but covering inside peels off and rust so not the best
4,"Okay granted I do use this appliance every day so it has been used 70 times, but I don't understand why that would cause the glass rotating plate to crack into 4 huge pieces.  The oven is working fine but now I need a replacement glass plate so I will be out of commission until I find a replacement.  It is really big appliance and takes up a lot of room on the counter."
2,The door button is very poor quality. Push it 3 to 4 times to get it to open. Have to push the door hard to get it to close. Don’t buy this model!
3,Doesn’t have a 30 second button or quick cook which is very convenient. I was a little disappointed about that.
1,Too small
2,"We purchased this microwave in April 2021. We had an older model of the same that still worked but after 8 yrs decided to upgrade. A few weeks ago it stopped working and displayed the error code H98, which we learned means ""primary failure in the magnetron or inverter circuitry"". This must be repaired at a Panasonic repair place. BUT try to get Panasonic to respond to ANY inquiries or reply to an open case. My issue was the two authorized repair places in my area were closed. So they had to ""escalate"" my case. You can't get through by phone, your only option is via chat. 4 weeks later, 3 chats later, still no response from the escalation team. I just keep getting told I will hear back in 48 business hours. IT'S BEEN WEEKS!!! And our microwave is still inoperational. VERY disappointed this microwave didn't even last a year but more disappointing and frustrating is the complete lack of Panasonic customer service. ZERO customer service!! I finally contacted Amazon and even though the return window has closed, they refunded 90% of the cost I paid for the microwave and we purchased a new one. A Toshiba microwave and so far workds great! We will never purchase anything from Panasonic AGAIN!"
5,"This this is a great small size, works perfectly and is almost silent."
4,"Es bueno, pero siento que se me va dañar en cualquier momento"
3,"Ok, so 2 months into using the product, the door has started not wanting to stay shut.  We literally have to slam the door to get it to latch shut.  Something doesn't seem right to me.  It's ridiculous how hard I have to slam this thing to get it to stay shut!"
4,It is huge….Works great
2,You need to have 12 inches above the unit so you don't potentially burn your home down! It says this in the directions but nowhere on the website!?
5,"Funny, I checked out Black and Decker 1000 watts that was unable to pass the simple water test. This Toshiba costs less, much quieter, and at only 900 watts is excellent heating.I highly recommend"
3,On the whole satisfied but extremely difficult to set clock.  Would chose another product.
1,"Not only is this machine incredibly noisy compared to my old one (which was over ten years old) but it also is rickety and shakes while cooking. I have everything installed correctly, that’s just the way it is. BUT the WORST PART: it doesn’t cook well at all! If a package says cook time is 5 minutes this easily takes ten. It’s on 100 percent cook level. I’ve looked online and people agree these are well known problems."
3,"We were happy enough with our microwave for a while. I don't like the dark interior. But a couple of times it just made really loud noise as it was cooking. It would do it for a few days, then quit making the noise, but kept working. Now, exactly 14 months after we got it  (it has a limited 1 yr. manufacturer's warranty) it just quit cooking. The light comes on, but it won't work. I think it should have lasted longer than this.Farberware FMWO13AHTBKE Professional FMO13AHTBKE 1.3 Cubic Foot 1000-Watt Microwave Oven, Stainless SteelUPDATE - IT STARTED WORKING AGAIN! We had to have done something wrong ourselves, because the next day I just tried it and it worked fine. Maybe someone forgot to clear the cook time or something simple like that. And it hasn't made any more weird noises either. So I am upgrading it to a 4 star. I hope nobody passed up buying it because of my review! It had to be our error! So sorry Farberware!3/25/2020 less than 3 years after purchase. Microwave just stopped working again. No idea why.  Several days ago the turntable started continuing to revolve after opening the door. But the oven was clearly not still cooking, so we continued to use it. Today it just stopped heating entirely. Light and clock are still working. Timer works. But no heat. Google says a microwave should last 10-12 years for normal household use. I'll try a different brand this time."
1,It should be 0 stars option. Don’t purchase this microwave it Doesn’t work I got it for heating food something so basic right? It doesn’t heat food or cook.
5,"This is a great microwave, plus it acts as an oven too. Perfect size for our counter. Very pleased."
5,This microwave is one of the nicest ones I've owned. I really like the button settings and the crisp feature. I love the size and that it still fits perfectly on my counter. The noise level is a little louder than what I would like but I can deal with that.
1,GE can't be bothered to add instructions in the package. The pdf instructions you may eventually find in Amazon are really useless. (see table page 17...brad: broiler NR; Yeast?...means...??) .  There are multiple features in this microwavel but you have to figure it out by yourself.  I even called GE customer service but they were clueless. GEEE thanks a lot.
5,Small for my counter space and love the color
2,This microwave is average and loud while running. I really do hate that its loud.
5,"small, efficient, easy to use"
4,good
3,"I've had this microwave for two years and the light has started flickering.  The booklet that comes with it doesn't even mention the bulb, and what I find online ranges from open it up (but don't see how) to throw it out becuz it is poorly engineered to not allow the bulb to be replaced.It's frustrating becuz it is not very old, and the microwaves I've had before (including one that was also a convection) lasted for many, many years.  The oven works fine, but the flickering light is bothersome."
1,Did not work from the beginning and we let the return period pass.
4,"It is a good microwave, was disappointed when I saw the interior not white like the pictures showed but other wise it works good."
5,"Loved the look, easy to use only issue was no “popcorn “ button, it says one button popcorn but this model doesn’t have an individual button option on the interface. A little loud when closing, otherwise very quiet, nice light. Nice big buttons and clock. Matches my refrigerator and looks very modern."
1,"I received this shortly after March 25th. It seem to do the job. Easy to operatate. It is extremely light weight, though, so you have to put a rubber mat underneath it in order to not have it slide all over when you open the door. Takes 2 hands to open this: One on the handle and one above the clock area so it doesn't fly off the counter when you open the door. Apparently, the warranty/return time frame is about 30 days. So, on April 24th, the microwave started filling with all the moisture. Not venting correctly at all even though I have it pulled out by itself so it has air to vent all the way around. The return window for this piece of junk was April 23rd. Talk about perfect timing with this microwave. If you read the other reveries, I'm not the only one complaining that this microwave turns into a pool in your kitchen. It's getting tossed/recycled as I know it's going to short out or catch on fire."
3,Works okMight find a little stronger microwave for the money
1,Horrible !  Made noise from day one !  Good co and too late to return .  Disappointed
5,We thought the microwave was broken it was so quiet.  It’s perfect and especially for the price. Even better
5,"I was very pleased when, I received this microwave. It's compact just the way that I wanted. It doesn't have a clock on it. Just the way I wanted. And it does the job fast and it is easy!  I am over the moon with it.🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂"
1,The microwave does not work on the first try. Makes a very loud humming noise that only stops when you push down on the top. I tried to heat up my dinner and it took 12 minutes to warm up one chicken breast.
3,When I unpacked the microwave the door looked higher than the frame and there were 4 small dents on the door at the top.  I tried out the microwave. It successfully heated water but I could not see inside as the light was so dim. Our last microwaves always had a bright light so you could see what you are cooking. It is impossible to see with this one. The microwave lookes nice but the handle is very flimsy. The metal part on the handle bends as you hold it. Overall it was a mistake to buy this. Faberware is usually a good brand.  I am returning it.
1,it's not stainless
1,Works pretty good! But the odor that came when it shipped I thought it would be gone by now. Smells like insecticide was used in it ....3 months later...smell gone?Nope....I am starting to wonder if my food is going is being affected by it.At this point I'm thinking of selling it cause I can't return it.
5,My old microwave died and I bought this to replace it. It is a nice size and sits on my countertop under the upper cabinets.  Functions are very good and easy to use. Very powerful and does a good job with everything I have used it for. Highly recommend.
4,good deal for what you get
2,Worked fine until it burnt-out after 18 months
2,"The convection feature on my unit does not work.  It emits a terrible noise, and gets so hot, you cannot even touch the countertop.  Customer service is very poor.  The first agent said that, yes, it will get warm.  Warm doesn't even describe the problem.  Every correspondence I've gotten says they will take care of it in 1-2 business days.  I've been working with them for over a month, and just run around.  I sent all the information they asked for.  After a couple of additional e-mails, I was told that it was sent in the wrong format (I followed their request).  Now my option is to just use the microwave function, or trash the whole thing!!!"
4,It’s ok
5,This was the cats pajamas. Fit opening like a glove. 1200 watts too!
1,"Microwave oven arrived missing a plastic foot on bottom. I tried to use the Panasonic ""chat"" option and was on ignore for over an hour. Then could not find phone number or Panasonic. The Panasonic phone listed on the Amazon order was for an independent retail parts only house. Beyond frustrating!However, I called Amazon customer service and they were extremely helpful in resolving my issue.Just be very wary of buying any Panasonic products. I certainly will never buy another one!"
5,It was exactly what I ordered and needed.  Heats food perfectly
3,"The microwave itself works fine. The problem is it's integration with the Alexa app. We have been using the microwave only 6 weeks, and it has already lost connection with Alexa at least 4 times. Once I was unable to reconnect the device and it randomly reconnected on its own days later."
1,"I ignored the bad reviews and purchased this microwave because it was the right size I needed for my counter space. It was great for about a year, then it started losing power. And after another year, it completely malfunctioned and started turning on BY ITSELF.  Holy FIRE HAZARD!!! Thank goodness I was home when the issue began or I’m afraid to say what could have happened. Buy at your own risk."
4,"Microwave function works great. Outside of oven gets very, very hot when use convection oven. Directions for air fry function are confusing and seem to be basically same as convection cooking."
1,THE ABSOLETE WORST!!!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS!  It goes on fire and smokes the first use.  Seriously  DO NOT BUY THIS OVEN!!!!!
1,This thing is small which wouldn’t matter if it worked well but you have to microwave thing 10x to get it to heat up
2,"The Amazon integration has stopped working after a couple of months. I cannot change the clock setting and have it ""stick"". After a few hours it reverts to the original. Poor user design. To start cooking you have to click time button twice. The first one is for clock and the second for cook time. Given that you routinely set a cook time but rarely change the clock time they should reverse the click order. It seems to cook as well as any other microwave and has enough power but the wi-fi integration is flaky at best. Update after a year's use. I still can find no way to adjust the time permanently so live with the clock being an hour off six months of the year. Definitely would not recommend."
4,Does a overall great job heating anything you put in there. Doesn’t have a lot of bells or whistles on the display. Instruction book doesn’t really explain the settings for defrost time or weight times. But you can figure it out
5,"I was worried the smaller oven would be flimsy and cheap, but I absolutely love this microwave! The design is cute and retro and fits nicely in my small apartment kitchen, and the smaller oven has rarely affected the cook time!"
2,"Lightweight Use Recommended.  There is a hotspot: where most of the rays are concentrated in one zone thereby causing uneven heating. You could have one area of your food heated properly and the rest unheated.  This may be suitable for reheating but not for cooking. If I buy something to perform that is what I want it to do. When a mug of coffee takes 90 seconds to get hot, then I know this is not for me. I read the reviews before purchasing and thought it would work for us, but it is just marginal."
3,HAD TO REPLACE BROKEN TURNTABLE RING
1,"I used the microwave, set on 2 minutes, on the morning of April 10, 2022 to heat water.  Microwave beeped off and I retrieved my cup.  About 1 pm I kept hearing a beep coming from my kitchen.  Well, I don’t find anything except the microwave is sooo hot.  I moved it away from the plug and tried to unplug it.  The plug was burnt into the outlet.  I finally got it out…the microwave obviously malfunctioned and never turned off after having used it.  Thank God I was home and prevented a fire 🔥.  Maintenance had to retire the outlet …it was burnt out."
5,"Bought in June 2017, still works great 6 yrs later! I really wanted a small countertop microwave that was stainless and white. So many are black and would've stood out in my light colored kitchen. This one has been great, no issues or malfunctions, the door opens and closes, turntable spins, etc. The only inconvenience is that the light bulb went out and I haven't bothered to replace it yet. As mentioned in other reviews, the interior is rather dim so it is hard to see your food even if the lightbulb works. (Part of that might be because the screen is white, so your eyes don't adjust to ""see through it"" to the inside as easily as a black screen.) We just got used to stopping the time and opening the door to check on stuff.***Also, highly recommend the white magnetic shelf seen on the side of my pic. Comes in a 2-pack and easily holds boxes of tea or glass spice jars without falling or slipping.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DDBV6ZW/"
5,An excellent microwave! Reasonably price and well-designed! Highly recommended!
3,Disappointed that the plastic on the buttons didnt stay on product well.  Also light inside microwave makes a buzzing sound when door is opened
4,"There's a lot to like about this microwave. It's quiet. It's easy to clean. 2 things that annoy me a lot are that you need a 12 inch clearance above the unit to use the non-microwave features. You don't find out about until you read the instructions. That would require remodeling my kitchen, so useless to me. You can't get the dark buttons on a black background to light up which means you need to turn the room lights on in order to use this or keep a flashlight next to it at all times. That is more irritating than anything. I wouldn't buy this or recommend it without pointing those things out first."
1,"I didn’t really like having to press “time cook” before the amount of time you wanted to hear things, but I could deal with it. The problem is that it stopped heating things after about a month. It turns on and runs but heats nothing at all. Now it’s a hassle to return."
3,"I like it, it worked fine, but then it closed and a piece of it popped off at top, am I now getting microwave energy?"
1,I hate this microwave so much. The Quick 30 button is far from quick as you still have to press the Start Button. What’s the point of it? There are zero options for a 1 click start. Also I have yet to figure out what the More and Less are supposed to do as they don’t add or subtract time and are thus pointless. Also the light inside is very dim so you have to press your face against the door to see inside. Every time I use this microwave I get angry at how annoying it is to use... the only plus is it’s pretty quiet after the first 5 seconds
4,This is perfect for small spaces. If you have ceramic or slick surfaces in kitchen you will need rubber stick on for the bottom of the microwave to stop it from sliding around. The microwave felt flimsy at first because it is so light weight be after affixing the rubber feet to the bottom it is perfect for the use.
3,"Worked ok, but big, and quite loud operation."
1,When we received the first unit we were unable to set the clock. We called customer support and they did their best but the clock feature would not set. They suggested returning the unit and we did exchange that unit for the same unit we originally purchased. This second new unit has the same problem. You cannot set the clock time. We have to decide weather to return this unit as well or except this defect in being able to see the time of day on the display. Or purchase a  different  microwave all together.
4,This microwave was bought as a gift. I’m sure the recipient is going to love it.
4,I have had this for a bit and so far so good.  My only complaint so far is that is quite loud.
5,Looks sleek and expensive.
5,"Our microwave died and the 6 of us were quite distressed! As a very busy, multigenerational family who only could eat meals together 2-3 times a week, it was quite obvious we needed a quick replacement. I did a lot of research and as all of us no, you’re going to read lots of negative reviews amongst the good ones.  But I’m happy to report, at least after the first month of LOTS of use, we all love it!!! And it’s HUGE inside!!!!!!"
5,"When the microwave that came with the house became defective I had to look for one that would fitin the frame.  I found a Panasonic that is the same model as the one I just ordered from Amazon a couple of weeks ago.  My brother had to modify the frame a little and the microwave fit just right.  I bought a second microwave and stored it in my garage in case the  one I replaced had a problem.  I may not be able to find another microwave to fit so I was planning ahead.  Years later I finally had to use the second microwave.  This was  less then a year ago.  Somehow the second one became defective after a few months.I had to slam the door and then sometimes it would work.  Pressing the button to open the door was another problem.  It would open slightly and I had to pry it open each time.  Now I needed to buy yet a third one to fit the frame.  Fortunately and to my surprise my son found the same model on Amazon.  I ordered it and it still fits the frame.  The door opens without a problem, and it works!!!!!  I couldn't believe that after all these years Pansonic would still make the same model.  I was so happy.  I got so used to prying the door open and having to press the buttons to try and get the thing to work.Capacity is huge,  the turntable that comes with the microwave is very big.  You can use it as a serving platter if you needed to.  The buttons are easy to press.  I use the power level at 5 to melt chocolate chips.  The defrost feature is helpful so you don't cook the food.  There is a keep warm button that I've never tried.  Usually I heat the food and start eating so I never have to keep warm.  Reason why you heat up the food is because you want to eat right away right?!  It's like WOW this works so well!!!  If you need a larger microwave oven I highly recommend this model.Thank you Amazon for selling this item, I am forever grateful.  I'm thinking of ordering another one in case this one becomes defective."
4,Value heating pre-cooked meals
5,"I like the style and look of this microwave, it is easy to use, clean and good as I expected… The price was great too."
2,Bought this microwave in August 2021. It’s been zapping occasionally for a few months but tonight it caught on fire while I was making a bag of popcorn. Now I get to buy a new microwave.
2,"In November 2020 when I bought this, my review was Great and 5 start and my comment was, ""Better than I could imagine it working for my kitchen.  It's small, convenient and easy to use.""Now, less than 6 months later, my review has changed to reflect my experience.  I'm giving 2 stars because at least it lasted almost 1/2 a year prior to no longer working.Update 3/6/21-It's a dud.  A crude, loud sound started and the light started flickering inside prior to it no longer working.  I bought this microwave back in November 2020 and less than 6 months later, I'm disappointed because I now have a microwave that doesn't work.  I thought I did a good job researching prior to buying this one, but lesson learned.  I'm back on the market for a new microwave and I'll opt to get one with a familiar name brands I trust to deliver a good quality product that will last a while."
5,Purchased for my daughters small apartment. Footprint is perfect for tiny counter space.
1,I bought this product in November 2018. It’s already shot - suddenly the microwave won’t actually turn off unless it’s unplugged! As soon as you plug it back in it turns in again and just keeps heating - none of the buttons work to cancel it or stop it from cooking. Unfortunately my return window on the product has closed now too.
4,This thing has cooked like a dream.  Looks great seems well made so far.  It’s pretty quiet.I was going to return it because the panel is impossible to see.  I have to use a flashlight in the daytime to see what I’m pressing.  Some of the items that flash for instructions or notification on the panel are so tiny they are hard to read even with reading GlassesOn.I kept it because I couldn’t find another black stainless steel one that was comparable in size.This Toshiba  is roomy.  I think it’s 1.4 or 1.6 cannot remember will try to update.
4,"I prefer countertop microwaves to over range microwaves, but my last one took up too much space. This one takes up maybe 2/3 or 1/2 the size, but still fits a dinner plate and heats just fine.For sizing purposes, i dinner plate fits, but leaves about 1/4” all around once it’s in so use a plate to determine if it will be big enough for you (and you know, the measurements).Only two things I was disappointed with:1) they put a sticker that said to remove film before use. Fine. Upon removing the sticker however, it it tore some of the permanent film on the number pad, pretty mad about that. See picture.2) the feet/bumps are metal and I’m concerned they’ll scratch my countertop. I put some felt on them but feel this is a detail the manufacturer should think of and solve for. Other brands have."
3,"I got it because it was within my budget, however because of that what I got was of course going to be pretty small (which it is). You could easily have it on a kitchen counter and have space. So considering that it's great for reheating a snack or a cup of tea BUT due to the low wattage, if you want to heat up something frozen or something with a little more volume, you will need to add a minute or two for thorough cooking. I love that it has a kitchen timer and that the beeping sounds aren't obnoxiously loud. I haven't cleaned it yet but it doesn't seem like there will be too much trouble there."
1,"UPDATE: I have dropped my rating to one star, and vow to never, ever buy another microwave from Panasonic. After six weeks, I finally have it repaired. Panasonic's customer service is terrible, and gave me one heck of a run around. No customer should have to go through what I did to get mine fixed. Had I known of the hassle beforehand, I would have just thrown the microwave in the dump. I was told at least 3 times that the case would be ""escalated"" before anything ever happened. Then I was told that once received, it would be repaired in 24-48 hours. It was closer to two weeks. When I opened the box today, I found dirty finger prints and some sort of adhesive on the microwave. They could have had the common courtesy to wipe it down and make it look presentable. I am done with Panasonic. I was forced to use a competitor's brand while mine was in for service. That has been one heck of a microwave, and you can bet I will be looking at that company for my next purchase. The used loaner has already outlasted the Panasonic, and I bet they have better customer service. I see lots of 5 stars by other reviewers. Maybe I got a lemon, but maybe theirs just hasn't broke yet. When it does break, good luck. My advice is do not buy this microwave!!!!!I owned this microwave for six weeks and it no longer works. I have a H97 error. Since it is still under warranty, I contacted Panasonic who instructed that we take it to the nearest Service Repair Center. Drove an hour to get there, only to find out that it can't be fixed. Was told to call Panasonic back and tell them to ship me a new microwave. I did just that and was told my case will be escalated. 72 hours later, I called back to find out nothing has been done. Really? Was told that a Field Rep has to make the decision on whether or not replace the microwave and case will be given to him for review. CS suggested that I call the Service Repair Center and ask the repairman to call the Panasonic Field Rep. I should not have to do that, and won't. Panasonic needs to get their act together fast before I finish this review. It sits at 3 stars right now, and I will change it to either 1 star or 4 stars depending on Panasonics response time and decision. I am the customer, and I am the one without a microwave at the moment. Let's see how Panasonic treats its customers."
3,"Arrived on time, seems to work okay, but when it arrived, the casing on the side was loose. Hubby jammed it back in so it seems to be closed, and it works. Takes longer than expected to heat things. I just hope it isn't leaking microwaves all over the kitchen when we use it."
1,"LOL, this thing does not work. It will turn on for like 5 seconds and then shuts off. None of the buttons do what they say or they do something different every time. It is totally unusable."
4,"Loudest microwave I've owned, but cooks very well and I love the color. You get used to the sound but it's an adjustment at first."
1,"Looked good, right size but would not heat up right out of the box - returned."
3,Works but you most definitely will have to ungrade because it doesn’t heat food well. 8 mins for 3 pieces of bacon ?!
3,"I had given this product 5 start and I'm changing it to 3 start because the large button you press to open the door is not longer working consistently. The rest of the review is as I'd written on the SAME DAY the open-door button started to not work! We'll see how the seller responds. I needed a microwave big enough to warm large dishes especially for holiday family dinners. I got this before Thanksgiving when my old, old microwave bit the dust. It served its purpose well for the holiday and it has served me well every day since. It takes some getting used to because my old microwave was so slow. I had to adjust cook times downward. I like the plus-30-second function, how easy it is to see inside, and how simple it is to keep clean. Using it the first time was intuitive - no messy instruction reading! I'll probably never use the bells and whistles that are available and require reading, but I have used it to defrost and that worked well."
1,"The advertised internal dimensions are totally misleading.  Do not think you will be able to fit a dish that is nearly as large as the advertised dimensions.Advertised Internal Dims:__Wide: 12.05""__Tall:  8.11""__Deep:  11.97""Measured:__Opening Width: 10.75""__Opening Height:  6.75""__Practical Radius: 5.125"" (from center of turn table to nearest obstruction)__Practical Diameter:  10.25""  (2x radius)__Plate Diameter:  11.3""  (My plate.  It fit in my old 0.7 cu-ft GE microwave.  Does not fit in this ""11.97 inch deep microwave"". )Plus, notice the protrusion on the inside right wall.  How is a person supposed to fit their larger taller dishes in there?  Unless you only eat microwaved popcorn in bags, no one has dishes that are shaped like this inside volume.  Besides the misleading advertisement, the design just seems really poor with the pop-outs off axis and too high to use with a plate.**I never ran mine, so I cannot speak the performance of the unit.  When my favorite plates didn't fit I put the MW back in the box and returned it.  I wasted four days on this poorly presented mistake."
2,Works great however the damn thing is dead already didn't have it a year yet and no longer works
4,"Nice 700 watt microwave, it is still working."
2,"Does not heat as it should, takes multiple times in the microwave to warm up food. Unfortunately didn't realize this until after the return period ended"
2,"We have only a small space so there were not too many options from which to choose. The functions on this one seem fine but there is a major design flaw, namely that the glass turntable has a very tenuous support on the rotating base underneath it. The slightest sideways bump knocks it out of place and there is no definitive way to reposition it, just kind of slides around until you get lucky. I don't understand how the product engineers let this pass. I have owned several microwaves and for all my previous models the glass slips into place and stays positioned correctly without much fuss."
4,Smaller than anticipated and takes longer to warm food
1,"Although the overall appearance of this product is fine and the controls are laid out in an easy to use display, the operation leaves a lot to be desired.This appliance fails miserably in its operation. The unit loses power(not from the electrical plug) after it runs for several minutes. I suspect an issue which is causing the unit to get too hot and subsequently cuts internal power. It remains out of use until it rests for several minutes, then restores power back to the control panel.I would not recommend anyone purchase this model as I am concerned about the issue causing a fire."
1,Does not heat or work
5,I really like the stainless steel inside and that the buttons light up. Everything is working perfectly.
5,"Aside from taking almost a week to deliver and the box it was in looked like it was in a demolition derby... This product is very nice!Again, the container box was all but destroyed and held together with packing tape. Even the internal stryofoam packing material was broken up into pieces. I inspected the microwave and found...ONE SMALL DENT IN THE FRONT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE MICROWAVE DOOR!I am devastated. A thing of beauty marred by carelessness and forever delivery nightmare.I will use this microwave and hope nothing happens later down the road due to the obvious mishandling of my paid for product.Oh the humanity! One small dent that can be seen from across the room on such a large appliance."
3,"First of all, the first one I ordered arrived DOA - no lights, no beeps, no power. Fine, Amazon will replace it of course. A hassle but not a huge deal.More importantly, a serious QoL issue that had I known wasn't featured, I certainly wouldn't have ordered it: you can't run the kitchen timer and cook something simultaneously. I know, it's either important to you or not. It's important to me. The manual even states that you cannot use the cook function while using the timer function. Apparently that level of technology hasn't been achieved over at Toshiba. Thankfully my Walmart no-frills microwave is capable. Otherwise, yep...it's a 900w microwave."
3,The door opening and closing is a loud clunk. While operating it hums very loud because it vibrates its wall panels. If you press your hand on the side or top it gets a little bit quieter. Why isn't the technology these days sophisticated enough to produce a simple quiet microwave??Other wise it's good looking and functions well. I'd say the size is medium.
2,Good size and functions but buttons are very difficult to use. Wouldn’t but again.
5,Had this brand for 23 years until turntable motor broke down. Now this new one is expected to last that long or longer
1,This is my second order for the same brand and model. Nothing wrong operationally with the one I bought back in 2018. Just a minor RUST behind the bottom part of the door. Descriptions showed country of origin was USA but back label showed Made in China…very disappointed!!! I’ll probably sent this back…
1,"I used it 3-5 times to microwave and it worked great. The next time nothing! I don’t use it often at all obviously, so I missed the return deadline. Stinks! On fixed income and out $200. And I can’t afford to si ply buy a new one. Saved a long time for this one."
2,"Noisy product, not what I expected from BD.  Turntable now making noise after 3.5 mos of operation.  Buying the extended warranty plan may have been wise."
1,Was not expecting this to stop working after only 3 years. Very disappointed
5,"Perfect for my ""tiny apartment"". Very attractive/Sleek. Cooks great!!! Perfect selections....I Love it!!"
1,"Purchased in 8/2019.  Was pretty satisfied with it, until it suddenly wouldn't start one day.  The lights would come on for a few seconds, but with no heating, and then lights turn back off.  Took it to a Panasonic repair shop in town, he said it was the Inverter board and would be cheaper to buy a new microwave that it would be to fix it.  So I then found the inverter board on ebay.  The new part was installed but didn't fix the problem."
2,This item was below all expectations. The door was loose. It was noisy as it went around. Very cheaply made. Not a good value. Returning.
3,The power cable is so small. Toshiba could have installed a descent size wire instead of a tiny one. Buy an extension if you don’t have power source within half meter.
2,"Smaller than expected,even though I checked the measurements. Lightweight, so the whole thing moves when opening and closing the door, larger plates and such don't fit. Keeping it for now, then passing it on to one of the kids for their dorm."
2,"It heats things fine, but gets weirdly wet on the inside, have to wipe it out constantly."
5,Great product.  Previous negative reviews don't make any sense.  Not a thing wrong with this Toshiba.  Great for small spaces and great bang for your buck!
2,Did not buy from Amazon but had same model lasted 6 months only
5,Easy to operate and size is more than adequate.
3,"It was too big, so I returned it."
2,I bought this microwave in October 2021 and it's July 2022. It doesn't warm up my food as it did in the beginning. Now I warm up food for 5 minutes and it still comes out warm and some parts cold.
3,Happy with our purchase. Small but does the trick — except:Update: steam/moisture is trapped inside the door. Is is dissipating slowly over an hour+. I steamed some rice and I guess there was too much moisture. After wiping it down I have left the door ajar. See photos.
2,"I purchase for the Brand since have had many items that just seem to do well for me.This is a disappointment functionally for two reasons -1) IT SLIDES all over the counter. Why would ANY OEM build something that will live on a formica counter top with SLICK, unstable supports? I just don't get it.2) Tiny thin, writing on Black, not back lighted - Labeling. Until this product I never needed to turn the big light on in the Kitchen AND put on my glasses. Now I do.The noise put me off a bit when first started up - startled me.All of my other Microwaves, ever, had a fan noise and more of a higher pitch, light hum to it. This one is to me, 3x's as loud, with a low, very textured buzz (not a hum a buzz, buzzing - heavy running sound).It's not the least expensive, not the most costly and since I find price is not always, or even usually an indicator of ""good/not-good"" - I went with brand and reviews.I did read the, or see the reviews that state the same as I say now - NOW I understand - but just didn't ""get it"" until today - wow - what to do.Otherwise, the controls are somewhat intuitive.The times to heat are about the same or the same as on my 1200 watt unit or the prior 900 watt unit. I felt that there was no need to use that much wattage to heat water, or warm food, etc.I was anticipating the inside dimensions being ""tight"", but remain functional for what I experience with other units. So, what I mean, as e.g., is like - I'd love to heat 3 slices of Pizza same time one place as with the room or power with the 1200 watt unit. However, I often wind up doing two or even one slice in order to over all just heat the slice versus getting very ""spotty"" hot/cold not evenly warmed. Slight overlaps of slices never works and actually have burned things when got jammed/not rotate. So, the smaller footprint would seems as a non-issue, or better this way. HOWEVER, as the Manual says, allow for THREE INCHES all around this unit when using, placing it. So, it may not ""functionally"" be a small a footprint as you imagine if don't have that for air/heat which you need to take *seriously!So, anyway, it's a microwave. The door looks safe, will remain safe I hope, not sag, loosen up, etc., ""leak"" as is the warning concerning the - Door. However again, the Non-back lit Control Labels, small font/type and thin/light/hard to see AND that now I have to figure a way to keep it from SLIDING ALL OVER my counter top - SO DANGEROUS even for ""Adults"" - WOW. I looked in the box for some anti-slide thing not installed - none. I mean - where - is a Microwave EVER INSTALLED that is on a NON-SMOOTH, easy to clean, sanitize surface - ""sliddy""? Where - Black+Decker?In my opinion, that miss the mark for what I would otherwise, as first use rate would rate otherwise, 4 or even 5 stars. Then the Buzzing when running thing - is likely something that could be addressed. As with many things I see today now usually has to do with lowering the cost of manufacturing. I deal with mechanical audio and ""hear"" what they've done versus could do to quiet it down substantially.So, I hope that assists someone. Additionally, all in can say if Sliding is an issue, Small Control Labels, and Noise is an issue - take those Reviews to heart to consider - those are issues and wish I did. Yes, I could return it and may - we'll see. Who's to say what the others may be like - so... how much time to spend on this. Returns, especially with something this size are not easy for me to ""get to a shipper"" - so, consider all that is my advice and experience."
3,"I just received this unit today and the model # matched.  The internal dimensions were 8 7/8"" x 23 5/8"" x 13 3/4"" and not 9 15/16 x 155 13/16 x 14 3/8 as stated on the Amazon website.  I did not plug in the unit as it is too small for our intended use."
3,"WIthin several months of use I noticed that the microwave was intermittently cooking at 80% power when using the preset express cook functions. And then it would work perfectly for several days before malfunctioning again. So I contacted Farberware and they will send a new microwave only after I cut the cord to my current one, thereby leaving me with no working microwave for probably 7 - 10 days.  I then asked for a refund which was refused.Similar to many electronic devices, unplugging and resetting the microwave seems to work, but only  temporarily. But overall I am displeased by both the quality of the device and the warranty terms/restrictions.UPDATE - I proceeded with the warranty replacement - sent the photo of the disabled microwave - reply the next day that it was out of stock and possibly available in 3-4 weeks.  Farberware did Not offer to send another model, but did offer a refund , BUT, not for the full amount that I paid!! (minus sales tax)When it worked properly, I was satisfied with the unit.  But it had a definite problem in maintaining the correct power level (which thankfully was evident within 2 months of use).  The customer service/warranty coverage is lacking , company centric, and overall poor.UPDATE # 2  I received the replacement microwave and  4 weeks later it also started to randomly cook at 80 % power level.  This is a known defect for over 2 years and yet the manufacturer keeps selling them without fixing the problem. There is no financial incentive as long as we keep buying their defective, cheap, disposable microwaves."
4,High noise level and button is very stiff
4,Very nice compact microwave. Roomy inside with glass turntable. Fits nicely on a countertop.
4,"I gave it a 3 star because the keypad to me is a little hard to read. Also there is no included handbook with the unit. Although, I have basically been able to figure it out. I have not really used the convection setting yet, but the microwave works fine, and I have really gotten into the air fryer part of it which works great"
5,LOVE THIS LITTLE PORTABLE OVEN/AIR FRYER!!!MY KITCHEN DOESNT GET 1000 DEGREES IN THE SUMMER WHEN I PUT IT ON!!!WORKS GREAT!!!! GOOD PRICE!
5,Have not had a lot of experience using this microwave yet. But so far it loves up to its write up. It take some time to get familiar with the cooking settings. I enjoy the Sensor Cook setting. The instructions should offer more of the basic cooking settings and timing.
3,"I was not sure when I ordered this, I needed a smaller microwave but the power on this one does not seem to be up to par with what my old one was. I am considering returning it and getting a different one."
3,Marginal item buttons numbers coming off works ok but next time I spend more money on a better one.
3,"I just hope the last few months of use haven't poisoned me..I'm to old to care much or I would have returned it..Would  be a 5 star if it hadn't taken months for the chemical smell to dissapate, after 3rd day I dusted inside with baking soda and boiled water to steam  it up wiped it out clean.. did not help.I was concerned when I saw the door window fogging up in between it's double window construction.. took about 10 minutes tp clear. so no more than 2 minutes at a time when dish is steamimg.anyway.. The smell is finally gone now in the 4th month. It looks great.. has more buttons than I'll ever use.. I only set time and lower cook % . the extra cook function are not intuitive and never worked for me. and I don't see how alexis is of any use.. just another something to go wrong. I put the food in and turn it on cause I am standing there putting the food in.. DUH untill alexis can take food from fridge and put it in the microwave for you.. Alexis is just bloatware"
3,"The box that the microwave was delivered in was damaged, and my packages were delivered to my front door even though I  Specifically specified for them to be delivered to my back door. Luckily my microwave was not damaged."
2,The product works but more pieces of it were broken than described.
3,To much trouble to send bk so I will use it w/o the 7 button
1,This is not the microwave in the pictures. The buttons are different. It does not have a popcorn setting. The clock will not set. Yes I read the manual that it came with and the one listed on here and those instructions don’t work. I returned it once for a replacement but the second one is exactly the same.  You can see from the questions several people are having this problem lately.Poor quality control.
3,"It is a great microwave for a small apartment, but I live in a small house and I want to kill it with knives."
2,"After two years, the microwave stopped working, displaying an error code: H98.The inverter is shot.Piece of junk.BEWARE"
1,I absolutely loved this microwave for the first year- it was great other than the clock.. no matter how many times I set it.. it would always automatically set itself 1 hour back within a day or so. But I easily looked past that because the microwave worked great and looked great! Now just a little over 1 year of owning this- it is not working properly at all… like it is not heating anything up or when it does- it takes so much longer to heat things up and it makes all kinds of crackling/popping sounds. I am out of luck because the warranty is only good for 1 year and we literally just passed the 1 year mark of owning this. I would stay far away from this microwave and choose one from a more reputable brand… unless you like purchasing expensive microwaves every year. I definitely regret this purchase and wish I would have kept my older/uglier microwave that this replaced.
2,"It works ok but the darned thing slides all over the counter when my wife or I open the door.  My last unit had a door that opened when a lever was pushed, so the microwave wasn't dancing all over the place when the door opened.  I should have studied the picture on AMAZON more closely.What really annoyed me  is that making popcorn demands that you know the weight of the popcorn you are popping - sorry, I don't have a scale in my kitchen.  Thot that was pretty clunky design; my old machine had a button for popcorn and that was all it took.  I doubt that when I replace this I will get another Farberware."
2,"Seems to be a good microwave.  A little noisier than the ones we have had in the past. It was louder, and then when it started to rattle inside it got a LOT LOT LOUDER.  It vibrated and got hot. Couldn’t stand it. I have to return it. Pointless hassle."
3,It replace an 8-year-old microwave of the same model which was wearing out. The functions have changed but I am unsure if this is an improvement. The open door lever at the bottom right is loose and rattles.
3,Smallish and light weight but door stopped working after two months.
3,Size is exactly what I was looking for since I wanted to tuck it away. I don’t use a microwave often but wanted to have one on hand to reheat my coffee etc. Some things take longer to coon than the recommendation time.
4,Like like the size and color of the microwave.
4,"So all in all it’s a fine microwave, cooks relatively evenly, the start button that does an automatic 30 seconds is handy (though sometimes I wish it was just 10sec) but the only big complaint I have is the button to open it is very tight/resistant so EVERY time we push the button, it scoots that side of the microwave back.  If we had it on a counter against the wall, giving some resistance, it may not be a problem, however we have it in an open cabinet with air gap behind so it just gets pushed lopsided into the cabinet all the time, pretty annoying"
1,I would not recommend buying this microwave. It does not evenly heat food and it takes quite a while to heat. Spend an extra 30-40 and get a higher powered higher quality microwave and not this one! I regret my purchase.
4,"If your main concern is looks this is a 5 star microwave. Functionality wise its a 4. Works fine and has enough power to cook food quickly. Doesn't cook potatoes well, they come out overcooked or under cooked. And the potatoes and some other items cook unevenly. Seems fine for frozen dinners though. The display is pretty low tech and some of the buttons are hard to read. But I  this is an RCA... who knew they were even still in business? Overall Im happy with it, and I love the way it looks."
5,Bought this for my mother to use in her Florida condo.  It is small enough for the space she has in her condo.  It heats the food adequately so that my mother's aide is happy with it.  My mother is blind but I put a piece of rough tape on the microwave button that will heat something for  1 minute.  She can now microwave soup or heat up a muffin when she is alone.  Did not have a lot of choices for a microwave this small but this one works for us.
5,"Microwaves food very evenly, plus the automatic return to original position the glass platter does is great mostly because I can open the door during its rotation and stop it from beeping.  The door is also magnetic so I was able to decorate my microwave with a bunch of Super Mario magnets I had.Two things that aren't negatives at all, just observations: First, the microwave has a great seal.  This is good especially for convection cooking but the downside is if you microwave something and it makes a lot of steam, you can get residual water in the cavity for some time if you close the door after retrieving your food.  Just leave the door open for 15 minutes afterwards so you can keep things clean and dry.Secondly, the convection works fine but it's not as good as a standalone air fryer, and the top gets quite warm (not so hot that you can't touch it for a few seconds, but warm enough that I wouldn't keep anything on the top of the microwave).  Give it a lot of space, don't put things on top and you've got a single appliance that microwaves well and air fries passably."
4,Not as powerful as my previous unit. Takes awhile to heat things through.
3,Dislike the fact of no user manualDislike thst yhr power buttons do not light upDislike that in only 2 months the buttons show wear.Would send back if I could or would like a replacement.  Disappointing fir the price paid.
5,"This microwave looked great when I took it out of its packaging, but the first three times I tried to use it, it didn't seem to work. I got frustrated and blamed the microwave, but once I learned to press the buttons just right, it worked perfectly. I had my previous microwave for 23 years and I hope this one might last as long!"
5,I needed a new microwave and I really like this one since it has a heating element inside at the top. I guess this means it is a small electricity which isn’t great but it also means it works better.. so I would recommend this microwave if you’re not overly concerned about the electric bill🙄
5,No complaints all all from me. Will buy this brand again if this ever bites the dust. You will be satisfied!
3,"Update 12/9/22:The clock won’t adjust to daylight savings time.This wouldn’t be a huge issue, but when I manually change it, it goes back by the next morning..This this is unbelievably quiet.It fits in a much smaller space than our last microwave but is more powerful.The app to connect it gets the time set.None of the app features are functional.Alexa integration is broken.It will link, but no commands do anything.I'm keeping it because it's small, powerful, and quiet.If any of those weren't true, I'd probably return it to get better smart integration.I'm literally standing in front of it if I'm putting something inside, so I guess it's not really all that bad."
1,Sounded like a great price for all this Microwave could do....well it would be if you could see the numbers and letters on the panel.....It does not light up...no lighted back panel....it's all hunt and peck even to find the 1 minute....I can't believe GE manufactured it like this ???
5,"Seemed fine, was given as a gift."
5,I am so glad to have this great product...My family is very happy
1,"Right from the start every time I used this it made water pool on the bottom of the microwave ...really weird.But now, not even a year later it sparked and died.Not worth the money."
1,"Its a nice unit. Looks clean and stylish. HOWEVER - The control panel touch pads are garbage. We were excited to try out the new microwave until it came time to use it. It works fine IF you can get it to start. The pads are inherent in the face plate. There's no bump or membrane over each button position. It usually takesmany attempts to make it go. The worst thing about this is you have to push the ""button"" so hard, the microwave slides away as if you were intending to move it. Suggest trying others. I would never buy this again nor recommend it."
4,I really like the oven just one slight problem the dood won't pop open when you push the release button a minor inconvenience other than that it's a great product
1,Door latch broke after 6 months of use and still waiting for reimbursement paper work to replace it . Because they don't have the parts to fix it . Had to take the microwave out of my camper just to have a microwave because of GE replacement procedure. Also Had to take the Microwave apart just to open the door to take a picture of the model and serial number for GE Warranty Department . That's how i got the picture shown
5,The inverter technology is great.  It will heat the food up to the right temperature every time.  It is easy to use and clean.  We also like the size.  You can put a 9 x 1e pan in it and it will cook perfectly.  Highly recommend!
4,Used mostly for defrosting.
1,"I did not expect too much for the price but this is a total piece of chunk. It is super loud; when you set it to 10% power nothing happens and when you set it to 20% it burns as if it's on 100%. I used the frozen meal setting and it overcooked the meat to leather. I don't have time to return it back, I am far too busy for this, but I want others to know. Very disappointing."
5,Excelente producto
5,We are pleased with the functionality of this microwave oven. I It is easy to program and works well.Heating tea water seems to be its primary task.It was well priced. and looks good on the shelf.We used a Panasonic microwave for about 15 years. An Oster microwave lasted 20months. We hope this Farberware model lasts for at least a decade.
2,A year and weeks in this one broke on us... buy at your own risk.
5,Really like the way this thing works. Very quite. Heats much quicker than my old microwave and the convection is pretty cool. The one flaw is that the buttons need to be backlit. After a few months I’ve memorized where the microwave button is but for the longest I would have to get the flashlight on my phone because I keep the microwave in a cabinet that  is not lit. The rest of the oven is awesome. I would recommend either way as most ovens’ buttons are not backlit.
4,"Bought to replace POS Galanz that was supposed to work pretty much the same. Don't have error issues that I constantly had with Galanz. I can boil water, air fry and bake in this GE product, instead of Er30 for which I never found an explanation.Buy THIS, NOT THAT Galanz. Or you may find yourselves with a Galanz Lemon luke me."
4,"Thier literature suggest that if you tell your echo to cook 2 oz of popcorn, it would but no matter what you ask it to cook it will ask for how long. If you ask it to melt butter, it will tell you the microwave doesn't support that function. (You can melt using the smartlife app as remote). Witch is the only place to get the remote. No stand alone. Basically you can just tell it to microwave something for an amount of time.It is cool to control it with your voice but they're selling features it doesn't have.We like the quiet buttons and I love the mute function. All in all it's a good microwave for day1."
1,This microwave had an electrical issue and caught fire. I've had it less than 6 months and this morning it went up in flames while heating up food. My entire apartment was filled with black smoke. I am very angry.
4,"The media could not be loaded.This is the same size as the one I replaced it with.I do like how the inside is grayish in color. My old one was white so I can see the caked in spaghetti sauce spills.This one however is noisier than my last.You can hear it in the video that I uploaded.I kept my old one just in case this breaks down.If anything happens m, I’ll update this review."
5,Nice item.
5,"Work great in my small apartment, I now have so many options. Works great definitely recommend."
1,Received as a wedding gift in March 2017.  This morning I noticed it would turn on by itself while reading 0:00.  Even after unplugging it still will turn on.  After some research it appears the control panel is shot and I am not the only purchaser this has happened to.  This is an extreme fire hazard. So disappointed. Will not purchase this brand again.
3,Didn't last at all and we only use it like once a week as it is.
1,"Dead in less than 2 months. Ominous Error 97 code less than 2 months after purchase. Oven was sent to a certified repair shop. The inverter was bad, thus replaced. Upon receipt, the oven still did not work properly but now was a different issue (oven abruptly stopped mid cycle and turned off). The oven was again sent to the repair shop. I've yet to receive the microwave!"
5,"It’s perfect for me, has lots of features & I really like the way it looks & most of all the smaller size."
5,Easy to set up and use
5,Excellent for my little kitchen! Unbelievably quiet! Handles all my needs for microwave.
5,I replaced my over-the-range microwave with a range hood and purchased this mini counter top model to use for microwaving. It looks great and has nice features. Of course it looks like a child's toy oven when compared to my other microwave (it almost fit inside but was 1 inch too tall). I have a GE French door fridge and the colors match. I would recommend this product.
2,"I was so excited to get this microwave, however I was hit with disappointment!I purchased a new microwave at an expensive price, however i was sent a refurbished & damaged microwave !For starters it was not in it original box, there were finger prints all over AND the door would not eject open !I’m definitely be returning this back, so that I can get my money back !"
1,This microwave came damaged. The button for the door wasn’t able to go in so the door to the microwave wasn’t able to open. Then I noticed I seen it was damaged.
1,"I could've gotten a bigger microwave than this for 99$!! It might work good but the size for the price, not worth it I wouldn't recommend unless it's just for a single person."
1,"Turntable began making noises less than 3 months after purchase.  Still worked, but noise increased to the point that we needed to stop using and unplug. And now the fun part--unbelievable runaround by everyone.  Called Customer Service with Edge Consumer Brands, LLC, which is the number on the back of the Instruction Manual. They took Model #, Serial #, and Manufacture Date and my information and then advised I would be contacted. Nothing. Called back to ask for number of who they forwarded info to and was advised they didn't have a number and could not give me a time frame for contact by who they sent the number to. Tried going through Asurion, and advised extended warranty does not cover yet (as I expected, but needed to try something). Asurion advised contact Farberware Inc.(Lifetime Brands), which directed me to Spectrum (something) who advised could not help. Do not know where to turn at this point, other than to tell you DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! No win!"
4,"This size oven just fit the spot we had for it in the  kitchen.  It does what we need it to do, quietly.  The one thing we dislike is the ""done"" chimes.  They beep five times at the end of the cycle.  Be advised...on this model, unlike some others, you cannot disable that feature."
3,"We purchased this microwave in October of 2017. It served our needs well -- no one in our family (we all used it) complained. In February of 2020, it stopped working and displayed an error message that the local repair person said was more or less fatal -- that is, the high cost of repair would be better spent on a new microwave. Two and a half years is kinda short, but I have come to understand that this is the trend. So happy to be helping the planet."
4,"So far so good. We bought this one to replace a kitchenaid. The inverter type does seem to heat more evenly. Its nice and big, can fit a 9x13 pan easily, the only negative is it does not have a rice button which I used all the time- to do these functions you have to look up a code to key in"
3,"When my Microwave went out, I wanted a dual Microwave and Convection oven.  The Microwave works fine.  But the Convection oven is not great.  I seldom use it.  I hate to turn on my large oven to cook small items.  I will use this since it took me awhile to figure out how to use the convection option.  I now have to find one that will work better."
4,"Bought this microwave after our GE died after only 3 years. This one is a little smaller than the old one but much more powerful. So far, it seems to be a good choice from a size and cost standpoint. The ""buttons"" are a little confusing, as some are squared off as buttons, and others are just words. Would suggest a better design for the control panel, but otherwise, it has been a good microwave for our kitchen."
4,"Decent performance for the price, but expect longer cooking times due to being a 700 watt oven!"
3,This microwave looks nice and has more power than my previous one which is nice.  However it's so loud! If I hadn't thrown away the packaging already I would return it.
1,This is the worst microwave. It has been used very little and in just about 18 months ended up with a hot spot. It also does not have a button for setting specific amount of seconds/minutes. Steer clear!
4,I have replaced it bc I had a white one. The numbers are harder to read bc of the black screen. Other than that it matches my other stainless appliances and works just as well.
2,"This is the Loudest Microwave Oven I have ever used!  If you are looking for a warming tray, this by far gets extremely hot at the top.  It is a feature built into the microwave to keep food warm. However whatever I put on top gets extremely hot, not warm!  In addition, make sure you absolutely have adequate space above your microwave or you will catch your cabinets on fire.  It definitely needs to be on a wide-open space with NOTHING above."
4,I used it as a replacement. I originally had another one in a tight spot  This one fitted in the same spot perfectly
3,"This microwave worked pretty good for the first two years of owning it.  There were a few times when the microwave would just abruptly stop, but overall it was pretty good.  Today, the microwave decided to continue running when opening the door.  Not sure if just the fan and turntable are running or if it is still cooking when this happens.  Doesn't seem safe to use.*UPDATE* I was able to replace one of the 3 KW3A door switches and now the microwave seems to be working fine.  Easy enough and inexpensive fix, but make sure you look up videos on how to safely replace the switch.  You can get seriously hurt or worse if you touch the capacitor, even with the unit unplugged."
4,"I replaced an old microwave oven that was very easy to use by pushing single numbers which yielded full minute values. The new oven has a similar function but you need to add the ""zero's"" or seconds after the first ""minute value"". No problem here. It has two functions that I didn't think I would use but am using all the time now. The ""reheat"" and ""sensor cook"" buttons are great. Reheating leftovers is a breeze, just hit the reheat button and place your item inside (I always use a loose fitted lid on top of my container) and hit START. The same goes for the sensor cook button. You can of course select your own times and power levels, it just takes a little more thought and button selections.  The only things I did not like is the overall size which is a tight fit when allowing ventilation space along the sides and the ""clunky"" door when it closes."
3,"The jury is still out on this one, ive had it two weeks, and not sure if I like it or not. It cooks good and it's a little loud but what I'm concerned about is that with the door open you can hear a weird noise inside, like the crackle you would hear as an old light bulb comes on? The first couple nights I had it, there was a weird smell like some newness burning off or something. I haven't smelled it anymore but the noise inside is still there. I may have it looked at, I like the color scheme and it cooks like a champ."
5,"A very nice Microwave to replace an old broken one, we are enjoying how quiet it is when running along with when time is up beeper does not continue to beep until door is open, the door handle is much easier to use than the old one that had a push button. Delivery was very good with box no dents or damage."
2,"The media could not be loaded.I have had 2 units, both units after a short period of use began flashing the interior light just like a strobe!  The light in the unit becomes intermittent and often strobes rapidly and brightly while in operation  or simply opening the door.  The first unit the flashing light faded to a dim light and then stopped working. Yes both the new one and the new replacement was less than 2 months old when this started!I microwave cook bacon in it on a covered paper plate and it creates a lot of moisture inside.  The Inefficient fan does nothing to minimize the moisture that coats the inside and puddles!  This is the cause of the light defect!Right now the replacement unit still heats and operates but the light is flashing all the time like a strobe, which is more than annoying.  It flashes in your eyes and face when you the door is open too.  This is a HUGE aggravation as often the light is out completely.Company refused to replace under warranty, Simply Refunded money. Contact with Amazon brought a quick shipment of replacement unit that repeated the same defect!  It's still defective.  Very Disappointed!I have an extended warranty that only applies after the Manufacturer warranty.  The warranty was registered specific to the first model I had, and is not usable on this 2nd (That I am aware of. It was registered by serial number to the returned model)."
2,"Hello,I am sending this message to notify you that my microwave has become a hazard and I will need a replacement. Recently when I had used the microwave, I had placed my food in it per usual, and moved away from it to attend to my work when after some time I had smelled something peculiar. When I went to go check on the microwave, I had seen smoke was rising profusely from the exits. After doing my best to clean it, it still smells excessively of smoke and when I tried to use it once again after the incident, I had seen what looked like smoke formulating inside of it. I am concerned that by continuing to try to use the microwave it may cause a fire, and I do not feel safe having it with the state it is in now. Is it possible that you could please send me a replacement? I sincerely appreciate your assistance."
5,"This is a cheap black box that makes things you put inside of it get hot, and (if used improperly) catch fire or explode. It contains a magnetron nuclear accelerator and shielding made of what is effectively high-grade tin foil. Living in the future is weird.The construction feels about as solid as much more expensive units, the controls are simple but do everything you'd expect for a microwave oven (with no thermometer probe), and it'll fit a dinner plate.… or probably a chicken, a three-layer, 9"" birthday cake, about a hundred Linkin Park CD's, or all ten Barbie dolls that your daughter didn't want after all because she's more into trucks."
2,On about day 50 the door latch began sticking in the closed position. This Conveniently took place 20 days past my return period so I guess I am stuck with it. Other than that it works great and if it was not for the door issue I would give it a 5 star. Lets see if Amazon reads this and decides to replace my defective Microwave.
4,"Very feature-packed convection microwave oven with an extremely [difficult to find] stainless steel interior cavity at a reasonable price. I only docked one star due to the fact that Toshiba, which is a reputable Japanese company, decided to manufacture these in China. Quality seems on-par with Toshiba’s standards and it’s intuitively designed user interface makes it simple to use."
2,The box the microwave came in was Damaged. When I took the microwave out the Box. It had a Dent” in the back of it. Very unappreciated on that one.
5,"Best Microwave we have ever owned. Let's start with dislike. First of all the app is not available in the Amazon App Store. Only Apple and Google, neither will do you much good if you're using a Kindle or other  Amazon product.  I do have an iPhone (unfortunately– that's just an editorial comment) which has Alexa and it would not pair even though the skill was enabled. Called Amazon Customer Service and spoke to James (I wish I could remember his last name) who was absolutely awesome.He checked with the Alexa engineers who diagnosed the issue and were absolutely sure it was not their problem. This took a little over a week and he called back every few days to give me an update. Eventually I was told I had to check with  Toshiba they were polite but not helpful. The CSR did give me a service ticket number, and told me they would be in touch in a couple of days – which they didn't do. I called Toshiba back in a week and they told me that Amazon made them fully aware of the problem and asked for my patience.James from Amazon called back exactly when he said he would. I told him situation with Toshiba and he asked to be informed via email what was going on. On a different order I had a return that needed Supervisory Authorization, nothing serious - all is good. I spoke to a supervisor by the name of Jona who was absolutely incredible. As a former salesman and customer service manager I expect the best and believe me she is!  Jona said she would call me back; she gave me a specific time and date and both times it was exactly as she said.Back to the microwave. Jona must've lit a fire under somebody's chair because the microwave and Alexa are now a team. it's FAST, it's EASY and it's ACCURATE if a mistake were to be made it was because we said something wrong not the handshake between Alexa and the microwave.We purchased the Alexa enabled appliance because my wife has rheumatoid  arthritis. This product along with several other kitchen appliance and gadgets we purchased from Amazon have helped ease the pain. Frankly, when I saw that there were now appliances compatible with Alexa I thought that was going to extremes (AND we have six Echo products around the house).This 1100w Toshiba is the perfect size 700w is too small even for two people.. I generally don't take the time I should to write a review; but this microwave deserves five stars. By the way Amazon customer service deserves 10 five each for Jona and James."
5,"I just love this microwave.  The one touch is so convenient, perfect for counter top."
1,"I would not purchase this product again.  The keypad is very difficult to read unless you have a bright light shining directly on it.  We keep a flashlight next to the unit.  The keypad should be backlit, or the writing should be larger.  The keystroke process is not intuitive.  The process to simply bake something for 45 minutes requires reading the manual several times and even then you won't know if you have it correct.  The unit gets very hot on top and on the back.  Too hot to touch.  We were going to put it in the microwave slot in the upper cabinets; however, I don't believe it will get enough air flow and could be a fire hazard.  This is not a very well thought out product.  I seldom write reviews, but this product is not a good choice and we wasted our money."
4,I really like this microwave but the interior just isn’t bright enough
2,Works fine. Opening and closing the door it feels and sounds very Plastic and noisey.Make sure everything works fine..........after 30 days you SOL.The push button to open door stop working in just a couple months.Nearest repair center 95 miles away. You pay to get it there and back.Buy another one .............its cheaper
3,Direction manual is online. Very confusing and hard to figure out how to use the convection feature.
4,My first microwave was a Sharp Carousel bought in 1983. 36 years later it just stopped working. Just bought a new Sharp & the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it has a ring under the turntable. My first Sharp had a turntable that sat directly on the rotator (no ring). Wish this one did too. Otherwise it's great! Hope it lasts another 36 years! Haha...
3,"The microwave itself works but the packaging foam used for the inside plate protection has to be the dumbest thought process ever. The plate shattered during shipping since the inside foam is too small and still allows the plate to move around. If you do not need a microwave right away and can afford to go through the return trouble until you get a plate that's not broken, Order this!"
1,Peeled off factory sticker - shipped in plain brown box and no factory paperwork - dented top and control panel was hanging off.  This was advertised as a new product and was $115.00.  This is a used microwave.  Fraud alert.
2,Disappointed and returned item. Very noisy during convection and didn’t cook well. Hard to read the keyboard. Terrible instruction manual!
4,"It's heavy; around 40 pounds. To enter cook time and power level can be frustrating. The numbers can be hit or miss.On this unit you actually press the letters that read 'Cook Time' rather than the rectangle below. Make sure you fingers are dry. About half the time I have to start over as when I meant to press 3 a 6 shows. That could be me just being clumsy. It is certainly more difficult to enter the setting than my previous GE microwave. However, I am happy with it's performance."
5,It’s Ok
1,I have ordered this product twice & both times The item received had green LED lights. Why does the description say it’s blue lights?
2,This microwave is very very very weak. It takes several minutes to heat even a small bowl of soup and then sometimes it’s still only luke warm. If I could return this I would.
4,"So far this microwave has done a really nice job heating things up for me. I primarily use it to reheat food and heat up my tea in the morning. I really like the safety lock feature because I have curious kids. My old microwave didn't have that. I found one area, which I pictured, that I didn't love the craftsmanship with the stainless steel. It wasn't a very clean and nice look at one of the corners. I love being able to set a time and power level for an item to cook and then, add a second time and power level for it to change to mid-cook. That's really nice! Sometimes you don't want things cooking at 100 % the whole time. It's a pretty straight forward microwave that has worked well for me so far. It is kind of loud though. Sometimes it settles in and is quiet but the next time I use it it is a bit loud again. Not sure what that is about. I put it on different surfaces to see if that would fix the problem, but it didn't. The instructions are very clear making it easy to figure out how to use the microwave in every way."
4,Hard to read for old people like me with not super vision. Our unit is on a work bench below eye level and must look down to see panel wording. For those who have a vision problem suggest the White unit with Black working. Was thinking of returning for a White model but return time has run out...my bad.
4,"If your looking for a standard size microwave, that is mainly used to heat up leftovers, then this has you covered!I'm more of an oven lover, but the microwave comes in handy. This is a simple and straight forward microwave. It does the job, I mean, what more can you ask from a microwave?"
5,Great deal for the brand name.  Don’t know why though it gets a lot of water condensation.  Never had that w other micro.
4,"When our 4-year old Kenmore microwave suddenly gave up the ghost last week, my wife and I researched various brands and models to replace it. Our approach started with ""anything BUT another Kenmore"", but soon narrowed to the Panasonic line.In matters of kitchen appliances, I defer to my Spousal Unit, so when she selected this particular model, I endorsed her decision without delay. Well...neither of us paid attention to the external dimensions of this highly-reviewed model, so when a Volkswagen-sized carton arrived at our front doorstep, my wife was shocked and alarmed. (I was off playing in a golf tournament, so I remained blissfully unaware of her reaction.) When I got home that evening, I collided with the box much as the RMS Titanic must have struck that fatal iceberg! ""It must just be very well-packed,"" I thought, but when I opened the carton, we both gasped at the immensity of the glass turntable plate, which foretold just how cavernous the interior chamber must be!My beloved Spousal Unit was tired, and I was tired, so I suggested that we just leave it packed, and take up the decision process after a good night's sleep. She reminded me that I had to be at work at 5:30 a.m. the next morning, and she really didn't want to put off having a microwave oven for another day. (We have truly become an MD household...""Microwave Dependent""...) So, I unpacked that Moby Dick of an appliance, and hoisted it on top of the countertop where the diminutive Kenmore once inconspicuously reposed. We retained the box and packing material just in case, but I was sincerely hoping that despite its humungous size, the USS Panasonic was here to stay.It's indeed still here, because: 1) We have become somewhat accustomed to its looming bulk, and 2) It performs magnificently!POSITIVES: Easy to use controls...one quick read of the instructions provided the info needed to operate the microwave effectively; Fast, efficient cooking. Heating a bowl of soup takes a minute less than our old microwave, yet without any boilover or splattering. The soup was heated perfectly and evenly; It's a little louder than the late Kenmore, but the beeps signaling completion of the cooking cycle are about 50db quieter, so we no longer have to wait until after 7:00 a.m. to use it, (the neighbors complained about the noise); The LED interior light provides a better view of whatever's cooking, so no more guessing if the chili is about to explode, or just bubbling hot.NEGATIVES: While it's too early to rate this oven's reliability or longevity, my wife has commented that the door and latch mechanism feel ""tinny"", not solid. Of course, the late, unlamented Kenmore had a very solid sounding door, so this may not be an accurate predictor; It's HUUUUUUGE!!!I promise to provide an updated review should anything go sideways, but for now, we're very okay with this reasonably-priced microwave oven."
5,"This Mini GE microwave is better than the full size Magic Chef it replaced, and doesn't cover up my beautiful new backsplash. Microwave Popcorn comes out perfectly every time. Unfortunately, this was not the case with the full size Magic Chef. If you're on the fence, get it."
5,I am so glad that I purchased this microwave. It has been a blessing because of my medical issues that prevent me from standing too long to prepare and cook my meals.Ii is easy to use and clean. I love the display because it is easy to read and the instructions that came with it are easy to understand.I love cooking in it.
3,There is nothing i dislike about this microwave besides it makes some pretty weird sounds. We had to replace our old microwave bc it started catching fire on the inside and made some sketch sounds. The new one is making the same sketch sounds along with some other weird sounds. We have had a few microwaves over the years and have never had this issue besides when it is at the end of its life. We have only had this one for about a month or so. We are going to keep it anyway bc it works as it should but are concerned with how long it will last. Will you try to remember to update if anything changes.
2,Takes 6 minutes on high heat to warm up a bowl of soup. Bag of popcorn takes 4 minutes. Enough said. Save your money and put it towards something that does LITERALLY ITS ONLY JOB.
3,"Awkward is all I can say. Hard to manage without a handle on the door. Glass microwave plate has no notches to fit correctly without movement. Also seems off-center. But if you can get past that, it is working fine."
3,Hard to read keyboard on shadow of cabinets above.
1,"I bought this product in Feb 2022. It broke in Nov 2022. I was heating up water (material: glass, microwave safe) for tea, and the metal plates inside burned and caught fire. This product is not safe."
4,Heats food quickly and accepts large items.  Have to push the latch fast and hard or it just comes ajar without opening.  They should have put a quality latch on an otherwise excellent product.
2,"So I bought this microwave maybe a month ago. I noticed the ventilation wasn’t good at all seeing that every time I used it, it would smoke a lot. Yesterday I had to go buy a whole new microwave because I was cooking in this one and all of the sudden it just died. Nothing digital was on the screen anymore. I thought maybe it was my outlet but it wasn’t. The microwave just literally stopped. When I would try to plug it back in it would smell like it was going to catch fire. That smell was coming from the back of the microwave. Not really happy that I’ve already had to replace a microwave."
2,Tied a cotton twine around the top heating element. After an hour on air fry it only turned dark brown. Air fryer doesn't work. Waste of money.
5,Me gusta y es muy silencioso y practico
5,"I just moved into a retirement apartment, they serve 2 meals a day, but we don’t have much of a kitchen. Not a big selling point for me.  I love to bake. When I moved in there was a tiny little microwave that went with the apartment. Sooooo I opened my Amazon app. I chose the ToshibaEC042A5C-SS I was a little apprehensive I had tried convection ovens before and I was not a fan.It arrived quickly, it was well packaged with plenty of shock absorbing material. It was very heavy and very large.  I needed help to get it on the kitchen cart. The microwave worked great, the oven surprised me, I am very pleased with it. I have baked cookies, chocolate croissants, a cake, and brownies.  It did the job. I haven’t tried the combination settings yet. Don’t leave anything on the top of this oven when using convection setting, the top does get hot. I’m happy with this oven, it does a marvelous job."
4,I like all of the awesome features. But wish ithad Express Cooking 1-9.
4,"Enough said. It's terrific. The only thing I would change is the location of the Start/On button. Otherwise, it works like a dream."
4,"I like the smaller size of this convection microwave.  Most are too large for my space, or they have a very large fan portion protruding from the back.  This oven does a good job of microwaving, air frying and convection cooking.  I have not used the broil feature.The oven runs quietly in all modes.  The fan is not overly loud.  I like the venting on the side rather than in the back like most convection ovens have.  This only needs one inch clearance from the wall in the back.The only thing I don't like about this appliance is the beeping--that is horribly loud, and it can't be turned off or turned down.  I find the sound to be quite irritating and it would be a better overall experience if one had the option to disable that feature."
4,Good buy
5,"After many years of service, my GE SpaceMaker II microwave needed to be replaced. Unfortunately, the line has been discontinued by GE. They offer one model that's close to the dimensions, but the size would not work well for the space I have (built-in shelf). While there are lots of compact microwaves, the issue is the depth -- most are too deep to fit on a wall shelf.This has the proper depth for sitting on a shelf without issue provided that you use a flat pig-tail adapter so that the plug doesn't jut out and prevent the microwave from sitting close to the wall. The width is less than the nearly 24 inches of the SpaceMaker, but I filled the empty shelf space with a storage cannister that I found that matches the microwave.The microwave itself is a basic model that has few bells and whistles. I only use the microwave to reheat leftovers, and this does a fine job of that. Heating is even, and the 700W, while low powered compared with larger microwaves, gets the job done just fine. The controls are easy to use and are very similar to the SpaceMaker controls, which was a plus for me. The fit and finish are much better than other compact microwaves I looked at. It will fit a full-size dinner plate without issue.It's not a perfect replacement for the SpaceMaker, but it's a workable one. It provides good functionality as a basic compact microwave, looks much nicer than you would expect for the price point, and is easy to use. A very good value for the price, especially if you can catch it on a price dip. Five stars."
5,Does what it needs to do
3,"I like the microwave itself, but...The plastic coating on the touchpad tore within 6 weeks of light use...two weeks beyond my Amazon return window...which leaves me at the mercy of the dreaded Panasonic warranty support. Luckily, my nearest authorized repair facility is only 20 miles away. I will update after seeing how THAT process goes.I read the reviews about Panasonic warranty horror stories before I purchased, and I gambled that I would get a problem-free product. I wish I had gone with my first instinct and bought another brand, even at a higher cost."
2,"Great looking small counter top microwave.  Very under powered though.  Even checked the power level, it's set appropriately.  Just takes longer to cook with this one."
3,"What I like about this model:--many shortcuts and programming: I rarely have to push more than one or two buttons even for multi-step tasksWhat I don't like about this model:--when it finishes, the display reverts to clock instead of saying ""end"" or ""open"" or anything else to remind me that there's something I need to take out--VERY WEAK FAN: it does a terrible job of removing moisture from the interior, resulting in standing water that boils away and is destroying the structure of the machine. I've had it less than two years, and am waiting for the day it shorts out."
3,I brought this microwave in February and it lasted until June 28th. The wires in the back started burning and had to be quickly unplugged. I’m not sure why but it was good while it lasted.
5,Works very easy and comes with good instructions and racks to use.
2,"To say I’m dissatisfied is an understatement. Two years old and it has decided to spark when you press start. Thank goodness the 7 year old wasn’t using it! I loved this microwave. Perfect size, right color and easy to use touchpad. Now, it sparks on the exterior back side."
2,This unit def heats well but it lacks EXPRESS buttons that have become standard and expected on a microwave oven.  The plastic that the plate resta on inside become dislodged too easily when removing or placing items inside.  The cooking level cannot be adjusted during the cooking cycle.
2,The microwave works great. Have tried multiple times to connect it to the internet and use it with Alexa but will not connect
4,"This is the third Panasonic Genius Microwave we’ve had in seven years. It works great while it works! They’re not very reliable, but they’re the only microwave that is a good fit to our available space."
3,"Nice looking, but very noisy."
1,"It arrived broken , severely dented and un useable."
4,"This microwave I just installed in our fifth wheel travel trailer. When looking online it gave me the measurements of 19.5 x 11“. This was said to be the exterior measurements. When we installed it it is too small for where we wanted to put it above the stove. Now I either have to Jerry rig a way to keep it from moving around or buy a grate to fit it. The exterior measurements are only 19“ x 10“. This makes a difference when you’re putting it in a moving vehicle. It is a bit noisy but that I can live with. Just a little frustrated about the extra work or money I’m going to have to spend to make it work in our travel trailer, Which is our home."
3,It is hard to understand the directions.  Otherwise it is cute and small on my counter.
1,Very noisy and smoked when I used it.
4,Its great
3,Makes a lot of noise
4,So far it seems to be working well and I have been able to figure out how to use the functions I use most often. I like that it has a handle for the door rather than just a button to push to open the door.
5,"I'd wanted to buy a new microwave/convection oven to replace an older, smaller Magic Chef that has the same exterior footprint with a smaller interior.  After much research, I decided that the Toshiba was precisely what I was looking for -- energy efficiency, same space on my counter, bigger capacity, and the option to combo-cook. Amazon was out of stock for almost a month and it was worth the wait! I donated the Magic Chef as soon as I put the Toshiba through its paces. Quiet operation? Check. Fast pre-heat? Check. Ability to turn off annoying beep alerts, and energy efficiency mode? Check! Ability to combo-cook items like whole chicken (using convection with a hint of microwave cooking)? Check. It performs as well as (or better) than another microwave/convection oven that I purchased in the past at more than double the price. I'm delighted with this purchase, and I highly recommend you consider adding this to your appliance collection."
3,"After using a few times it ran very hot. The glass turn table was hot to the touch with nothing on it. If you used unit for  five minutes twice, back to back it would shutdown, turning off all power. After 10 minutes or so it would come back on. The clock time would need to be reset. The same issue again.I did like the unit, good size and features. It also matches my stove. I returned for a replacement to Amazon in under 30 days.Fortunately I noticed it was overheating before it damaged my brand new counter top in a completely  redone kitchen. Replacing the counter would be thousands of dollars. Didn't see anything in manual about possible overheating and any concern about counter you put it on. My learned lesson is always test out  a microwave very closely before putting it on the counter"
3,"I have a cutout in my kitchen that perfectly fit my broken microwave.  Unfortunately, I didn't have too many options because of that fact.  Consumer Reports say that Panasonic was one of the better microwaves out there so that is why I looked for the brand.  Sadly, the dimensions are very misleading and inside the microwave is a small capacity.  The sound when in use is not too loud and that is the same for the alarm when setting the timer.  You won't hear the timer in another room.  I reviewed the instructions and the power level needs to be reset every time depending on the food.  Also, I thought it wouldn't bother me but setting the heating time is really a pain.  You have to press too many buttons to set the time you want.  The button to open the door requires no pressure on a couple occasions, I thought it was broken.  I am pretty sure that the door close button will be the first to go.  I didn't return it because I use the microwave for reheating only and it is not a major appliance for my kitchen.  It is an OK microwave and I am on the fence if I would ever recommend this brand/model.The dimensions for the exterior of the unit are 20 1/8 inch wide, 13 3/4 inch deep, and 12 inches from feet to the top.  There product description has 2 other dimensions noted, not the same as the product I received."
2,We used it to make popcorn using the icon for popcorn but it didn’t pop most of it so we add 30 second and it burned it. It makes uncomfortable noise
4,"Heats most foods very well in a timely manner.  My Presto Power Pop will not fully pop all kernels with such low wattage, though.  Oven is a real keeper."
2,"After only three and a half months the left most number on the time display stopped working. Also, this is the noisiest microwave oven I've ever owned."
4,"Is there a reason GE made it hard/almost impossible to read the panel without a high beam flash light?It's a cute little microwave with functions I need, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone without special night vision since I don't understand the logic that GE development team thought it was cool to make the letters on the panel in grey and dimm."
3,It’s worth the price. My only issue is it was the exact heating specs as my last one but i have to add about 10% longer cooking time no matter what percentage the settings are on. I am still satisfied with the price and product.
4,I would have preferred one with a slightly larger footprint of the same height.
2,"Haven't used yet, but totally P.O'd. Box came with ""Quik Guide"" manual. WORTHLESS!!. 6 pages of mostly safety instructions!! Saw a lot of reviews which said the same thing!! So this a  ""Supposedly 4 in 1 ( Microwave, Convection, Air Fryer, Broiler). The Quick Guide doesn't even mention Convection or Broiler, only a little about Air Fry. I bought this for my wife because of the Convection mode at a price of almost $200!!! Plus the box was really beat up, looked like rats were nibbling across the top, although product looks OK.  Also 2 trivit  racks are included. It says use the large rack for Air Frying. What the hell is the small rack for?? Hate to return it. VERY heavy. Send me a main manual & I'll give it a try."
2,The push button pad is not ergonomically friendly.This is the second Panasonic that only last a couple of years.they just were made to burn out over a short time and changing the fuse does not work.
5,Great very very satisfied
5,"I've owned this microwave for almost 5 years. I love the large capacity and high wattage. It heats well and as evenly as any other microwave. The defrost works better than any other microwave I've owned and the ""beep"" is not overly loud or irritating. I gave 4 stars for features/user interface because changing the power level is not very intuitive (but not difficult once you understand it). Also, it sweats slightly inside but that may be due to me having on a shelf limiting air flow around the appliance. I simply leave the door open to allow the moisture to dissipate or dry it with a rag. I've been very pleased with the performance and reliability. It was a good buy. I'm buying a second microwave for our new house and will purchase the same again. This one will stay in our guest house."
1,"I purchased this microwave on March 15, 2021 and it malfunctioned into obsolescence just 2 weeks before turning 2 years old. I did not have any problems with it during that time and it was used at a minimum daily to reheat coffee for 90 seconds. When I was reheating coffee in a ceramic mug on March 1, 2023 for 90 seconds, 5 seconds in the side panel on the right interior was on fire (see photo). Research indicates that the average life expectancy for a microwave oven is 7 years. I expected that for nearly $200, this microwave oven should've lasted a few years at least. Very disappointing."
4,"Back light on panel buttons would be a wonderful additional feature.Because of the exterior being painted metal it will scratch easily if you put items on the top. Functionally the unit works well, seems to heat both quickly and evenly."
4,"We needed a new microwave for our office, however didn't want to spend a ton on one.  After reading other reviews that said it would fit a 10 inch plate in it, I figured why not.  It is little, perfect for a small space, but does the trick for reheating lunches, which is the only thing we needed it for.  I did hear a few crumbles from co-workers about it being small, but too bad...."
3,"This microwave sucks, it doesn't even melt cheese or come with a manual. I would not recommend this microwave for any reason. It's really freaking loud and even when you shut the door it continues. I would turn off the volume but mine didn't come with a manual so I don't know how. It's cheaply made except it wasn't cheap and it barely even works."
2,"I purchased Toshiba EC042A5C-SS Countertop Microwave Oven with Convection, Smart Sensor, Sound On/Off Function and LCD Display, 1.5 Cu.ft, Stainless Steel for limited use in my office. After over a year it getting trouble but I managed to continue. Finally its LED bulb died so I communicate with the Toshiba USA customer care and really shocked to know that I need to change the entire unit due to bulb died. I paid over $250 and Toshiba can't fix it and I need to buy the new one again."
3,Product got pretty warm exteriorly and a lot of condensation inside the microwave when cooking. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,I liked the microwave for my elderly dad but it started smoking and was about to catch on fire after just 18 months of use.  I really would have expected more from this brand.  Good thing his caregiver was alert and has now unplugged it!
5,"My Amana Radar Range finally fizzled out after 36 years of devoted service with no problems. I dreaded buying a new one. I did a lot of research, looking at lots of reviews on lots of sites, and it became even more confusing. The only thing that made me hesitate on this one was the occasional reviews of things catching fire. I certainly didn't want that. Apparently, though, it was mostly a popcorn situation and we don't make popcorn, so that became moot. And now that I have the oven, I see that there are three different popcorn settings, and I figure people weren't using the correct setting.My previous oven had no bells and whistles - you just set the cooking level and the time. It did no thinking for you. I was hesitant to use the ""thinking"" features on this newfangled machine, but I have since tried a few and am totally delighted with the features. Reheating is done magically. Defrosting is just a matter of entering the weight of the item (which took me a couple tries to figure out how to do, but once I did it was fantastic.) I had forgotten to thaw my dog's food pack one day, and so I put the frozen brick of food in the oven, entered the weight and crossed my fingers. 6 minutes later, doggie was happily munching away!! I haven't used all the features yet, and frankly, I probably won't, (just like with all the features of my cell phone) but I am really happy I bought this. We've had it a while now, and are totally satisfied. I admit, I'm a bit shamed by having an appliance that's smarter than I am, but that's par for the course in these modern times.It was interesting that the price was much higher for all black than for the combo silver and black. I suppose the later is intended for built in, but since aesthetics don't matter to me, I saved the hundred bucks and went for the two-tone. I have three different colors of appliances in my kitchen, so I didn't care about this fitting in."
3,I was kind of shocked I thought this was the same size as another one I got but this is smaller it’s pretty but pretty doesn’t cook food my brother said he wished I had told him I wanted a microwave he would’ve gotten me one for Christmas and then just sent me the picture on Christmas you know an early Christmas present thing now I have to come tell him I screwed up I don’t want to have to try and return this But I love to cook and I use all kinds of appliances it’s only the microwave is one of them so I’ll try it for a week it drives me crazy I got to get a new one
4,"The red is only on the front trim. The microwave itself is black. It's a very good looking microwave which I bought to replace my old white one. The size, wattage and controls are the same so there was no learning curve. I cook everything in the microwave so they get lots of usage. If this lasts as long as my old hand-me-down it will be incredibly inexpensive."
1,"I bought this microwave because it was under a hundred bucks and delivered next day. I should have waited. This microwave is a piece of junk, the time buttons barely respond, and there’s no door open button which leaves you to pry open the door just by the amount of grip your fingers can get on the glossy door. It also has an aggressive chemical smell to it, which worsens when you use it. I wish I had just spent the extra 20 bucks to get a decent microwave."
5,"I see a lot of reviews talking about how people can't fit the refrigerator inside it - im here to tell you this is big enough for any reasonable sized person - and I can almost rest assured the people leaving bad reviews are on my 600 pound life - but I digress , the sound is non existent so if you hear sound you may want to PLUG THIS ONE IN BEFORE writing misleading reviews - it also heats everything up very fast , has a sleek look but the plate rotates on the inside  - easy to use buttons , my ex could use it !"
2,It was smaller than I thought it was going to be.  You need to double the time to do anything.  Disappointing.
1,"So I got this a few months ago and noticed it smelled funny when using it, didn't think much of it. Then a few weeks later I started noticing little bugs in the digital timer area, thought,  ok we get ants sometimes maybe they got in there. Then weeks go by and I start seeing roaches around my house particularly in the kitchen area. We've never had roaches before ever. I call the exterminator, explain everything. Exterminator comes opens up the microwave on the side, like took the side off, it was FULL OF ROACH EGGS AND ROACHES!!! Yuck!!!! So this little under microwave ended up costing me $185 for the exterminator to come, then $75/month for the next year to keep treating my house so they don't come back. I really wish Amazon would refund my money and pay my exterminator costs, but who knows. I'm so disgusted and upset over this. After the initial exterminator costs plus the costs of having the roach treatments for the next year this microwave is costing me $1010! Do not buy!"
5,This microwave oven is perfect for the dorm room
1,"Bought it in july 2023 from amazon, dead by sept.  tried to get technical help but all I got was led to massage chairs, chat is a dead end and the call back number for spt called me back about 5 minutes later and hung up on me. there tech help is non exist. we don't have the money to throw away, and no one wants to try and fix it.thanks amazong felder"
2,"The light comes on inside, but the keypad is dead."
5,"It works great, I bought the small one so far so good!"
4,Two things we do not like. The touch pad does not light up which makes the touch pad screen hard to read. Also our microwave sits in an island cabinet to be aware when using the air fryer that it creates heat.
1,I bought this to go into my semi I got it and put it in my truck and it don’t work it won’t heat anything so I bought a biggger inverter that’s cost me 300 dollars and it still don’t work so I’m done buying from amazon. I’m a over the road trucker I keep America running I’m very upset
4,"Great-looking microwave, but fairly underpowered (900W). Just be aware that everything you cook is going to take about 20% longer than you might be used to. Has a defrost feature that is based on weight and works really well -- but takes a fairly long time."
2,"Only lasted me 3 years, part of touch panel stopped workingI have to unplug it each time I need to clear the cook time/clock."
1,"This was a nice microwave. But then again, microwaves, as long as they have a turntable, are a decent size and work are pretty similar. It is a good size. It is easy to operate and clean. But it failed in the durability department. We bought this microwave on 4/22/17. It was used on a daily basis by two people. It died on 1/4/19. Though I did not expect it to last forever, it did not even make it to two years."
4,"I had never used different power mode until I bought this microwave.  I've never really liked microwaves for things like hot pockets, spring rolls, etc.  The inside is boiling when the outside is warm.Using a lower power mode seems to solve that problem."
3,Works good but it’s made in China.
3,"It may be exactly as advertised -- I don't know. However, it is smaller than I realized it would be, and I can no longer use my microwave popcorn maker (a fancy bowl) to make popcorn. Back to the stove to make popcorn!"
1,"The beep can't be shut off like on other ones, this is the first Ive seen without the ability to mute the beep. I was so pissed I just threw the whole new thing in the garbage."
4,The control panel lightdoes not stay on when not in use.  The clock doesn't stay lit either.  Difficult to see .
1,"I have several issues and complaints with this microwave.Intermittently makes a loud, annoying rattling noise like loose metal rubbing together when runningAlexa functionality is extremely unreliable, it often loses its connection and has non stop issues with using Alexa (more details on how bad this is below)You have to push cook time 2 times to set a cook time,  the first push changes the clock,  2nd push to set cook time.. this is backwards and unintuitive and at idle the colon in the clock flashes like it's not actually set even though it is.The timer makes no sound rendering it useless in the kitchen,  before this microwave I used my microwave timer all the time, wish the timer on this one made sound when time runs out.Alexa integration is abysmal at best.  I have tons of smart home devices and I'm an IT tech by trade and even I have constant issues using this microwave with Alexa. Sometimes I'm able to get it working for awhile but it will inevitably require tinkering for it to work with Alexa again once it stops out of the blue, which happens frequently. As a matter of fact out of the dozens and dozens of smart home devices I use on a daily bases this ranks dead last as the worst one I've dealt with. At the time of writing this I can't get it to work at all. It's not just me either, the skill in the Alexa app has an utterly abysmal 1 star rating.I'm going to try to get a warranty / refund on this, but my previous attempts to get customer support got me nowhere before I ran out of time available to spend on trying."
4,Don't like to have to figure out defrost times.
5,"We purchased this item for our kitchen at work. We needed something cheap that was basic and easy to work. This microwave is ideal for the workplace, college dorm room, etc. It works as needed.It's small enough not to take up a lot of space--but large enough to function as needed."
3,"It's loud, runs loudly and the auto settings make no sense"
1,"This item worked fine until it stopped, after 9 months.  It's going to the dump without me knowing if it just needed a simple fix.  Down the drain is a number of hours of my life after going through Panasonic's online self-help toubleshooting pages, none of which helped, my self or anyone.  No troubles were shot.  My attempts at a ""chat"" were met with an error message telling me there was no such page where my description of my problem was ""submitted"" from Panasonic's own help page. Calling was interesting.  Back and forth with a number that rang without answer and a number answered by a recording of a person who apparently was in a cave or a well.  The recording said they were closed at this time, which was around 11 am Pacific time.  I live in a tiny little village called Seattle.  So the nearest Panasonic service center is an hour away. To be followed by going round and round about my warranty."
4,"Best for this size. Very powerful, easy to use, but some minor issues:pros:a. compact but spacey inside 11 inch plate - easy.b. very easy to use (classic one button operation)c. press 1 and coldest juice is warm 12oz cup. Press 2 and it will be very hot.ventilation is good enough.(always cover to avoid problems, and to prolong it's life.cons:a. Noisy on any sound inducing surfaces; wood,metal,glass...- no soft pads under . DIYb. 5 times beep sound really unnecessary.c. Interior lamp is bright, but getting hot (it should be a led light)d. To open and close not only discomfortable, but a stone age (20 years old design),makes this unpleasant. You have to press hard a huge wiggling 'open button'...but after that, doors open-power can brake a full class of tea.Note: even with some cones it still classic easy to use (incorporating quiet a few innovations; like watt setup, that makes this device versatile cooking machine...not only warming) Highly recommend!"
5,"bought it for my daughters dorm room, perfect size, right price, easy to use, looks great too!"
3,"It is smaller than I thought, the glass rotating plate has a hard time staying on. It slides around...but it does cook hot."
3,"Fit and finish are good, it works fine. I replaced it because its old predecessor was interfering with my WiFi network- this is something that happens and that hasn't been a problem with this unit. However, comments about difficulty reading the legends on the keypad are correct, unless you're looking straight-on with good light it's really tough to see what the buttons say. Also, its auto-reheat is not as good as the unit I had before. Sometimes food is insufficiently heated, sometimes too little."
1,"I loved this for a cheap, easy, small microwave. But it just died :(. Right at the one year mark."
3,"It is louder than my previous microwaves. Not bad, just louder"
3,"My main requirement for a micro is that it be easy to use.  I don't cook with the micro, it's a kitchen tool, like my blender, or my knives, so it needs to be super easy to use, one touch, something to aid my cooking, not do my cooking.This thing has too many necessary steps to work, for me.  As an example, if I want to give a quick warm up to my coffee, I want to stick it in and hit one button, but not with this micro - the coffee goes in, then you must push the beverage button, then you must read the screen, it's asking you how many cups are inside, then you pick, ""1"", then you hit start.  Too complicated to just give a few seconds to a lukewarm cup of java.  Also, for 1 cup, it puts 1:06 (one minute, 6 seconds) on the timer.  It assumes you've got refrigerator-cold liquid inside and you want it hot.  I just had lukewarm coffee that I wanted to heat up so I could finish drinking it and it made the coffee so hot that I couldn't touch the cup, and my coffee tasted horrible after it cooled down to a drinkable temp.  That entire process, from start to finish, to warm up a cup of coffee, was just too much (especially in the morning, when I need that cup of coffee!!).  This is the first microwave I've seen that doesn't have a 30-second or 1-minute button, for just this thing, to ""nuke"" something for just a few seconds.  Microwaves are for convenience, it would seem a convenient 30-second button would be mandatory.  So, if I've set the veggies on the table, and they've cooled off, I want to zap them for 15-30 seconds, again, I want one-touch, not 4 steps, including reading the screen.I can understand how this would be a nice feature if one does some actual cooking in a micro, so if you do want a higher level of function, beyond just a tool to do a quick heat, or a pre-cook (like baked potatoes), this micro would be for you.  If you just use it, like I do, as an additional tool in the kitchen, you probably wont like it.Another thing that bothered me is the beeping.  It just beeps too much, of course this is because one has to push so many buttons and it beeps with every push.  It beeps when you open the door.  It beeps multiple times when the cooking cycle is done, and again every few minutes if you don't get back to the micro to pull out whatever you stuck in.  There's no option to turn the beeping off.It appears to be a solid micro.  It's a bit louder than my last one, but not so much that you can't keep talking over it.  It's also a little smaller than I expected, didn't fit my favorite large coffee mug, but that's my fault for not reading the dimensions carefully, and that's not a deal breaker, if that had been the only issue, I would have just lived with it, but on top of everything else, I decided to return this microwave after a few days, it just didn't work in my kitchen in the way I need this tool to work with my method of cooking."
5,Use it just for warming up food.
5,"In the middle of construction, needed a small microwave. This one fits the bill. It works fine."
3,"Too noisy, creates a lot of steam even when food is covered you have to be careful when opening door. LED functionality could be a lot better."
3,Good for small spaces but weak power
2,How would you like your enamel interior especially when it begins to rust.  Any liquid heated will leave some vapor.  Not long before you have rust under the enamel.  Should the rust create a hole you have radiation seeping out.  Makes me wary of the manufacturer and the seller.
3,Does a good job albeit noisy.
5,"I got this item to replace my 10-year-old microwave.  My old microwave doesn't even turn anymore. It still works, but sometimes you have to let things go!  This is a great item. After 10 years of the one I have, never knew there were new things in a microwave!  I thought most people just use it to make popcorn or to warm up things, but this one actually makes me want to experiment on doing some new things.  It even has a crisper function!  WOW!!  Great product!"
3,Very easy to use.Lots of power.The turntable is very noisy.  I have tried cleaning every piece well to no avail.  It makes a grinding noise.  Too new to already be so noisy!
4,"Easy to unpack and setup. Haven’t used yet, but hopefully it will work fine."
1,The microwave suddenly stop working. It doesn't turn ON.(No power)
2,Much smaller than expected and takes forever to cook anything!!!!  TAKE MY ADDVICE ONLY BUY FOR A SINGLE PERSON APARTMENT OR DORM!!!
3,So far the microwave is working okay. The only problem I had was it there was one little leg bent and I just didn't want to send it back because of that. Had to find a way to prop it up.
2,The volts are to low!  Takes twice or more as long to cook per instructions!  Not worth the money!
3,I like this microwave works fine and looks cool. Only problem is the turntable has to put back in place after every use.
1,"This combo convection microwave is still under warranty but has not worked correctly since we got it.  You can put something in the microwave...but if you leave it in over 5 minutes, the microwave overheats and automatically shuts down.  It won't reset itself and start up again until it has totally cooled down.  I suspect it is a fan issue.  In order to get it fixed, I need to pack it up, mail it back to the manufacturer at my expense, and wait forever until they return it.  If I try to fix it myself, I void the warranty.  If I can't get it fixed locally, I will probably just junk it."
5,"So easy to set up and use. No push button to open, just pull the right side of the door towards you. The manual is clear and full of information. A great buy!"
2,"It's started to malfunction lately. The rotator is sticking as it rotates, which isn't good obviously. Even when it was new, it took considerably longer to cook foods. I'd often just add a minute to every 1 minute 30 seconds, and then it would inconsistently work to microwave. It's not very good in general. I don't know why people put preset buttons on the thing if they don't EVER work. Every single preset was just, an arbitrary amount of time. Like they didn't even bother testing them, they just used some random ass numbers from 1990 or something.I don't see any way to input a direct time in this microwave either. It seems to be a fad where a company only releases convenience buttons. I used the +30 seconds almost all of the time, because there's no way to set an actual cook time with this microwave. If there is, I honestly didn't care enough to learn how, because it wasn't straightforward."
1,Not enough instructions for use in pamphlet
4,"Bought July 2020, it's stopped heating well a couple months ago. Still works, just takes longer to heat. There's 5 of us, 2 teens so it's dog years. Love the Alexa feature."
4,I like the quick 30 second feature.
2,Just be sure you know what you're looking for in a microwave. This is small and relatively weak (terrible at popping corn).
4,"This microwave is very quiet and works quite well. It is a great deal for the price. I wish that you could program it for more than 3 potatoes with the potato button though. It is not as powerful as a larger over the stove type however, it works very well."
4,No issues works good!
2,"The energy saver turns on at random. It's a hassle when it happens because automated tasks like popcorn are affected, the bag will just smolder and burn because it never gets hot enough to pop. Lovely smell that. My question is, why does it have it? If I wanted to save energy then I would have purchased a smaller microwave."
2,I gave this microwave an overall review of 2 stars. I bought this back in February and the item arrived damaged (dented corner) so I asked for a replacement. 4 months later it completely stopped working for some reason. It's great for small places but overall function was not great for me. I was able to get a refund as I have only had this for 4 months.
1,"I think this is the most expensive microwave I have ever purchased and I like it the least. The pictures and descriptions show a very well defined and easy to read keypad. But in reality, it is impossible to read the keypad without shining a flashlight or direct lighting on the keypad. I have enough trouble myself and I can see relatively well but my husband has cataracts and he can’t see it at all. So that means I will have to do the cooking and that is a horrible fate for us both. Glad it is only the microwave. But seriously it is impossible to see what you are doing and the pictures make it look as if the keypad is backlit. Very misleading!!In addition to not knowing what I am doing, Toshiba left the CLEAR button off the keypad entirely. The only way to stop the microwave in the middle of the cook time is to OPEN THE WELL SEALED DOOR. Now I am assuming that the reason for the well sealed door is to prevent the release of potentially harmful microwaves. But when you yank the door open while it is cooking to merely stir the item or stop it from boiling over, I have to believe that it defeats the purpose of the well sealed door and some of those powerful waves will still be bouncing around and will escape.I would expect a lot better from Toshiba. I would not recommend this to anyone!  I am still deciding whether to return it and buy a cheaper brand with better features. I really don’t like this one at all. And since you can’t tell what you are actually getting from Amazon based on the deceptive pictures and descriptions, the replacement will not be from Amazon."
5,They were very happy 😁.No problem with delivery.
5,Best Microwave I have owned. Cook times are great and heat up for food is fast.
2,"I don’t know what you would cook in this other than may be a baked potato. I guess I couldn’t picture how small it would be. Also, slides around on the counter so that you have to hold it when pushing buttons. Returned it."
4,Be aware that this microwave is black with a small amout of trim that is shiny stainless. Also the latch is giving us a little trouble so we'll see if we keep it. It is nice looking and works well so far. I have only had it 2 days. The price was great too!
1,"If need warranty upheld, recommend using and going through Amazon. Take the money and RUN. Buy better item like Toshiba.Used maybe 5min per day for 10mo. Light went out, turn-table just sat, and only clock ran. .OK, got replacement with 2wk warranty in damaged box, believe a return, thus unwilling to accept.  So they did extend warranty for 6mo but loud (probable original return reason) and after 3mo it screamed. A toss out!"
1,We loved the size of this microwave for our family of 5 but it stopped working after less than 2 years and costumer service has been horrible.
3,"Beware those customers that wanted a stainless steel to match their decor,  this one is BLACK with a silver trimer, Disappointed about that.  I haven't used it yet, I will make another review then."
3,Works good so far as a microwave oven but it is only useable for small single serving dishes. It is so light you need something from keeping it sliding around when you open/close the door. Price seems a little high for what you get. Keeping it until I can find something better.
5,"This is a great little microwave and looks cute . I got rid of my old huge, ugly, space consuming microwave and wanted a small one that could fit on my shelf . This did the trick and I am happy not to have my microwave as the focal point of my kitchen anymore."
2,"I had high hopes for this microwave but when I heat up a frozen meal for 3 minutes then another 3 minutes, it powers off on the second stage due to overheating.  I have to unplug the microwave and open up the door to allow it to cool off.  It’s not a wattage issue since that was checked before purchasing.  I’d love my money back but it’s been several months and now I’m stuck"
2,"I loved the microwave, and it was working great....until today..2 months after I bought it. It's turning on, but it isn't heating the food at all."
1,"This is the loudest microwave that we've ever had...so loud, in fact, that it is startling the first time that you hear it.  Unless you want to wake the dead, stay away from this thing!"
5,"Very quiet.  Wattage for me works, might not for others."
5,"We bought this to replace a much more expensive LG microwave that went kaput after two years. What we wanted: Small, quiet, buttons clearly visible without opening the door, not too ugly. This oven fit the bill to a T. The popcorn setting works great - you just have to realize there are different settings for different amounts of popcorn (which is terrific since sometimes I only pop a small amount for myself).Also, it's *tiny*. If you want to fit a big dinner plate in it, it's not for you. If you want to heat drinks and pop popcorn, and you want to fit it into a smallish kitchen on the countertop, it could not be more ideal.Another thing we like: It lets you know it's done with one series of beeps, and doesn't keep harrassing you to get your food out after that. A ver grown up approach."
4,I recommend it if you want a compact microwave that is not powerful.
2,This microwave fit my kitchen style and appeared to be a good value for the money.  I'm single and only use a microwave to melt butter or heat water for tea (I don't cook with a microwave).This worked fine for 13 months but one month after the warrantee expired the keypad died!I would NOT recommend.
1,This product started making a loud mechanical sound just 9 months after purchase. Highly annoying and makes product unusable.
5,Use as microwave or oven or both. Saves space and easy to clean.
5,This has readable simple panel - my old one lasted 20 years.  This one nearly identical.  Easy to use.  Perfect.
2,"UPDATE June 2023: microwave doesn't heat evenly and takes a while for food to get hot. I microwaved a plate of pasta using a paper towel and it took over 3 minutes ro heat all the way through. My wife used a silicone cover when she heated her food and it took almost 5 full minutes. I'll keep it until I see a better make and model on sale.Nice microwave but definitely NOT worth $149 (+tax). I had to replace an old GE that I had for 7 years. I wasn't looking for anything super fancy. But, I saw that this has a ""sensor"" reheat that is supposed to reduce or eliminate all the steam that builds up and also keep your food from exploding and splattering. Well, it does neither (I do cover my food thankfully). There is more steam in this microwave than my old one. Overall, it's a decent microwave but I should have gotten the one that was $70 and not this crap for $149! If you just need or want a good microwave but not all the bells and whistles that you'll most likely never use, get a $69 one and not this. Totally NOT worth the price!!!"
2,the first oven we received did not work and was replaced. Now the second oven has problems with the convection operations. the oven cycles every few seconds. We called the factory and they said it shouldn't do that. So now we are faced with returning it or live with the cycling. we will probably return it for the second replacement.
5,"This Chefman microwave oven is the best I've ever had, it's amazing! It was packaged well and was ready to use out the box. The black color with the stainless steel handle looks super sleek and modern. It goes well in my kitchen matching all my other appliances and decor. It's heavy duty and solid, this microwave is built to last. It fits perfectly on any of my counters and doesn't take up too much space like my last one. The buttons are easy to use and very responsive, the screen is bright and simple to read. The inside is all stainless steel, it's easy to wipe down and keep clean.Now for how this bad boy works! This microwave works so well at cooking your food, frozen or leftover, to perfection. If you need to just heat up your food, this will do it quickly and evenly.  It also has the option to crisp your food as if you were putting it in the oven or air fryer. I've cooked pizza, wings, and chicken nuggets to name a few, and everytime they came out crispy and crunchy. I can't say enough how great this microwave works and makes heating up food easier than ever, plus it actually tastes delicious. It's also super quiet which is nice.Overall I'm very satisfied and would recommend it.  If your looking for a new microwave and want one with more options and that cooks your food better than the basic one, this is it. Worth every dollar and will exceed your expectations!"
1,"After about a year the internal light started flashing on and off. It is enclosed in the wall so you can not get to it. I lived with that issue, since it still worked. Now after the second year it is popping the power strip, so I am getting rid of it.It got such great reviews, but it is very disappointing that it did not work correctly after a year and after two years it is garbage. :("
3,Note: Missing a +30 secs button and speed dial buttons. User must dial in cook time.
2,"The Microwave lets out smoke and it burned my popcorn to a crisp!! AND THE KITCHEN WAS FILLED WITH SMOKE....i NEED TO RETURN IT, BUT I DO NOT HAVE THE BOX... ANY SUGGESTIONS??"
1,This microwave is lightweight. It is low wattage. It will not pop microwave popcorn on the recommended time. I have had it a few months  I'm going to replace it.
4,Ugguyguyguygu
1,"We really wanted a microwave for popping popcorn and some other microwavable dishes.  This model doesn't pop the popcorn entirely or if it does burns it every time no matter what popcorn setting is selected or simply using the clock time function.  Unfortunately, we just were able to use it as we had to wait for the basement to be finished and now the return to sender is unavailable.  I know Panasonic delivers quality products, just not this one.  Maybe it's a lemon microwave?  I'd like to swap it out/recommend a different model."
3,"Warranty went out April 7th, it went out April 15th .. so mad about this my last microwave lasted 5 years"
2,You have to unplug it to get it to reset to another value after using convection. Convection only cooks 10 minutes at a time
5,"This is a real nice space saver and it works great.  Not much power because of its size, but that's o.k.  It's a real nice unit for limited counter space."
5,"So easy to understand.  Has a 30 second button.  Easy to understand how to program functions.  Cooks evenly. Cleans up easy.  My personal favorite, it has a Auto Reheat button.  A little noisier than most microwaves but it was mentoned in the description and it really isn't that loud."
4,"Pretty good microwave. I got it to use with this microwave mount:SPACECARE Double Bracket Alumimum Microwave Oven Wall Mount Shelf With Removable Hook-MSHF004and they work together nicely and look great. It's a little hard to reheat larger portions of foods straight from the refrigerator, you'll probably be microwaving for like 8 minutes with lots of stirring... I figured that'd be the case since it's such a small microwave. The exterior also does get a little warm when microwaving for a while."
1,"When connected to WiFi, the microwave clock auto resets daily. Which is cool...except, it doesn't respect daylight savings time, so in order to fix the clock, you need to reinstall the device from the MSmartHome app (which is a garbage app sitting at 3.5 stars on the Google Play store at the time of this review)."
5,"After days eating from cans, I finally replaced my old micro wave with this new one.  I like everything about it - especially that it works!!!  One feature that I didn't have before, that  I really like is, if you want 1 minute, you press 1, if you want 2 miutes, you press 2, and so on,  This micro wave made me happy and I would reccomend it."
5,"Sometimes I wish the “cord length” could be part of the consumers choice during some part of the buy. Like some other products have a gallery of choices before adding to the shopping cart. Just a thought. Thanks I love it. It’s the perf size to fit my needs! I use it super often so , Thank you!"
1,Bought early because I was moving. When I found out it didn't work it was already passed the return window. Absolute garbage.
1,"I bought this microwave to use at work and would only use it 2-3 times per week, if that, and it completely stopped working after only having it for only 2.5 years. 1 year of those 2.5 years it was never used because I wasn’t at work, due to covid. I should of listened to all the reviews, stating that it just stops working! Such a waste, just to go to a landfill. My parents have had the same microwave for almost 30 years and it still works perfectly, nothing is made to last anymore!"
4,"This is a decent microwave that doesn't take up too much room. It integrated nicely with Alexa. When there's a power outage, it re-establishes the Alexa connection and resets the clock.Speaking of clock...there is one problem with the microwave: when there's a time change, it doesn't recognize it. So when DST ended, it stayed at the original time.To fix it, I set the clock to the correct time. I then removed the microwave from the MSmartHome app, and re-added it. What happens is the microwave resets itself nightly to the time based on the original setting in the app, not based on what happens with the calendar.So twice a year, you'll have to remove the microwave from the app and re-add it. It's a pain but not difficult to do. It shouldn't happen with internet or Alexia integration, but such is life.Edit: There's now a firmware update that supposedly fixes the DST problem. However, the firmware update seems to never finish. Next week is DST, so will see if it worked."
3,Don't really like it but kept it since  it is not often used.
2,This is not a small microwave and not very quiet but works great.  I use it daily but it take up a lot of room in a small galley kitchen.  Very powerful and easy to use
5,I have a very small kitchen and had to get something like this many many years ago to fit the space. The one that I had finally bit the bullet and I was so worried that I was going to have to modify the shelf that I had built to hold this. I was pleasantly surprise that the same model (but upgraded) is still sold.
2,"I would expect this microwave at 16 months old with a 2-person household that doesn't cook, to be problem free.  The turntable has started acting up as if the gears in the reduction motor are getting worn out from bags of popcorn  It starts slow and makes a bumping sound like it's skipping a tooth as it makes revolutions.  I was under the impression Toshiba was a great Japanese company with TAKUMI .I suppose since they have sold 80.1 to the Midea group the Chinese parts have a higher failure rate."
5,"I have been using my Toshiba ML2-EM09PA(BS) microwave oven mainly for cooking hot cereal, melting butter, and reheating food. It took a while to get use to the temperature power settings since my 25-year old microwave was only 500 watts. This microwave definitely cooks and reheats food much faster. My only complaint is some of my dishes I have food in move a little off center when spinning on the turntable."
1,"Six weeks after I purchased the microwave, I was popping a bag of popcorn and the glass tray broke in two. I had only used the microwave about 20 times. Amazon said it was past the 30 day exchange period so I had to contact Panasonic. After about a month of dealing with four different divisions at Panasonic through over a dozen emails, over 20 phone calls and several online chat sessions, they said it wasn't covered under the warranty and that I would have to pay $40 to have it replaced. Will never do business with Panasonic again!!!"
5,"We were looking for an upgrade to our 12 yr old microwave, and this fit the bill. It is bigger (deeper) than our last one, but we can put in the same spot. Noise level is okay, and the functions work as they should. The microwaved food comes out evenly cooked and the feature is similar to what I am used to. The convection only goes to 425F, and takes a surprising amount of time to preheat, but also cooks well. Overall I am pleased after the first few weeks. I hope it lasts as long as my last one!"
1,This is the worst microwave I've ever purchased.  The think doesn't heat up.  What used to take me about 1 to 2 minutes to heat up something now takes me like 5 minutes for the same foods I warm up.  I've had it for less than a year and now the turntable is skipping like it wants to stop turning.  Don't buy this product.
5,"We purchased this to replace a 14 year old much larger capacity microwave.  We have used the unit about a month.Because of shelf size we needed a smaller external size but wanted the power to speed through the cooking and reheating we use the unit for.  This Panasonic fits our needs.  The power is actually higher than our older unit.  The power cord should be long enough for most placements.We were concerned that the interior might be too small but the LxWxH ratio of the interior of this unit is such we have had no difficulties with medium sized dishes or bowls.  However, if you use larger size dishes or bowls you should review the interior dimensions to insure it is large enough for your needs.This unit is slightly noisier than some we have used but certainly not objectionable - just something we noticed at first use then became quickly accustomed to.  The door closes quietly but with a click so you know it is latched shut.  The control panel is mostly intuitive but a few features do require a reading of the manual.Internal cleaning is easy - the same as with most microwaves.  Just wipe it out with a damp cloth and let dry. The external metal finish cleans easily also.  You will notice fingerprint  streaks as with any stainless steel surface but they are easily wiped away.The reheat feature is nice and aids in not burning foods or overcooking them while reheating.  Again, this microwave is strong and will heat items quickly when on high power.All-in-all we are very satisfied.  Lots of power, easy to use and clean, nice mid-size for countertop or open shelf mount.  Has enough features to be helpful but not ""techie"".If this size fits your needs we recommend it as a strong candidate."
4,"Great cooking microwave, my only issue, it's hard finding the buttons. I wish the key pad lit up, or the numbers were much bigger. Overall, cooks evenly."
4,Used for home .  Can’t see what’s cooking because it’s too dark.
1,the plate could not stay in place or spin not good
1,This microwave is so under powered that I have to go more than double most suggested heat times. It makes guessing the appropriate kernel of time impossible. Microwave Poipu suffered time is about 2 minutes. I've done 5 and still only have half a bag of kamala popped. That's just one example.  I HATE this machine. Look for a model with more power.
1,"I have never had a microwave die on me.  We use them like most people.  Consistently but not overuse.  I bought it 1/10/2017 and almost 2 years to the date it is starting to make a LOUD. noise and I don't expect it will be working long.  OR, I will cave in and buy a new one because it's SO loud now.  This had good ratings when I bought it.  I decided to wait to review and I'm glad I did.  I won't buy another one like it."
1,"I have not had any break down problems (yet) as others have had. I bought this to replace a Panasonic microwave that was leaking microwaves. This Farberware machine also leaks microwaves, using the cell phone test. I called Farberware and they said all of the machines are the same.I do not know of a machine that does not leak microwaves now. So, I will live with it and walk out of the room when it is on.Edit/Update:  It broke!  After less than a month of use, it went down to about 50% power. I returned it and got a Panasonic. I will keep my fingers crossed. Maybe all of these microwaves come from the same bad factory. All of the brands seem to be bad now."
3,"This microwave is a good small option for those of us who can't afford a larger one. However, I've used it a dozen times and it fills my house with a burnt plastic smell, and my food tastes and smells like it as well. I don't know if this is dangerous, and I've had an electrician out to check that my wiring is correct on a badly done DIY rental, just in case. It's definitely the microwave. Adds a special flavor to your food, I guess?"
2,This microwave hold’s condensation for whatever reason. Even if it’s no in use it’s just wet in the inside for no reason.
3,"We had a metal mishap with our older Panasonic Microwave [that we loved] and bought the closest replacement [SN-67KS].  The interior light doesn't light up the interior well, and you see the light source in your eye when opening.  Most of in the inside is in shadows because of the placement of the light.  I know this might not be a thing for you, but the one we replaced was well lit and  never any thought about how the light was placed."
3,You would think that anyone producing a microwave oven would know; 1) how to design a keypad and 2) how to write a user manual in English.  Toshiba fails on both counts.  This is a first impression.  Functionally he heats and spins - no issue there - but I'm only into my third day.  But the front display is barely readable keypad - with dark lettering on a dark background - requires a bright light.  Forget trying to hit the right button in a nim morning light.  Turning to the instructions - laughable - must have used a Google translator because you can barely understand what the instructions are saying - how long have they been selling into the US market????
3,We replaced our over the counter microwave as it died after 6 years of use.. we decided to downsize  the microwave  as we don' t need  the big box anymore. The Toshiba is nice looking but it appears to be faulty. Buzzer is very loud and random. The popcorn function worked well for awhile but now it only pops part of a bag.  I hesitate to recommend this product.
1,This is a Easy bake microwave. I wish I would have never brought this baby doll microwave. It should have beef for $20.00
5,Good
5,"This is a fantastic little product.  Some say it is too small but they should have known that when they purchased it, I did.  No false advertising.  It holds a full-size dinner plate, a 2 1/2 quart casserole and pops corn very well.  I had a much larger microwave and I haven't noticed a great difference in heating time."
2,"There are several false claims floating in the Internet that Toshiba microwaves are made in America. This one was made in Guang Dong, China.  I needed to replace  a old faithful Panasonic microwave that would be rated 1200 watts and fit in a horizontal space 21.5 "" wide so I had to settle for this Toshiba model. The previous 1200 watt Panasonic adequately heated 20 ounces of coffee in 1 minute but this Toshiba requires 1.5 minutes to come to the same temperature.  The control panel design is an embarrassment to the art and has a weird glitch in the software at the ""1"" selection when in quick mode; most of the time when I punch 1 for 1 minute it does 1 minute but it erratically does 3 minutes so I now have to pause and monitor that selection  to avoid boil overs or food damage.Update: 1year and 3 months after purchase the magnetron died."
2,"After using this almost five months, this started getting condensation on the inside of the door, not the inside of the door surface, but actually inside the door. Doesn't seem safe.Tried to get Panasonic to honor warranty. After Anthony Bucci in their Claims Department reviewed it with their ""Engineering Department"" (probably one guy), they said that was normal, depending on the food you were cooking and the time you cooked it.So no help for me.I will avoid Panasonic next time."
5,"I LOVE this microwave. It works way better than I expected for the price and the best part is it doubles as a mirror. The only setback is you can't really see the food when it cooks. And if you don't like looking at your reflection, you probably won't like it - but I look good so I love it!"
5,"My Mom wanted a more powerful microwave so I purchased this 1100 watt beauty.  It's a countertop model as Mom is pretty short and did not want an over the range unit. This one had the Alexa integration though we rarely use it.The unit has been extremely reliable and has simple controls making it good for the grandkids too.  The one control item I do not like is the custom cook time.  To access that control, you have to hit the Clock Set twice; not very intuitive.The increased power helps it match most recipe cook times and makes heating and reheating go faster than our prior smaller unit.  The finish is fingerprint resistant stainless steel and fairly easy to clean."
5,"Good product, works well. Size and all are exactly as expected."
2,"Micro works fine for reheating but lacks a lot of features my last micro had (Whirlpool). The ""quick 30""- you still have to use the start button..not on Whirlpool. And you could use that button many times while cooking and it would add another 30 secs. on the Whirlpool... not on this one. You CAN NOT use the timer feature while cooking but you sure could on my Whirlpool--a feature we used all the time. Also, the ""end of cycle"" beeping is too quiet and only beeps 5 times- hard to hear from another room. My Whirlpool beeped loud and repeatedly- which was audible from other rooms. I have no ""connection"" with Whirlpool... just happened to be what I replaced with this one. Needless to say... I would NOT buy this micro again."
5,"I've had this for only about two months. It replaced the almost identical predecessor model  that failed with the so common ""bad door lock"" syndrome. Otherwise, that oven was still working.In my unit, the poorly chosen plastic material for the latch has been replaced by new low friction materials, possibly containing some Teflon. The latch operates with less friction, less door pressure, than the previous unit. This is obviously an attempt to reduce the failure of the part.The interior bulb has been replaced by an LED.Other reviews indicate the difficulty of obtaining service when the unit must be shipped. I live just 20 miles down the expressway from a service center. Otherwise, I would take those bad experiences very seriously.So far, so good. If there is a premature failure, I will report back."
3,"Was a good microwave for one year and three weeks.The best feature (and why I chose this model) is the option to turn off the beep. Now that it's beyond the 1-year warranty, the bottom row of the key pad (7-8-9 keys) no longer function. The no-beep function is controlled by press-hold key 8: so now that these keys don't work, it beeps by default.A quirk (feature or bug, you decide) of this model is that you can only control times in minute intervals (1, 2, 3, ... to 9) intervals, or add 30 seconds. This is mostly functional -  but if you want to heat for less than 30 seconds - you have to stand by to open the door (or overheat...)."
3,"This was a necessity for my new on-campus housing It is exactly that, a basic run of the mill microwave."
1,"Although this microwave is very large & powerful, the power supply has died twice in a little over a year.  The first time was after only 3 months.  I was able to get it repaired under warranty, albeit with some difficulty.  Panasonic's website is out of date for licensed repair facilities.  The second time it died it was no longer under warranty, so I replaced it with a different brand."
1,"We purchased this item in late October, 2022; it was delivered on 10/25/22. We thought it was great until last week, when I opened the door to put a mug of tea in to re-warm, the button to the door latch broke. I heard something on the interior drop; after-ward, when I tried to retrieve my mug, the button to open the door wouldn’t work and there my mug has been sitting. Talking with GE, they will only refund us if we purchase another product of theirs but most of the microwaves have the same type of door opener. So, we seem to be stuck with getting another GE whether or not we want to. Really quite disappointing."
5,We got 2 years out of this microwave. Very happy with how it performed. It was heavily used. Lasted exactly 2 years and 1 day from the date of purchase.
1,Not very effective as an air fryer.  Only lasted 2 years then died for no apparent reason.  Typical planned obsolescence.
5,I got this unit in February 2022 and its still running like new a year and 6 months later. It does what it is intended for and it is very easy to clean and quiet. My last unit from another brand stopped working all of a sudden less than 6 months after purchasing. I'm happy with this microwave and would definitely buy the same or a newer model in the future.
3,"I decided to change brands, I've had Panasonic for the last 20 years, and I see now that that was the wrong thing to do. I had an inverter oven and the inverter went out, so I decided to get one without the inverter. The food cooks very unevenly, so I'm having to turn food over halfway through the cooking. Not only that, but the control panel is horrid. They are not buttons, the panel is flat, but half the time I have to push several times to get the number to come up. The panel is not at all sensitive, quite the opposite, you have to push and push to get it to work. I will never buy another Toshiba microwave, and I will go back to the inverter oven next time."
3,"Heat well, makes a lot of noise."
3,"OMG, it's harder to use than I thought. Don't want to keep the Manuel at the ready for too long. We will see. The button set up is a pain in the butt. DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE. I hate simple things more difficult. You know that saying, ""Keep it simple stupid"".They didn't. But I'm keeping it. I'll get it eventually. Looks as expected. Does not fit the larger dinner plate. Better get those specs. The internal microwave glass plate is 10"". 11""dinner plate will have to be tilted slightly."
5,It is smaller than my last one. Which is what I wanted. It had great reviews so I figured I try it. Works great so far. I recommend this micro wave.
1,"After a few months and well maintained, unit died! Expect extreme condensation and ours had the start of rust!! Avoid! Save your hard earned money and buy a more reliable unit."
1,"Not a good microwave.  After I set it up and plugged it in.  Put a tv dinner in it and it started to smoke.  Thinking maybe something was wrong with the TV dinner, I tried something else and it smoked also."
5,Works great! Heat food fast
5,"I ordered this microwave to replace a 20+ year old Sharp.  The Sharp held up so well that my standards were high for the new one.  I could not find another with all the features as my old Sharp, but that didn't matter, after learning all the features for this new Toshiba, it was clear that the Toshiba compared to the Sharp plus more.  I'm still learning some of the features - as I do not use them often - but everything seems to work so much better.... new technology, go figure~!  Anyway, I ordered this and it got lost somehow in transit.  A few days after I realized it wasn't coming, I contacted Amazon and they sent out a replacement immediately, I got it the very next day!  ~~~ So my review, short as it is, Amazon did a wonderful replacement job and I'm extremely happy with this Toshiba.  It's so much quieter than the Sharp, they were both 1200 watts but it the Toshiba seems to cook the food more thoroughly.  The Sharp was working fine, but a few of the buttons had been used so much that I could not program it anymore.  I did not realize that it was time for the Sharp to go and let a new generation of microwaves into the house.  Very happy and would recommend highly this Toshiba.  It fits nicely on the counter, it's quieter and very easy to do less button-pushing when using it.  Love that, but still getting used to it.  ~ I looked at MWs at the usual places, big box stores, etc. but, again, this was way better than Walmart or Best Buy had to offer, the price was much better also.  Packed perfectly for safe delivery.  Quit looking and get one now!"
1,"The buttons are really poor quality and hard to press. The overall interface is also really bad. the ""ECO"" button is the stop button. Confuses everyone who uses it."
2,"Less than 2 years and it stopped working for no reason. Buttons stopped responding. Door would get jammed and make loud noise when opening. When timer goes off, it doesn't stop when you open the door, a stupid design."
3,"This product arrived on time and works as expected. It did arrive with a rather large dent in the side, not pretty! I planned on using it in a location where the damage would not be easily noticeable and the product does function properly. I would return it, but don't want to go through the hassle. I'm coming to the conclusion that it's much better to purchase certain items directly from a store where to can actually see what you are getting. With Amazon I'm finding many items missing parts or damaged and then needing to return the items or begin corresponding with the seller, which takes time and may cause delays."
3,"The plate and circle inside won't stay in place. It is so lightweight you need two hands to open it, one on the door and one on the top, because it slides. I can't figure out how to do less than 1 minute. My husband can't figurew out how I get it to do 1 minute. Good for a dorm,not my home."
2,"It is probably a great product...but it was HUGE !!!! I had to return it, it wouldn't fit on my kitchen counter"
3,I love the look of it and it works really well. We all have a hard time when pressing the buttons. I feel like I have to keep touching the area and finally it clicks on. I would not purchase again.
3,The media could not be loaded.I needed new microwave but min came damaged. Everything I've ever ordered off Amazon has been great quality and shipping but for first time I'm disappointed 😞.  I use amazon so much cause work schedule it ain't funny. I still love amazon and black and decker merchandise just upset bout microwave. I buy b&d cause I've had same electric tools for 10+ years. For that thank you.
1,"Bad luck without yes from Amazon we loved..tried. Tryed Toshiba which was quite interesting inconsistent..thrilled when we cbought from Amazon which s where we got GE. I guess we didn’t realize it was too,small…still battling Toshiba.. my husband called them and they told us to send it back trying to make it work"
3,To small
5,I'm glad we got this microwave oven.  The wattage makes a huge difference in cooking time and this one we selected is big enough to hold two of the frozen dinners in the cardboard.  The ease of use is good.  Reading the directions made it seem alot harder than it was.  It does make a little noise...I guess most microwaves do.  Its nice and wide and very easy to clean and/or wipe out.
3,"This microwave was a great price as microwaves go.  It works well and going from a 700w to 1200w heating was a breeze.  The reason that I got this particular microwave was  I liked the Smart Alexa feature.  I wanted to be able to speak into my echo dot and get things going.  The first one that I got would pair with anything.  I called  Toshiba and was told it was defective and they'll send another which came the next day.  Packed up the ""older"" one and I set it up the new one it was the same thing.  I FINALLY read the reviews and found this connecting it was a problem.  I like this microwave so I'll keep it but am disappointed that I have not been able to use it for the feature I was excited about.  If there is anyone out there that with an android phone and a dot that did get theirs to work, please contact me."
4,Bought Panasonic from repair shop recommendation.  Unit is NOISEY.  Light is quite dim.  No 1 button operation. Seems arcaic to press 1. 0.  O.  Start.  Old microwave you just pressed 1 and it started
4,Check the size. Powerful for being so small.
5,Beautiful clean design inside and outside  !! Works great with my Alexa and my 11 year old is just amazed by how easily Alexa and the microwave works together .
3,The first one that came was defective. It wouldn’t open at all so they had to give me a new one which has a ringing noise constantly but overall it does work and do the job
5,"I love this thing! We wanted something smaller and more modern and not too pricey. This is perfect for us. I love how sleek it is and honestly it is the quietest microwave I've ever seen! Sometimes I double check just to make sure that it's going lolMy only complaint is that the stainless steel is a bit streaky when I clean it, but I think that could be solved with a different cleaning spray."
2,ALEXA CONNECTION FAILS. The oven has to connect to your Wifi with a clunky app. Then you have to use a separate Alexa skill to enable voice-activated commands. Those all have to sync and get along. They sometimes don't and the troubleshooting is a pita. WORKS INTERMITTENTLY. DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE SPARE TIME TO FUTZ AROUND WITH THIS TO KEEP ITS CONNECTION WORKING.
5,I am very happy with the noise level and the look and the brand
3,"The film over the buttons is bubbling. It does not diminish the functionality obviously, but it’s definitely unattractive. It’d be great if your new microwave could look new for a few years+ but this happened a few months in. The buttons aren’t the easiest to push either. Other than these issues the product works well."
1,"We got the microwave for a guest kitchenette. It’s a big enough but small size. Once we went to use it, the unit ran when plugged in without any heat. Buttons didn’t do anything. I was outside of the Amazon return window so I went to B&D and got a refund, but now have an appliance I need to foot the bill for disposing. They refused to pay for return shipping for their poor product and now I’m losing money on a useless machine"
1,"We have occasionally used this microwave and to our dismay, it gets out of sync all the time. Really a hassle.  Thus the one star rating because we are just outside the return window."
2,"I bought this in November 2019 and it just stopped working, 8/21/2023"
4,Great replacement microwave.
4,"Our microwave just gave us the H98 symbol, which basically means it is fried. It has done a great job, but since we purchased it in 2020 3 years is a really short life span. We use it once or twice a day in our home so it should not have died yet. Not sure what else to get since this is the highest rated microwave."
5,Beautiful design
1,"I purchased this product on November 19/2021. It is now in the trash. My wife told me it was sparking, smoking, and making a loud screeching sound.  Today's date is October 19 th of 2022.Eleven months. Don't know how to give it less than a star rating."
1,"Arrived a day early = excellent!Looks great = nice!This thing is massive in size = great!Plugged it in… no power. Tried several different power outlets (all working to power other appliances), no power… Appears dead on arrival. Have to return it, unfortunately… running out to Home Depot to pick one up because tired of waiting for a microwave. If it were working, it would be a 5 Star microwave."
5,"I've had this (less than a week) but so far the GE 3-in-1 Countertop Microwave Oven has great features.It's Complete With Air Fryer, Broiler & Convection Mode | 1.0 Cubic Feet Capacity, 1,050 Watts | Kitchen Essentials for the Countertop or Dorm Room | Stainless Steel interior. I haven't used the broil or convection cooking methods yet. But, the microwave, air fry, combo settings work great and is very quiet!"
1,"outside top and right side get extremely hot.  I reheated some leftovers for 4 minutes and got very hot with very little use.  dials are also confusing, sorry I bought it, very disappointed"
1,"Don't bother. Issues: (1) LOUD broke on 2nd day and (2) bulky.First, and most importantly, the microwave is either defective or broke on me the second day of use and now I'm either left dealing with a huge headache or loosing $108.00 (purchase + tax). The first day of use, the microwave was fine so I threw out the packaging it was received in. Second day of use, the microwave started to malfunction. Not only did it take longer to heat up the same fluid (cup of coffee) BUT it started making a REALLY LOUD noise. So loud that it woke up my girlfriend one time in the living room. It sound like heavy industrial machinery is on. I might as well warm my coffee up on a backhoe. Now that I have this bulky heavy product what do I package it in to return it? And I have to carry it down 5 flights of stairs. Such a waste and headache to buy anything off of Amazon that is more than 10 pounds. I'm starting to realize that the quality on Amazon is so inconsistent and you're often left with a huge headache when dealing with returns. Maybe I missed it but I couldn't find  a telephone number to call Amazon to speak to a customer service representative to ask questions regarding the return packaging. They have basic instructions but I need more clarification. What a HEADACHE. Just GO TO A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE TO BUY APPLIANCES.Second, although I noted the measurements prior to purchasing the microwave, it just appears larger than it actually is when placed on your counter space. It's bulky. Had the microwave continued to operate normally, the bulkiness wouldn't warrant returning it. But thought I'd mention it anyway. Otherwise, the appearance/design of the microwave is nice."
3,"Only half the huttons work, but othwr than that its perfectly fine"
5,"Bought this Panasonic microwave because the one I had for an eternety finally stopped working, it was a Panasonic also.  This one it's been improved because now it got light inside and also is not the boring white color inside, it is grey and I love it. Also, of course, works great 👍."
1,"I needed a small microwave and wanted one that was reliable--not perfect, just small and reliable. This one started off fine, but after a week, the ""buttons"" (it's really all just one pressure-sensitive pad with different areas for different functions) began to stop working. First it was the ""start"" button, then the various function buttons (defrost, extra 30 seconds, power levels) stopped. Finally, all I could do was use the number buttons, i.e., if I put the item in, closed the door and pressed 1, it would heat on full power for 1 minute, 2 for 2 minutes, etc. I actually thought about keeping the darn thing--after all, 99% of what we cook is exactly that process. But really, a week? I think Black & Decker can do a lot better. Fortunately it was still under warranty and Amazon took it back. BUT I had to pay for the packaging, since I'd tossed the box. IMO, Black & Decker owes me $18."
1,ARRIVED WITH DAMAGE.
1,"the microwave worked fine, was very loud.  it died last week, should last longer than 2 years.  my sharp microwave last 10+ years."
4,"This microwave works well so far.  It is not as strong as my last one so it takes longer to heat stuff up.  I wish the number and buttons were a little larger and easier to push, but would be fine for someone that does not have arthiritis which makes it hard to push the buttons.  I am keeping it and use it every day."
4,Buttons are kind of hard to press but everything else about it works great.
1,All instructions were in microwave. Could not open door. Child lock was on. Looked up on line how to unlock and did not open. A complete waste of my time. Never buy anything big from Amazon again.
5,"I was hesitating to buy a microwave due to limited space in my apartment, but finally broke down when I got tired of waiting hours for meat to defrost. This one is great for limited space use -- small enough to be unobtrusive, but large enough to fit my biggest plates. The set up took no time at all and I thought it was cool that they supplied an extra menu sticker (in French, but I'm Canadian so no big deal there) in case the buttons wear with time. I read some of the comments saying that it started being defected after 3 months so I purchased the extended warranty and will update this review as needed.UPDATE MAY 17 2017We've had this for a while now and it still works fine. Sure it may take a little longer to heat things up than other microwaves, but it's fine. If you're just looking to heat up frozen things/defrost food/melt butter you'll be A-OK with this model!"
5,A good purchase
4,nice
3,"The front scratches and peels off in the first day, by just barely bumping it with a plastic bowl."
4,"Microwave is compact but sturdy, well made. It is working just fine and I'm pleased with it. Settings are easy to read and understand.My only concern is that the turntable has a tendency to unseat itself; must line it up just right to keep it revolving properly. But I'm sure I'll get the knack. Been using it for a few weeks and certainly recommend."
5,We like it. Bakes evenly.
5,Working &My Mother is happy
5,This model has a lot of programmed options.  Nice size...not small and not giant.  1100 watts.  Love it!
4,"This is a powerful microwave.  I run it for about 1/2 - 2/3 the time as my old one to get the same amount of water hot for tea.Like several other buyers, I had to get 2.  The first was a new one (not warehouse deal), and came with the side bashed in (see photo).  The second was in good shape."
1,"We wanted a smaller microwave and this B+D was a disappointment. The turntable was too big for the unit. it's not centered inside so the bowl/plate is spinning lopsided. A standard dinner plate did not fit and would get stuck while the turntable is turning. The buttons also would not all depress. Some did. Some did not. That was the last straw. I can use smaller dishes, but I'm not going to keep a microwave where Some of the buttons don't work."
5,After 6 months the turntable makes a lot of noise like a grinding sound. I believe the motor went bad. I just ordered another on and I hope that Toshiba is proud of their products and that the one I got was a lemon.
5,I Love this microwave! Perfect size for my counter! The one I had was too big I guess! It works great right out of the box! Great price as well! Highly recommended!!
4,"This little microwave is just the right size for any home/apartment/condo or any living unit that has minimal counter space.  If you want to increase your useable counter top space but don't want to give up most of the features of a larger unit, this one is for you"
5,Fine.  Fits well in our small kitchen.
2,"This little microwave does the job, it just takes a long time and is uneven. I can't recommend this unless you are desperate for a microwave and have next to no money. Obviously I've been there."
5,"The size is perfect for my larger plates or casseroles. Only drawback is no preset cook times for 1 minute, 2 minutes etc. There is a 30-second button that you can keep pressing to get up to however many minutes you need. Just thought something this expensive would have the preset cook times preprogrammed. Overall a great microwave. Nice looking and reheating is pretty even."
5,I just love this microwave. it is perfect for my apartment.
4,It's much harder to operate than my last microwave was it has many more options which I'm just beginning to understand and hopefully master them. But overall I'm very happy with it especially the looks.
5,"Arrived and placed at the front door in its own box for the whole world to see -- I missed the ""put in Amazon box"" option.  After I opened it I couldn't close the door, it wouldn't lock.  But I kept trying and finally it worked.  It could've been that it was not level enough for the door to fit/close properly.  And yes, standard dinner plate of 10.5 inches does fit.  Bought it for $59 in Jan 2022.  Can't believe it's over $100 now."
4,"I needed a microwace for my bew apt since it did not come with one.  I got it for a great price and it does exactly what i need it to do and is compact and saves me on counter space.  Some convenient features are missing in comparison to more high end microwaves, like thers no add 30 secs button. But iverall im very satisfied wuth the microwave."
4,Heats well and nice and quite
5,"So far we like everything about this Microwave.... except... on the food settings for types of foods, the menu is not included.  Yes you can keep the manual around to look them up by cross referencing the number against what type of food the number represents.  Its nice to keep a paper document next to something you are likely to have food and fluids around.  (I hope you see my point)  Otherwise a great unit to date."
2,"This is the 2nd time I've purchased this brand of microwave. Quite frankly I like the size & color, however I thought the 1st one went bad!  Condensation in a microwave is normal, however this is ridiculous! It doesn't matter what you cook/heat up, you'll need to wipe down the inside of the over every time to absorb the condensation that is left behind."
4,"This unit replaced a 10-year old LG that began sparking and had to be removed.  While it does a good job (we use it mostly for heating, almost never for cooking, it is missing some features that frankly they should have thought of. To change the power you have to repeatedly hit the power button to count down to the power you want...eight times to get to 20% power. With the LG you hit Power button and then number 2 to get 20%. If you are using the kitchen timer, you can't put something in the microwave and hit the minute button to heat up something that doesn't need a timer setting as we could with the LG. you're locked out of the Microwave until the timer is done.Panasonic has a reputation for making quality products, but frankly they missed the boat on programming features which are common in even older microwaves.  No excuse for that."
5,"We just got our microwave yesterday and it's wonderful. It does run pretty hot compared to our other one, so if you usually use 50 seconds to warm up your coffee you should try 20 seconds first. The door needs only a light touch to close it and so far it's been working like a dream."
2,Don’t waste your money . It takes 4 minutes to heat up a cup of coffee.And after only 2 months of use.. it started to develop mold in the back . You’d be better off spending a little more!
1,I had this microwave for years and then it broke so I bought a new one. I don’t know what the issue is but every time I use it - it gets a so much steam and condensation inside the microwave - which then quickly will mold if you don’t notice it and dry it right away.
3,"This microwave lasted us a year and a half before a spring in the door failed (see attached picture) resulting in the door no longer being closeable. At this price point the manufacturer should not be cheaping out on critical to function parts, and the door design should be redundant to avoid single points of failure. I'm hopeful that I'll be able to repair it with a new spring, but that shouldn't be necessary at this price point after a year and a half of service."
5,"Perfect for a smaller countertop , doesn't take much space. Works like a charm, for the price, I cant complain!"
4,"I needed a new microwave that would fit in a very small kitchen, yet work like a big one. This is great. Heats the food like a 1000 watt. Has very good and easy to use features. The instant 30 second button and the memory button that you can set 3 memory times for whatever time you want. The only thing I don't like is that I can't use the kitchen timer and the oven at the same time. I have never had a microwave work this way, I bought my first one in 1977! If the oven is on, the timer won't set and if the timer is set, the oven will not set. Otherwise it is awesome."
5,That it quit working within 6 months
2,The clock is always wrong. Even if I set it manually it reverts back to an hour later than it should be. I don't know how to fix this. I love the microwave for every other feature but thats a major problem since its a main clock in our kitchen.
2,"I made muffins. Instant mix dorections says 16-18 minutes at 400 degrees on convection. I preheated oven and Convection cooked for a total of 35 minutes. The muffins were cooked but still white - no browning at all.Air Fry French fries and chicken nuggets are limp and whimpy at 25 minutes.Forgetaboutit.The microwave is only 1000 watts. I actually like a not death-ray-level microwave because it does not petrify food before the food is heated through. This model still boils a cup of water in 2 minutes. It has a plethora of Auto-Defrost and Auto Reheat settings that work well. It is a spacious oven and easy to clean. It auto cooks a cup of basmati rice in 8 minutes.I had a Sharp Carousel Convection/Microwave from ~1990 until a year or so ago when blue fire came out of the back of it. Golden crispy skinned chicken, brown crusty bread ... French onion soup with brown and bubbling Gruyère. I really miss the old girl. (sigh)"
2,"Started beeping and wouldn't stop until I unplugged it, after only 3 days of use.  I returned it and purchased a totally different brand, directly from a brick and mortar store."
1,Worked for 4 months then quit. Got ahold of product support and I guess there is not an authorized dealer near me so they escalated my claim and have not heard back from them. Horrible customer support!
3,I like it but very loud when running
5,"I bought this microwave because of the name Farberwaree, it was 1000 Watts, 1.1 cu ft and the red one was reduced to $99.99. However, due to the video of the lady with the one that made all that noise I was prepared to return it . Wow, was I surprised… The red one looks great, works great, and so quiet I had to test it several times to make sure it wasn’t defective. Nope, nothing wrong with it at all and so far I’m truly satisfied with this purchase. :)"
2,Just received the package and opened it to see it damaged. It works but it seems like there’s no policy for claim credit for this case??…
2,"After a year, began to see rust, inside and out.  At a year and a half, it is still actively rusting so I am donating it to charity, if they'll take it. The photo is from after I tried to clean off the rust so you won't see all the rust that was there originally."
4,Works fine and heats food up really fast. After a few months of use the front door latch does not work as good as when it was new. We just have to push on the release a little harder then before. For now it still works
2,"When they assembled this Loud microwave, they didn't line up the buttons. You have to press by the number's or it won't work. Very disappointed 😞"
2,"I have had this microwave for almost 3 years and need to replace. I have read that microwaves are expected to last about 7-8 years(?).  The inside has started peeling/chipping and as a result, rusting. My family has complained that it takes twice as long as other microwaves to heat food (they are comparing it to the onesat their work). Its a bit loud when in use and water tends to build up easily inside , contributing to the rusting going on. I will invest in a better one this time around : /"
4,"Size was right, looks good, and functions well. Only complaints are that it is somewhat difficult to open the door (have to push hard and also hold the microwave from moving) and that it continues to beep (5 times) even if you open the door and quickly remove the food and close the door). Other microwaves stop beeping once the door is opened. Overall, good for the price."
5,I bought this for a friend as a housewarming gift.  He is very pleased with it and its perfect size for a single person and small meals.
1,Died after 11 months of light usage.
3,I don’t like how the door opens. You have to hold the oven in place and push the button otherwise the oven moves around won’t stay wherever you want it. I had a hard time getting the turntable to go in place and stay in place. I’m not particularly pleased with this item
4,"Maybe my old microwave was just very bad, but this microwave cooks in almost half the time I used to cook.I’m not as happy with the air fryer as I was with my old one, it doesn’t seem like enough room with a rack. Maybe I am using it wrong, I don’t know.The controls are a little confusing for me, so I haven’t tried to use the convection oven yet.I do find it difficult to find the button I want in the middle of the night, I do wish they were slightly backlit.This unit seems much more powerful than what I’m used to. I know it can do more than I’m using it for and I may get into the other features later."
2,"This microwave worked well enough for four months.  Then one evening it started as usual but then made sounds like it was going to explode.  There was also a smell of electrical components burning.  We hit the stop button and the unit stopped..  Looking inside, everything appeared normal. After cleaning the interior which was not dirty to begin with, we tried again but it did the same thing as before.  Thus, the unit has become unusable.The unit that this one replaced was an old Kenmore, which lasted for 10 years.As some general observations about this unit: The numbering on the control panel is not easy to read in low light and the unit is louder than its predecessor  when in operation."
3,"For less than $100, this microwave oven exceeded my expectation. The controls are responsive and  very functional, quiet and a perfect size for under the kitchen cupboard  position.  As far as durability is concerned, just bought this few weeks ago and will give it another 6 months for future quality update. But I'll give it the benefit of the doubt for now so I gave it a perfect 5.2nd Update: 11.5 months have now passed, and my unit unfortunately failed on me. The unit started to spark violently while heating up a liquid in a non metallic container. It created a burnt hole on the right side wall plastic coverings or plate. I reported this to Toshiba and since it barely made it to the warranty period of 1 year,  they are willing to refund or replace the unit. This could be a lemon unit."
5,"Easy to use, great performance, perfect small size for warming left overs, heating a cup of water for tea or hot chocolate.  I do not use a microwave to cook,  so I can't comment on that."
4,"So far so good. For the price I wasn't expecting this microwave to have too many bells and whistles and it doesn't. I wish it had a 1 min function so that why I'm only giving it 4 stars. Overall I like the compactness of the appliance because I needed it to fit in a small space. It's is beautiful right out of the box, but it is prone to finger prints. Shipping was fine I recieved it in 2 days. If you're looking for a microwave with a lot of fancy features I don't recommend this, but if you're just looking for something to get the job done that also looks really nice then I don't think you can beat this."
5,Perfect apartment sized fit right on myKitchen shelf which is 14 inches deep.
4,"If you need a monster-sized microwave, this is the one.  It does more than I need it too.  Purchased to replace an earlier model that died from a lightning strike.  Oddly, the fridge that was plugged into the same socket did not have any problems, so that is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  I put this one on a power strip just to be safe, but to be fair, the strike also took out TV sets."
3,"proscheapsmallsilent (no beeping)conssmallmicrowave plate struggles with heavier foodsweak, takes twice as long as a standard microwave"
4,"The microwave works great, looks great, but it has no +30 second option. I'm still happy with my purchase"
2,"I made a quick purchase without enough research because my old microwave broke. This one requires extra keystrokes to set a cooking time. A minor annoyance but one that will occur with every use. It also has an enormous power plug (it is as big as a 220 volt plug), taking up extra space, as well as a much thicker (and stiffer) than usual wire."
1,Interior is so dim you can't see inside this black lined microwave.
4,Awesome 👍
2,"loud annoying,would not buy againgetting louderjunksave your box to return!!!!!"
4,Love the style and color but it’s very loud. It’s really loud at first and then goes down a little bit. We call it the space ship taking off in my house before we hit the start button lol. Works as designed.
1,"This is the third replacement microwave I've purchased for our office. Yes, it is used on a regular basis, but I have NEVER seen a microwave run while the door is open - Each time I've repurchased was for this reason. We have two of them in our office, so the reason I continued to buy this select model was to have matching microwaves, entirely aesthetic. I won't be doing that again.There is no reason that this should be happening under a year's worth of use. Last time I bought was in July of 2019. The microwave hasn't necessarily broken to the point it doesn't run any longer, it's just that it runs while the door is open. Not sure if it's actually 'microwaving' but I sure hope not. That's even more dangerous.Of course, the support period ended in January and it starts this 2 months after."
3,Was just too big.
3,It's ok for now. I knew I wasn't buying anything but a basic microwave. You have to be really careful putting any weight on the front when the door is open because it will tip forward.
3,For the price it works. I only use it sparingly. It takes a little longer cook times for everything but for the price..... it speaks for itself.
1,"How do I make contact for just received microwave oven that has blown five different outlets? VE Panasonic website is not helpful in Amazon support section. There is no place to enter my problem, nor chat with a service person/tech. Panasonic  phone number listed in Amazon Support section does not connect, nor even gets me connected. Power cord has piece of plastic that juts out of grounding prong and has discolored since  plugging into outlets. This was a considerable purchase for me since I am a 68 years old, disabled widower who lives on a fixed income. Will someone please help me? I have been a prime member since 2005 and never have I had to return an item that was defective upon delivery."
1,This microwave didn’t last but 3 months
1,"Got this because our kitchen isn't very big so we figured we could combine the air fryer and the microwave and save some counter space. The air fryer is very sub par. The hallmark of an air fryer is that it makes foods crispy as if they were deep fried. First of all, you have to cook things at least 30% longer than we had to in our air fryer and then even when the item is fully cooked, it's limp and not crispy. This just won't work. Sending it back. Too expensive to not be brilliant."
4,"Unfortunately, the inside rusted. Otherwise, it was a great microwave."
5,"My grandmother is 92 and her microwave was so worn out. Since she's so old, she didn't need a giant microwave so I decided to purchase this one. It was THE PERFECT size for her!! definitely a lot smaller then you typical microwave but it was PERFECT for her and fit in a small space! she loves it and is VERY happy with it! the handle is very convenient too because sometimes those push to open microwaves get sticky or hard to push so another great pro."
2,"Okay, so yes, it is inexpensive, that's why I bought it mainly, but you know the saying, ""you get what you pay for"". It is so difficult to click open. I dread it every single time.Also, ever single time I put a TV type dinner in there and let's say the dinner says ""cook for 2 1/2 minutes"", well, I have to add at least another minute or TWO every single time or it is still cold in some parts. That can be dangerous with foods like chicken.  But it will warm your food and your water for coffee, hit two minutes for coffee. The biggest pain is that button to open it. I have to push sooo hard to get it to snap the door open and the oven slides backwards. I have this thing now where I hold on to the top of the oven while I push the latch button. That makes me say, buy the more expensive one and hope that it is more user friendly. It will be worth it."
1,Stop working in a week
2,"Microwave is extremely small - hard to fit a full size plate in it. Heating was hit or miss, however, the biggest problem was how quickly it broke down. Within a few months, even with regular cleaning, it started to develop chips and bubbles inside the microwave and turned rusty and unusable. Not worth it despite the good price. Pay a little more for something with quality and durability."
2,"This microwave burns food.  I have found that  potatoes, for example, are hard and inedible on the bottom when cooked according to directions.  I've had to adapt recipes and cooking time because of the tendency to cook things too quickly.  I selected it partly because it was a 900 watt power, thinking that would serve well for my needs.  I can continue to use it, but I am constantly aware of needing to check things during cooking.  This evening I was trying one of the microwave baked potatoes and though I turned it once during cooking time, it was still burned on the bottom and there is a lingering smell of burning (but no sign of smoke or actual burning) in the kitchen."
3,"The 1.3 cu ft. version of this microwave oven packs decent power and enough interior cooking space into a package that doesn't have too big of a footprint. That makes it good for countertop use where you don't want to have something too large. It is branded Toshiba but Toshiba's home appliances division was purchased by Midea Group in 2016, so don't let the brand sway you. That being said, it stands fine on its own as a good basic microwave choice. If you just want something that is affordable and does its main job of reheating stuff fine, this unit should be one on your consideration list.PROS:* Affordable pricing* Easy to use* Small footprint with enough interior space* QuietCONS:* Misleading branding (they did buy the brand from Toshiba so they own the right to use it, but don't think you're buying a Toshiba appliance from your experience with Toshiba pre-2016 or with Toshiba's other products)... which makes me less likely to activate Alexa integration since I'm not sure where the data goes or what network security issues I may introduce. A microwave doesn't really need Alexa anyway.* Not very attractive...  it's a little bit on the vulgar side than the svelte, but you're probably not shopping for a statement piece microwave anyway, so it's fine."
4,The first one I bought started making popping noises after the first couple months so past date to return so I called GE.They said it was still under warranty and said to call Amazon and have them pick it up and replace it.The replacement works great (knock on wood lol)There is a real learning curve to using itThe touch pad lettering is so faint it is hard to see. I ended up purchasing a small table lamp and focus the light on the buttons to be able to see them and that works but it is frustrating. That is my main con.Also I find the baked goods do not bake well on the bottoms.My other oven had a bottom and top element so I think that is why this one does not do a good job but the microwave and combi settings work great.It is quiet and nice looking.
1,"I bought this microwave, thinking it was going to last a good day. It didn’t even last a full year. Ended up having to go to Walmart."
5,Great little microwave. We downsized and we're sceptical. Based on reviews we purchased it and have been happy with performance.
2,"It is loud, shows finger prints on the door/stainless and the plates and bowls get hotter than the food you are heating. We had another Panasonic that needed to be replaced because the opening mechanism broke and thought this would be a good replacement. It wasn't."
2,"it is small enough, not as powerful as i hoped.  After 3-4 times weekly use, it broke.  It turns but no long heat up anything.  My older one lasted more than 5 years."
1,This microwave does not work well at all. You must cook longer than stated and I cannot get the crisper to work. Should have bought a cheaper one.
1,"Fine for the first six months. Now, it only operates at about 50% power. You can even hear it powering up and down. The front control panel buttons work erratically. Sometimes everything works while other times only the upper row of buttons work and other times nothing works. The worst is the beeping. Once the timer counts down it won't stop wailing. Hit cancel, open the door, hit some more buttons. Unplugging it is the only way to get it to shut up.EDITED TO ADD: After posting my one star review Black and Decker reached out to me and ultimately issued a refund check for the full amount I paid for the microwave. The microwave is still one star but customer support gets five stars."
1,I returned it. It was broken out of the box.
4,It’s nice and quiet and doesn’t take much space. I switched from 2000 watts to this one 700. Remember it takes much longer to warm up your food and not much space can fit. Maybe small dish is fine. The roller and plate inside is too delicate and flimsy.
1,Wouldn’t be so bad if it just died.  However the innard ( upper right hand interior corner) started sparking and then caught fire.  Good thing I was in the kitchen when this happened.
1,My how far Panasonic has fallen with consumer products.This microwave only lasted almost 3 years.
4,I got this microwave to match my other appliances. I mostly use my microwave for popcorn or reheating food. The popcorn preset was great. It popped almost all the kernels except for 7 of them which is great my current one leaves a lot more un popped kernels. The eco mode setting  is just to turn off the clock and it needs to be reset after each use it. The top of the microwave does get warm. You won’t be able to store things on top of it. It’s a good size as well. It also has a short cord so it will need to be close to an outlet if you don’t want to use an extension cord.
4,"I bought this microwave thinking that the smart features would be nice to have. But after having it for a little over a month, I realize operating a microwave from an app, while cool, I have not used and probably won't ever use. When I want to heat something up, in the time it takes to grab my phone, open the app, look for the function I need, I could have been eating and close to finishing whatever it is I heated up. I love the microwave but I now wish I had bought the Toshiba model without smart technology."
5,"I was looking for a small microwave for a small space. This one is about as cheap a price as you can get. The amazing part is that it's stainless steel at a ""steal"" of a price. Very happy with it thus far!"
5,"We purchased to replace an Emerson we had for about 20 years. This one was very close to the Emerson in specs so we bought it. So far it has worked well with no issues. The operating noise level is less than our previous unit. The door does make a loud noise when closing but not an issue with us. The outer metal case is black where we would have preferred it to be stainless. If you want a no frills microwave, this is a good one."
1,"I ordered this microwave at the start of November. It was supposed to arrive within 2 days. It was almost 3.5 weeks late, past the point of being able to request a refund. I did request the refund, and received said refund about a week ago. I was surprised it showed up. However, its box shows considerable signs of damage and mishandling. The Styrofoam on the inside was completely wrecked. I opened it up and set the microwave up. Put the clock time in. About 30 minutes later the inside light came on and stayed on. Then, the turntable started spinning. I unplugged it and looked online for help. Found none. Attempted to cook something in it anyway, but it won't start by button command. I'll be returning it, and am glad I already received a refund. It may as well be a paperweight. There's also a screw missing from one of the outer side panels, though I don't believe that's the cause of the microwave's faults."
5,I've been using Inverter microwaves but they only last 1~4 years so switched back to normal microwaves.  This one is basic but gets the job done.  I've only owned it for a few months so will update in 2 years.
5,"I replaced a microwave I'd had for twenty years with this GE model. I was looking for one that would be easy for my blind mother to use, but I also wanted to try one with convection and air frying. I was worried that it doesn't have a one minute or reheat button, because my mom really can't handle anything complicated. I usually put a bump sticker on whichever button she needs to use. As it turns out, she had a fall and has been in the hospital anyway, so I haven't had the chance to try it out with her.It heats very well. I have not tried the convection oven, but the air fryer is crazy fast. Once I figured out that I had to click #5 instead of #1 to set the lowest temperature and time, I was fine. I don't eat meat, so I have to be really careful not to burn things like pizza, tofu or vegetables.One thing I'd change is the buttons, either adding backlighting or a raised surface. They're impossible to see if the room is dim."
1,I thought the ratings were high but this is the worst microwave. It doesn’t heat well and definitely not evenly. Very disappointed.
3,"It's OK. Not recommended for homes with children. Here is why not: When you put a cup of water in the oven, once the water is heated and ready to be removed from the oven, the handle of the cup will almost always be facing backwards, towards the back of the oven. Very dangerous to remove a cup of hot water from this oven for children. Quite exasperating, actually. Esp when we know that it would be very easy to always have a cup handle be facing frontwards in the end, with proper engineering. So this is why I only give it three stars.Oh, and the rotating glass platter, it works, but it is wobbly. Another danger for things like bowls and cups full of hot liquid!Oh, and the number buttons do not work that well. The numbers are large enough, but you cant just hit the number. Only the high part of the number buttons will respond. (!) Go figure!One more thing: It takes two hands to open the door of this oven. The door closes so tight, (this may actually be a good thing), that you need one hand to hold back the microwave, and the other hand to yank open the door. (No, I am not making this stuff up.)Other than this, its not a bad little oven for adults (only)."
1,"I received this microwave today and have already started the return process.  I unboxed it, plugged it in and immediately noticed that the door would not close.  The glass on the door was improperly installed and stuck out 3/4"" from the right side.  This made it impossible for the door to close.  This was not something that happened in transit because the glass was fixed in place.  So the manufactured shipped it with a door that wouldn't close.  Amazing."
4,I just use a microwave for heating leftovers and basic things like that. This one performs the functions for a decent price. Nothing fancy.
4,"It works perfectly for what I need, but the instruction booklet is no good! Even called the company to clarify lots of things, even they could figure it out!!I still have to figure out a way to cook my oatmeal without steaming the inside!"
5,As good as new
1,Nice microwave but it was advertised as being able to mount under cabinet but you can not unless you drill holes in top of microwave was afraid to do it. My first microwave had predrilled holes in it.
3,Hard to read display without very bright light near. No light to make display easy to see. Ad on site (ref pic) makes it look different than it actually is. Misleading ad and dissapointing. Will return and choose different brand.
1,I’ve been using mine for approximately 5 months. Started out great but quickly turn sour. Most of the time now it doesn’t cook. It’s almost like it’s on a low power setting but is not. For awhile we were able to unplug it for a few minutes and it would work but even that has now stopped working.  Biggest waste of money!!
1,You are better off buying a standard microwave for $80 rather than this combo. It promises a lot but any feature beyond microwaving - which it does well - is utterly disappointing.It took full 15 mts to melt some cheese on a toast with the grill function.....and you probably will need a couple of days to bake a chicken using convection....Not recommended
2,"The alexa integration is required for some functions to work fully.  For instance for making popcorn, there are only two settings from the keypad for bag size (2.75 &3.2 oz.) that don't cover my 3.0 oz popsecret popcorn.  But with alexa you can choose any size. HOWEVER, I turned off the alexa connection because it wouldn't recognize my time zone and kept resetting the clock to EST. Stupid app.Even worse is that right out of the box this thing has extreme hot spots.  I have thrown away old microwaves that weren't this bad. It is useless for defrosting without cooking and for popcorn unless you like it blackened in mere seconds."
1,I did read the reviews beforehand knowing what I was getting into so I bought the extended warranty through assurion. I figured the looks would be worth it. This got deliver mid august and here we are less than two months into it and the microwave starts to rattle when you are using it. It goes away after about 10 seconds. I'm assuming it will only get worse. I would just recommend getting another microwave from a better company.
4,This is a great little microwave. The only thing we don’t like is that it’s short. It would be perfect if it was 1” taller.
2,"This microwave was fine for about 6 months. Nothing amazing nothing horrible. Now it has begun dying and smells like burnt plastic when it is run (which typically means the wires are going). Super disappointed to have to go get another microwave already, I would expect it to at least last a year from average usage and cleaning."
5,works. lock design is poor (looks easy to break)
5,"I love it! Perfect size, fits right into my bedroom (I am currently disabled, so it’s just what I need).The buttons are easy to read, and on front icons are an additional plus.Thank you!"
4,The unit looks nice on the counter.  I have not use the grill feature as yet and so cannot comment on that.  It performs well cooking with the microwave.  The sound level is not out of what I would consider average for such a unit.  It is hefty enough to remain stationary on the counter when opening and closing the door.A flaw which may be something others might not need is that there is no beep to remind you that there is something cooked in the micro.  It beeps 5 times to tell you that a dish is done and then goes silent.  Other than that - a functional microwave.
3,"I can't believe anyone would design an appliance today and require the operator to press two or three additional buttons for one simple operation.  The only quick start button is the 30 sec. button  All the rest require pushing start as well at a minimum.  For example, heat two minutes = push 2, push 0, push 0, and push start.  The eight year old microwave I replaced had buttons 1 through 6 designed as push and start.  I never dreamed I had to check for quick start features.The box is well designed and the cavity is white and bright and it heats well without scorching."
5,"It was just about 12% bigger than my old one, however the inside was too and that I liked. My kitchen is very small so this took up a lot of space I had to rearrange other stuff to fit it in place. I really like the choice of quick cook buttons and reheating something easy like half a cup of coffee using the 30 second option on the start button. Got quick delivery even with the delays now to rural areas. We pay the price first just to live in peace and quiet and not traffic."
4,Keyboard is not lite. Makes it very difficult to see numbers and the other options. I have to keep a flash light on top.
1,"Item would not work, tried multiple outlets, and it would not turn on"
3,"The user's manual is useless and looks like it was written by a second grader.  For instance, it says to  ""Press Time Cook"", guess what?  There is no ""time cook"" button!  It also never gives you instructions on when or how to use the two racks.  Other piece of information missing is whether or not metal pans can be used in the convection mode.  I could use metal cake pans in my old Panasonic Convection/Microwave oven but it's unclear to me if I can use them in this oven.  When I looked into the FAQs I got mixed messages.  Some folks say it's OK while others say no so... I called customer service.  Big mistake!  The representative was not knowledgeable and could barely speak English.  I'm regretting this purchase already but I threw out the box so I can't return it."
3,It annoys me when the microwave beeps 5 times and it doesn't stop beeping when you open the door. It's just excessive in my opinion.
5,Silence is golden and this microwave is very quiet.
4,Not everyone will have this issue but the buttons that are not raised are very difficult to  see with the black back ground. They really need to be backlit.  It actually does more than I needed in a microwave but the simple tasks of reheating and defrosting work well
5,"The media could not be loaded.Caught it at a great price during Amazon prime week. It is the perfect size for my counter space and goes well with my other stainless steel appliances. Don’t hesitate to buy if you are looking to get one. Good for 1-3 person households , college dorms , apartments , work office space. Easy setup all you have to do is plug it in and place the glass plate and rubber piece in the inside and ready to use."
1,We ordered this microwave specifically because the dimensions shown in the photo. We have a wet bar in our basement and wanted to add a microwave inside the cabinet and only pull it out when company was over meaning it was hidden in the cabinet.  They have the depth and width switched which was a big deal since it had to fit a certain way inside the cabinet. Super disappointed in the inaccuracy of the dimensions for this.
3,"This is a review of the product, not the seller. Manufacturer's Defect or Installation Error.  I received this about an hour ago and during the Air fry function (The first thing I tested) check, the circulation fan is off-center and hits some metal I can't see.  Makes a horribly loud racket.  If you ever put cards on your bicycle as a kid, just imagine that noise, only with metal cards.  Now I wait for the replacement.Update:  New one arrived with shattered glass door.  Hopefully, the third time will be the charm."
5,Works great!!
2,COMFEE' EM720CPL-PMB Countertop Microwave.Odd smell like hot electronics. Didn't go away after two weeks. Turntable noisy sometimes. Will be returning.
5,"It does what microwaves do! I think it could have been a little less money, but I can live with that."
4,just what i bought and what i wanted to buy thank you. good product so far at what i think was a good price overall.
4,"I wanted to share my thoughts on this compact microwave – it's straightforward and easy to use, it gets the job done and it's a basic microwave for daily use."
1,Caught fire when I turned it on for a test nothing inside
3,"This microwave is on the smaller side. It’s decent, but it doesn’t heat the food evenly. One side of the plate will be hot, while the other side will still be cold."
1,"Put up with a terrible interface, learned to regularly lubricate the plastic rollers on the carousel to avoid the loud grinding noise, and now this... stops doing whatever we'd programmed it for (heating for two minutes at 30% power requires 11 touches), and it starts, stops, emits a 5-second beep, then displays 4 zeros and doesn't react to any inputs. Have to unplug the unit to get it to restart. Then re-set the clock,and try again.We've had it a year and 4 months... guess when the warranty ran out?"
5,"Thought I need a larger microwave! Save your counter space & purchase this little wonder. Only 700 watts, but cooks fast & evenly. I like to cook grits , rice & oatmeal in microwave. This does them all and more to perfection!"
5,"I needed a microwave that was powerful, but fit into a very specific sized space. This microwave/air fryer has been amazing! It seems to be very well made and works like a charm! I highly recommend anything made by GE."
5,"Had for 3 weeks, so far no issues. Very straightforward and easy to use. It was a lot more heavier than I expected it to be, so carrying it inside my home was the only difficult part (I am a 5'3"" woman who's not very strong). But terrific quality otherwise."
1,"For those of you looking for inexpensive microwave. Pay attention to the wattage, there is no power on this unit and it takes forever to heat anything up.So I’m going looking at buying another unit, so in the end I will paying more money than if I noticed the wattage and spent a little more. Don’t make the same mistake I made."
1,Stopped working almost exactly 2 years after purchase (after being lightly used mostly for reheating). It replaced a small microwave that was many years old. I do not recommend this microwave.
5,Works great! Large sized can hold casseroles
3,Quite noisy and power output is marginal.
1,Only two years of service…
5,"This is an excellent microwave and I highly recommend it.  The size and wattage is perfect.  This microwave cooks much faster and more throughly than other microwaves.  The large interior capacity is great, yet the footprint is smaller than you may perceive.  The pictures I've included show the microwave in a standard microwave cabinet.  Additionally, the weight is very light-weight for its size.  Excellent features for various cooking options.  The sensor cooking functions are excellent.  I did find I have to time mini and large bags of popcorn for less time than the popcorn built-in settings but that's not a complaint; simply an indication of how efficient this microwave cooks.  When I went looking for a new microwave to replace my previous 1000W, smaller size unit, I researched information on various microwaves and determined this was the preferred unit.  After using it, I have confirmed my research to be correct; therefore my high recommendation for the microwave.  I've had this microwave for two months and assume it'll continue to meet my expectations for a long service life."
4,"A little weaker than I would like, but I knew that when I bought it. If you want more power, you'll have to pay more money. It just barely fits a full-sized round plate inside of it. I have a couple of square plates that gets stuck in can't rotate inside of it. Be nice for a little college dorm or something."
5,"This microwave oven is made well, and even though it feels a bit lighter than a similar sized microwave oven, it is very sturdy. The door had no play and closed securely, and does not wobble on a flat countertop. The noise is on the lower side of what I expected, but I've heard quieter ovens too, so this is about in the middle of what you would consider a ""quiet"" oven.  The chimes/beeps are pleasant enough, and the display is easy to read.  The stainless steel finish is easy to clean, and the oven cooking features are more than I would use.  I'm a popcorn and reheating kind of guy, and this oven does these tasks with ease.  If this oven should fail prematurely, I'll update my review, but from where I sit now, this oven is an excellent value.Five Star Countertop Microwave Oven"
2,"It takes forever to heat up anything. Light goes on, turntable spins but if something should take 2-4 minutes... expect 15-20 minutes. only gave it two stars bc people like the mirrored look of it."
4,"I like this microwave.  We had difficulty finding one that was big enough, very good reviews and had the features we wanted.  It's bigger than we actually wanted, but nothing else made sense.  It works great, heats well, we like it.  Just a bit too big and one dumb thing.  The button to reset the clock is right above the start button.  ""Really?"", who does that?  One thing it's missing we liked in our prior microwave was a timer to beep one minute later after cooking was done to let us know the ""Let stand one minute"" was up."
5,"Works well and we have been using it endlessly since the day we bought it. We get a new one about every 5 years.The best features are the fact that yo can but wither one large item in or several smaller ones at a time. And, the defrost cycle actually does what it is supposed to."
3,It's been about year. The metal is rusting and the plastic on the panel is coming off. Otherwise its functional.
1,"The item in question arrived with the top back left corner extremely dented. I haven't even bothered turning it on yet, because I am afraid something might happen."
4,"The running sound is quieter with this Toshiba microwave than the last three we have had over the years.  I made a couple notes below.  We are happy with this purchase and the price was fine.PRO:  You don't have to put up with that annoying Wake the Household!!! beeping when it completes its cycle.  Just depress the number 8 until it beeps once before you begin.CON:  We use the Kitchen Timer feature on everything we are doing in the kitchen.  But, you cannot have the timer running and run the microwave at the same time.  Seriously, this is a problem when you need both the microwave and another appliance when cooking."
3,Queria uno pequeño
2,The huge dent on the side was not appreciated.  It would have been too much trouble to return so I kept it since it worked!
3,"The microwave has operated as expected, in that I can warm food and liquids at various levels and for various durations.But I had bought a Smart microwave because I was tired of setting the time after a power outage. I also wanted Wifi vs Bluetooth so even if my phone wasn't close by or connected, the time could be updated once my power -> router -> wifi came back without intervention. Unfortunately, while the time was set when I first setup the App to connect, it didn't adjust for daylight savings, and it hasn't set itself after a storm knocked out my power. I have submitted tech support tickets with no resolution.I use the Google Assistant, and the App that is indicated by the Toshiba (MSmartHome but they have used others) says it supports Google Assistant, but this microwave does not. I am able to use the app to start the microwave remotely, but you would have to put what you want to heat up in the oven, and there is not internal camera or sensor read out, so it's not like you could decide remotely you might need to cook it for more time. I really wanted this to auto set time and it doesn't :<"
3,"Have had many microwaves and for this price, this is nothing special. Very noisy, Seems difficult as it will not perform another action without clearing everything. I find that it was over priced for its function."
5,I purchased this as an open box. It looks brand new and works great. I love that it’s a smart microwave. I haven’t set it to Alexa yet.  Perfect size and it’s quiet. Would recommend
2,"It's cute and small; that's nice.  But I assume I won't need the manual to operate a microwave.To make a bag of popcorn...  Press the wave button twice.  Turn the knob to PL-9.  Press the ""+30Sec."" button.  Turn the knob to 2:00. Then press the ""+30Sec."" button again.Press the ""ECO"" button if you have to turn it off early.If that's intuitive to you, cool - I could recommend it.  I don't use mine all that often & my memory sucks, so I keep the manual on top - until I get around to replacing this microwave."
4,This is the perfect size and is exactly like my last one but with no handle. Instead it has a button release. I'm getting used to it. But I think the missed the mark . None of button's are lit. Only clock.
2,We cannot open the door without golding the Microwave down because the 4 plastic feet cause the Microwave to slide on my tile countertops.  Very dangerous with kids in the house
3,I bought this on the recommendation of SweetHome/ the Wirecutter but I am unhappy with it. Very small. A full size bag of popcorn cannot rotate during heating. Feels cheap. Would not buy again.
5,"Nice, well built microwave. Pricey, but, you really get what you pay for, here. Nice and solid. Doesn't slide all over the place when you just push the buttons like my last one did."
3,"I’ve had this microwave for 5 months now, and quite honestly, I wish I had not bought it. Our last one was a Panasonic, so I thought I would try another.First, the cooking is really uneven. Second, it’s quite annoying when you finish one item and want to put another one in to cook. You have to remember to hit cancel (even though there’s nothing on the timer) to start something again so soon."
1,"I’ve had this for 9 months and it started sparking when I used it.  Mostly on butter or coconut oil, but soon it sparked and smoked on everything and we had to throw it out.  Most expensive microwave I’ve ever bought and lasted the shortest!"
5,"Cooks food evenly, looks nice on my counter, AND has a silent function so I don't have to risk waking my family when I grab my midnight snack! What else can I ask for? Great microwave, highly recommend."
1,"The microwave looks nice, but I hate it. Hard to use-over cooks everything. Makes me sad on a daily basis. I would love to return it and get a refund. It is too powerful. Ruins many food items. I got it almost a year ago but can’t find my receipt.  May I return it? What would be the process? Thank you.  Mary Cate"
5,A no worry microwave that works great.  My last one although worked great started peeling and shedding its lining.  I worried that it might blow  up.
3,The microwave is dark inside unit poor lighting. The outer case vibrates when using microwave. Spend a little more money to upgrade to a better microwave
1,"Received the microwave, set it up, read the instructions and it didn’t work. Took me 10 minutes on the phone with Amazon phone bank in the Philippines to understand what she was saying so I could return it. Read the other reviews. I took and chance and regretted it."
5,Arrived is perfect shape.  Very pleased with unit.
1,"Extremely disappointed in this product and am returning it for a different model.  This unit did not cook evenly and as an example - when  microwaving popcorn with 2 consecutive bags, the first one partially cooked with many kernels un-popped.  The second back only popped about half of the kernels.  With previous microwaves I have always been able to set the time for 5 or 6 minutes and then cook one bag completely followed by popping the second back completely by just putting it in the unit and hitting the start button.  I would not recommend this Farberware 1.1 Cu Ft Stainless Steele Countertop Microwave Oven."
3,Poor ventilation. No serious problem but after warming up food you will see condensation inside the entire microwave. And as you can imagine over time it begins to smell. That is my only issue with this microwave. It doesn’t properly ventilate and all the moisture stays trapped inside thus making it smell. I even leave it open after use to let it air out. But that hasn’t helped. If you are a clean freak you may want to pass.
2,"Cannot completely rate this microwave because I never plugged it in.  I was about to do so but I took my frozen meal from the freezer, read the instructions which said it could not be cooked in a microwave that was under 1,000 watts as the food might not get fully cooked, and knew I had to send the microwave back.  I use a lot of frozen foods and wish to continue to do so.  I will have to get a 1,000 watt microwave to be on the safe side."
1,"This microwave is made cheap, and I regret my purchase.  Half of the plate will still be cold after two minutes.  I essentially bought a piece of junk that need’s upgraded with a microwave that actually works."
5,"Great product for the money, looks great on counter,easy to clean."
3,It was fine until it stopped working few days ago. The light inside flickered for bit before it gave out completely.
4,GREAT MICROWAVE HEATS FAST AND HOT. 1000 WATTS. COLOR IS BEAUTIFUL MATCHES OTHER COLORS IN MY KITCHEN. THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS IT IS JUST A BIT LOUD AT TIMES WHEN IN USE...
2,Has an odor to it. Not sure how many times I’m supposed to clean this out before use but you’d think 5 would be enough!
5,Great product great price. Love it
3,"Although there is much to like about this microwave, like the high wattage for its size, the larger rotating glass dish, and the oven capacity, the noise level is way too high. I can't remember ever having a louder microwave, including the countertop and over-the-range models I've owned. I maybe would have changed my mind about purchasing it if I had known."
1,"Worked well for a little over a year, then out of nowhere started smoking and sparking, and died."
1,"Plugged it in and turned it on and it immediately started buzzing, sparking and smoking! So I put it right back in the box and sent it back. I think I'll go ahead and spend a little more for something more likely to work."
4,"Overall, this works great.  Its easy to use.  When heating up food, its not too noisy.  However, the beep when its done isn't loud and its easy to miss."
2,UNIT DELIVERED WITH DENTS SEE ATTACHED PICTURES .
2,"It looks great, but it vibrates and rattles! I didn't want to deal with boxing and returning so I thought Id attempt to 'tighten'. Well, the tool needed is not included, nor a tool typically found in ones toolbox. So, I couldnt go that route. Tried tightening every other screw I could find. Sounded better for a day or two. Then rattling again. Almost like it's gonna BLOW! Decided to try tightening from inside and the little silver plate inside cracked in half when I carefully released it from the holding notches/grooves. Needless to say, I've decided to break down, pack it up and try again. Thinking MAYBE I just got a loose one and another would be more sturdy. LOL...of course the 'Return Window' closed about a week ago! Stuck with a metal rattle I guess. Very frustrating"
1,"The microwave is a little under 3 years old and it just started sparking and flaming inside when heating benign things like butter or a scone.  Needless to say I will be replacing it.  Scary, I’ve never had a microwave do this before."
1,"Bought this with the intention of having my blind father use. The company app works fine with the microbe from my phone. But the Alexa integration is nonfunctional. Followed the directions and added the skill to the app and Alexa discovered the device. But once you try to get Alexa to control it is cannot find the device. So I’m returning the microwave on this issue alone.But the second issue is how you put time into the microwave. If you want to do an even 3 minutes, it works fine, but to do something at a fraction time, you have to hit the set time button twice, if you don’t hit it twice, you will constantly change the clock time. Which is just terrible interface design."
5,"I don't understand other people's complaints (maybe they got lemons). The beep is of normal volume and is quite fine. It does take a while to heat things up but it is a small, low wattage microwave, so that is to be expected. The only thing that keeps throwing me off is that the cancel button is called ""reset,"" but that has no impact whatever so ever. Great for the money!"
1,This microwave arrived in perfect condition. All of the functions appear to work perfectly but it does not cook. I tried all settings and power levels and my soup is as cold as it was when i took it out of the refrigerator.
4,High quality microwave for a budget price
3,"This is the nicest microwave I have ever purchased.  I don't know what the sensors are doing, but it doesn't heat up very well at all along with being noisy it was a bad buy for me. It's nothing like the advertisement that I saw but I realized I couldn't send it back when I tore up the box, so I'm stuck with it, but I would never buy another Toshiba."
3,I ordered this microwave which I liked but couldn't set clock called customer support and they said it was disfuctional so I returned it getting another one of the same model and it also was no good had to return both... 😬
5,"Love the ability to air fry, microwave and broil  haven’t tried baking with the convection bake yet. Read reviews that it is hard to read the buttons so was a little leery but as long as there is light you can see them fine. And I love the size. Fits perfectly with plenty room for airflow in the cubby built into my cabinet"
4,"The media could not be loaded.In general we like the microwave, it's functions and ease of use.But I have the same complaint as a lot of other buyers, it has Hard rubber feet that slide easily on our smooth quarts counter top, and for some reason it does not sit flat on the counter and creaks when you move it or open the door. It actually rocks about an 1/8 -1/4"" from corner to corner.Also not actually a complaint but be aware the stainless steel front is more like a gun metal gray rather than silver stainless.Shipping was very fast!  Only about 5 days from the day I ordered it!"
4,I am quite happy with this microwave oven.  It has just enough settings and is easy to use.The only reason I did not select 5 is because the metal shell on the micro is very thin and easy to compress and I doubt it would keep from denting if anything were dropped by accident.  I have always had to put my microwaves under kitchen cabinets..  Putting even an empty plate on the top of it causes it to cave in a bit.
2,"Not a good microwave, but not bad enough to  return. I only bought it for reheating dishes. But doesnt do that very well. It takes a long time to heat one dinner plate and its very unevenly heated.  Fortunately I rarely use it, so its not too much of a bother."
5,Good quality and color...We love it !
4,Only complaint is that it’s very small
5,Very happy and satisfied with the microwave.
1,"arrived on time, undamaged and seems fine. The microwave worked fine, but when the convection oven was turned on for the first time, a loud grinding sound was heard-it was stopped immediately and instructions were reread to make sure that they had been followed. They had, and when it was turned on again the same loud grinding sound was produced. We boxed it up and shipped it back.I was glad that I kept the box till I turned it on, and that I bought it from Amazon-return and refund were handled promptly. Won't try this again.........."
4,Nice microwave good size easy to use the only negative can not be use for popcorn bags bags to big can not turn so popcorn bags can’t be used.
5,The only dislike it that its small in size. The things I loved on this microwave oven is that it has presets for things we use often such as the beverage warmer and the popcorn setting that doesn't burn either the bagged buttered popcorn or the regular popcorn that can be done in the microwaved glass popper cup.  This microwave was a must have for us after my old over the range microwave stopped working after 10 years of use. Microwave runs quietly and is a great buy for low cost under $200. with shipping and handling included . The inside of microwave has a non-stick coating.  Wipes clean quickly.
4,It is what it was said to be
5,"Small, but not too small. Very easy to use with good control flexibility if you need more than the basics (I don't). Quiet. Reasonably fast. Good value for the price. I'm happy."
2,After only 3 months the button to choose a heat setting doesn't work anymore not sure how I can return this boat anchor. don't buy a Toshiba I'm living proof that it's a bad move
2,We are all pretty familiar with microwaves however this was the loudest microwave I ever heard. So I asked my 2 adult daughters to listen and they both agreed - how obnoxious. Perhaps this model was defective - I returned it and got  a different brand
3,Bought the Amazon used one they offered. It was also dented and the door was bent. The dent did not affect the performance and I straightened out the door so I kept it. Was still cheaper than the new one. So far happy with the way it performs.
5,This cooks more evenly than a standard Microwave and large capacity.
4,the only thing that I dont like is the door sticks when you press the open button.  You have to literally grab the door from the top or bottom and pull gently to open on some occassions
5,"This is slightly bigger than my last microwave, allowing me to cook a lot more stuff in it. It's very sleek and modern, adding a 'new' feeling to my kitchen. It's easy to use and has a variety of pre-set cooking modes!"
3,"Purchased this device to work in my camping trailer, as it was advertized as having a 700W power required.This is not true!It requires over 1000 Watts and cycles on and off, even with the power setting at level 5 so the average is lower but the requirement over taxed my inverter making it unusable in my camper!Don't be fooled by this clame of 700w power requirement.The webpage needs to be fixed!Don't buy it if you want to use it on batteries, or in an RV unless your inverter has a 1500w rating!"
1,It takes almost double the cook time to even get food warm. Uneven warming - it will seem like it finally cooked/warmed my food then you hit very cold spots. I don't have time to heat the food for the time this requires during work. Will be upgrading.
3,"This microwave had to have been dropped.  The wheeled the microwave plate sits on arrived broken, and makes a bad sound when cooking anything!"
2,"We needed a replacement microwave with a decent selection of basic features, small footprint, and good looks. This unit certainly fit the bill and we're actually overall quite satisfied with its performance. Unfortunately, it arrived with moderate denting to the outer housing and it doesn't appear that it was the result of shipping. The box was in pristine condition with no signs that the box was ever damaged. This leads me to believe that the unit was packed damaged rather than flagged and pulled during Quality Assurance. That's concerning. Unlike many people, I tend to overlook most cosmetic flaws because it hate the idea of wasting and entire product because of a few non-operational defects, as is the case with this unit. But if that sort of thing does bother you, be warned that you might find yourself sending this microwave back because someone slacked off at the manufacturing plant."
3,"The media could not be loaded.This worked well for about six months, but is now struggling to spin."
3,"If you love microwave popcorn, look for a bigger microwave.  I have to turn the bag because as the popcorn bag fills with popcorn, the bag stops turning because it’s to big"
5,"Everything works as it should, no problems. If that changes I'll update."
4,The sensor cook control is just numbers and you have to use the instructions are always required to determine what they represent. It would be better if the readout listed the items rather than numbers.  Also controls are difficult to see in low light levels.
5,"This is a great quality microwave and it looks very nice in our family room.  I didn't want a huge bulky unit or a built in unit.  This is light enough to move around as needed in our basement recreation room and has all of the features you need to reheat food, make some popcorn or warm up a frozen treat.  The unit was well packaged, easy to set up and will be easy to clean given the quality of the interior.  This truly has all of the features you are accustomed too in a larger unit and because it is stainless steel it looks very expensive, it is a brand name that I trust and it adds a nice look to our decor.  Very happy to have this great quality microwave!"
3,The keyboard is hard to press.  It is necessary to fix the microwave oven and press the door button.
5,I bought this microwave to replace my old one that stop working. I wanted something more compact that suited my family.
5,Love all the features. Airfryer is excellent feature . Easy to program. Cooks food so well. Will definitely buy one for my mother.
3,"It is really noisy!  I'm going to try setting it on a silicon pad to see if that cuts down on the vibration noise. The cook end buzzer is LOUD also and why 5 beeps?? 2 would be plenty. And why can't you turn that feature off? Annoying. I only heat things up and defrost so It cooks fine for my purposes.  Easy to figure out the controls. The only thing I've noticed is that the powers below 5 don't seem to do anything. So if you want to defrost something slowly, you need at least power level 5. I had a large over the range micro before this one, so this one seems tinny and unsubstantial in comparison. But it does the job and it fits in the spot I need it to fit into. So it's fine. Only had it two weeks so don't know how it will hold up."
3,"The outer case on this microwave vibrates horribly, I am going to find a weight to lay on top of it and see if that will quieten it down.Update: An old 2 1/2 pound barbell weight laying on top of an old potholder centered on top of the microwave worked perfectly. It's a shame that a person has to go to such measures with a brand new microwave."
4,"Overall looks great and works great. However, the plastic handle does feel flimsy, and the somewhat cheap-feeling coating of the buttons concerns me; I think long fingernails kinda mark 'em up."
4,Great microwave heats food very well nice size inside
1,"Update:  it's incapable or unwilling to operate at 100% power.  It automatically drops to supposedly 80% power if set higher.  But it's not even 80%:  I measured the duty cycle at 25 seconds on/9 seconds off, repeating.  I have to suspect that the magnetron is so cheap that it can't handle 100% duty cycle so they programmed it so that it wouldn't try.  How CHEAP can one get?Considering the rated wattage it's rather slow to heat things up.  The instruction manual advises ""may emit unpleasant smells on first usage"" (paraphrasing).  No kidding, horrible smells.  But it's OK, no more than that.  This my 7th personal microwave oven in my lifetime (as opposed to workplace or wherever)."
3,"It would have got more stars if the turntable would stay where it was put and not come off all the time. Any weight needs to go right in the center, otherwise the turntable comes off the wheels. The rest is fine, still good value."
5,"Great size for my small apartment; fits right under my cupboards. Good power and not too loud when I use it, plus the silver, almost chrome like appearance looks really good in my small kitchen and matches well with my other kitchen equipment. Very happy with this purchase!!"
4,"I replaced my (broken) microwave, counter top convection oven, and the air fryer attachment for my instant pot freeing up counter space and I'm quite happy with the result.  I use the microwave setting the most and it's just like a regular microwave.  The air fryer is so much better than the IP version and the convection oven is also great.  The negatives are 1) the off gassing!  It's terrible and after several months I can still smell it (and I'm very sensitive to those things).  I tried the recommended solutions, but nothing really helped but time.  I'd suggest you take it out of the box in your garage or an open space, open the door, and leave it unplugged like that for a period of weeks before actually using it in your house - it's that bad.  Maybe through some charcoal in too.  2) The directions are terrible, but at this point I finally feel confident putting metal into what my mind says is a microwave when I'm using it for convection or air frying.  Sure, it would be nice if I could see the keypad in lower light, but I just put a little sticky flag next to the 30 second key (which is want most of the time) and it helps."
3,"The unit was easy to use and worked well for exactly one year and then started making a very loud vibration noice.  I contacted Toshiba and was advised it was out of warranty and asked for a video of it.  They were not able to accept the video from my iPhone, so there was nothing they could do.  I was very disappointed to think it just went out of warranty and is not heavily used and will not have to be replaced."
2,"It looks nice and is small but the amount of force it takes to open the door is more than it weighs so its not pleasant. I have a baby and kids so it cannot open this microwave while holding a child in the other arm you need both hands to open this small microwave. It takes a lot longer to cook things than my last one and it gets very steamy inside after cooking things for only 1-2 minutes, also constantly whipping finger prints"
4,So far I really like it. It heats and cooks things fast. It's a little bigger than I wanted bc I don't have a lot of counter space. I like the way it looks. Last microwave I had was white first time I've bought a black one in years or brand new. And it says it saves you electricity so that's a plus
2,Cheap. Buy something better
5,Got rid of my big clunky microwave and replaced with this one! What a space saver! Easy to use
4,Bought for my daughter when she moved out. She likes it.
2,"Sometimes appliances get better over time. This microwave is not an example of that. Yes, it does a good job cooking, but the buttons are hard to see without significant light and the button programming is awful. Simple heating requires you to hit a timer and then your time. The number keys are for cooking themes. And good luck if you ever hit one accidentally as there is no cancel button. Big name on the front, garbage programming decisions on the inside."
3,"From the very first use this microwave smokes  even when you use the microwave for normal warming up microwaveable foods, not sure about the airfryer part of it as of yet, so it remains to be seen how it will perform. Just doesn't seem normal with the smoking on the inside!!"
2,"It is very complicated to use. Poor instructions! So, so terribly loud."
4,Love the concept but have been unable to use yet as I need an electrician to add new socket.  Cord is too short to reach plug.
5,Very easy to use / fits well on my limited counter space.
3,First time using it it nuked my little White Castle burgers to hell the box says 2 min for them and there was steam everywhere I thought it was smoke or something idk It didn’t smell like smoke or taste like smoke it was crazy lol maybe 1 minute next time lol im kinda scared cause I only know how to cook using a microwave
2,"Just had a MAJOR issue I self resolved that all owners of this product ""Will"" face  (04/26/2023 -1010am pacific). Micro will work (spin/make noise/light on after 5 minutes and still food was cold)but it will ""NOT"" re~heat/cook product ....I had to unplug microwave for 20 seconds and then plug it back in...Then it was reset then resolved....but...this is a product defect...Repeat..""This product should NEVER act/function this way EVER! Product delivered March 22nd ,2023!"
4,"Practical device. Gets the job done. More suitable for a single person, i.e. college student or bachelor(ette), etc. For family usage you probably want something with more watts."
4,"I have been testing these combo units and so far this one is my favorite. The airfryer still takes ridiculously long (which is how it is for all these microwave/airfryer combo units), but this one is whisper quiet. Seriously... No matter what process you are doing, it is difficult to even remember it is on! It has a learning curve, as they all do, but I am impressed with the overall manufacturing quality of this unit for the price. It doesn't feel or look cheaply made and it ran like a pro while I had it. (I was just hoping the airfryer and convection worked faster.) I still want to test one more that I have had my eye on, but I think this is the one I will be sticking with long term. Fingers crossed they ramp up the technology with the airfrying to get it working as fast as the solo airfry units. I think many of us are waiting for that to happen..."
5,"I really like the durability of the SS inside. Easy to keep clean.  Multi functional microwave, convection and air fry. This frees up so much space on my counter. I previously had a top of the line air fryer that took up a lot of room on counter and was not the quality as this GE Microwave combo. For the price you can’t beat it. I also use it as a toaster."
1,"We bought this microwave in April and were pretty happy with it until this week (Thanksgiving week, of course!) when it stopped working.  It lights up, counts down time, the turntable turns and it mostly doesn't heat at all or occasionally  barely warms something.  I've opened a warranty ticket, but we no longer have the box after all these months and the thought of having to find some way to package it up and send it in, and be microwaveless for a significant period of time is daunting.  Very disappointed.Other than that, we liked it's quiet operation, good size, power was great (when it worked).  Too bad."
3,Its very easy to clean. you cant put like a minute fifteen because of th 123456 are in the bracket. I wasnt aware until i started using it. It does work well. I just dont like that i cant put specific times to cook food.
1,"I purchased this microwave to replace one at work for our small office.  It was delivered on 11/22/2022 and worked great.  Today (02/01/2023) it started making a loud noise and then stopped completely.  Ironically when I checked the return policy, yesterday was the last day to return it.  Go figure!  Worked great while it actually worked but wish it would have worked for more than 2 months."
2,"One of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had.  The tech had no idea what to do and virtually had to look up every instance. When I asked where the reset button was (mentioned in the nline documentation) he had to ""find out"". Of course he couldn't! When I asked to speak to a supervisor, he said there are none and the only way to speak to someone more experienced is to call back."
5,"The .7 fits a large size dinner plate. Don't expect to defrost a Turkey.  The handle is steel and sturdy arms the design is very modern. It works well,  heats fast and even. Perfect for apartment."
3,This microwave is very small and not very powerful. I tried defrosting meat it took 15 minutes for a pound of hamburger and forget making quesadillas in it. I would not purchase this again.
1,"Very poor quality.  This microwave oven took very long time to heat anything.  A cup of water for tea, leftovers, popcorn.  We reached out to Black & Decker and was past 1 year warranty when the device started to run while no buttons were activated, Started to shut down mid cook so you can't use it.  We upgraded to a samsung last night and will not buy black & decker products or appliances from amazon again.  Learn from out mistake!"
4,"Was noisy, but when it quit working, all you heard was a small fan. Stay away from this one, may cause fire."
4,"this is a nice size for countertop, inside will not fit a 9 x 13 pan but will fit a large dinner plate. Its heavy for its size seems well made, all the features you need and I like the 30 sec easy add time feature. also has a button to shut off beeping which can come in handy under lots of situations . It is kinda loud when running and has a little bit of a growling noise but nothing that can't be lived with. all in all seems like a very good value for the price"
4,"My family's microwave broke and I got this one since it was cheap. Though, its been working great for us. My only problem with it is the size. It's pretty small. Though, it takes care of most jobs and works well."
1,"My compliments to Amazon. First of all the fast shipping, second it was the best price compared to several sites I visited. Most of the stores were charging about twenty dollars more. I was sure to check the model # to make an accurate  match. So far everything has been good. Had a difficult time with picture, I am not the best when it comes technology. My old microwave still works but was starting to  rust inside of the oven. This one is sleek and very quiet. I couldn't believe how much more room there was inside because this looks smaller and takes up less room, but the inside is a better design. UPDATE: I loved this for about a year. One day the light started to flicker, at first I thought maybe it was the outlet, but it wasn't. Each time I use it, it is getting worse. I expected it would last a few years, because the one I replaced lasted over fifteen years, and still works. The reason I got a new one was because the old one was starting to get rust spots inside the microwave. Now reading the reviews it seems that others had the same problem."
4,"I love that’s it’s an airfryer and that’s it replacing my ninja. It’s quiet.But tends to get really hot on top. I’m assuming it’s from the heat of the food when airfrying. I’m afraid it make over heat one day and stop working.The yellow sticker removed a whole plastic protective film from the display. You have to remove that film, that’s why the sticker is there. Not only the sticker itself.When I try the convention version, I’ll update review."
2,"So 20 days after buying the microwave stopped heating food evenly. Customer service said to plug in a different outlet, this helped for about a week. Now we are back to having to heat food for 3-5 minutes, stopping in the middle to stir so it hears right. Don’t really feel like returning a heavy microwave. Would not buy again."
2,The microwave I bought from Amazon with a 4 year warranty stopped working right in 2 ways. The power level quit working and the light went out. I contacted the company and they issued me a gift card from Amazon.  I had only had the microwave one month when the first thing happened and a total of 5 months.
5,The only problem I have is it wont brown the toast.
2,The media could not be loaded.Makes load vibrating noise when started
3,"Love its look and size, but 700w isn't fast enough for my family...makes it too slow! If rhis isn't important to you, it's great!"
4,warm up food
4,"I sent this to my son for his new apt. Great size, but there's a pixel unlit on the clock and its quite annoying."
3,Have issue with it turning on n goes off some times in middle of using can be a little scary never leave it an attended
5,"Trabaja perfectamente, calienta muy bien y rápido."
2,"This is what the front looks like, when removed from the box. Box did not appear to be damaged.Very unhappy."
1,We make a lot of microwave popcorn in our house. This microwave advertises it’s for popcorn but it is too small for a standard bag. The bag got stuck instead of rotating and it started to burn and left a small burn mark on the side of the microwave with the first use. Good thing we were standing right by it and stopped it in time! We are returning this microwave. Seems like it would be okay for other things but as expected is less powerful than larger microwaves.
5,It works well for a little setup in my office.
5,"Nice, yet simple...no regrets."
5,"Great 1200 watt microwave for under $200. Good size and super quiet, too!"
5,"Nice size microwave...not small at all in my opinion...great price. My family loves it, and it fits perfectly on my countertop."
1,"This thing blew itself up under normal use circumstances just under having it for 2 years. Loud explosion that blew the door open and destroyed the microwave. Contents inside the microwave were fine. Typical everyday use, then explosion. Nothing inside that was aluminum or metal, no reason for this to happen. Bought Asurion 4 year coverage policy and they wouldn’t cover it  because they called it “physical” damage which is “not covered”.  Do not waste your money on an Asurion policy for coverage.  Do not buy this microwave, it is dangerous."
4,"Here’s a thought- ever realized no two microwaves are EVER the same.. ever?!! Every microwave in any house, hotel, best friends house, room mates, office, etc. is always different from the other..!! I swear no two match.. ha! this is no exception to carry on the crazy conspiracy!Microwave is definitely counter worthy and nicely finished on x3 sides.. (not just the front like many designed to insert!) this has small, sleek footprint.. and useable top space if needed. But, unit will fit inside a standard cut out in prefab. kitchen microwave nook! All over exterior cleans up with damp cloth and spritz of windex.Interior has respectable space for single serving meals and/or reheatable containers.. (not best for larger family) so select unit to meet your needs- a solid for my sons 1st apartment! KEEP manual bc it’s helpful to learn controls and extra tips! Straightforward and easy marked buttons to learn, not overly complex. Just like I said, you’ll need to learn a new keypad as no x2 are ever the same! I love this lets you set up your own memory buttons for single touch use. My son is a compromised adult- and will do most cooking via microwave. Custom presets are PERFECT for his need.. could be helpful for elderly users as well!As for sound: it’s noticeable while running but, nothing loud or out of the norm. Heat distribution seems even + powerful- taking far less time than my x10yr old unit!! Overall unit feels built with integrity- and included extras seem relevant. A solid option to do its job. Hope info can help decision.. stay safe everyone."
3,Didn't receive  instructions
1,"The media could not be loaded.This microwave worked well for a few years, then one day it started doing something strange. I opened the door to grab some food, then realized the microwave had started up when I opened the door. I had just put my arm inside a running microwave!This did not seem safe, and we have kids that use the microwave, so I immediately unplugged it and reached out to the manufacturer. When I was finally able to talk to someone, they were not helpful at all. After I provided model and serial numbers off of the unit, the lady told me it was outside of warranty, and she recommended I take it to an appliance repair shop.I told her it didn't seem safe to have a microwave that turned on when you OPEN the door, and her reply was, ""Why would you stick your hand inside of a running microwave?"""
5,Instructions for connecting to Alexa were not very clear for me.  Might be because I am of a Baby Boomer.  Love to be able to ask Alexa to turn on microwave to heat something while I am doing other things in the kitchen.  WE have enjoyed the size of this one.  Also like the placement of the vent better for our cabinet area.
4,good Product
2,It’s takes longer then my previous microwave too heat my food & I have had it leery then a year a the paint on the inside is coming off.
5,Found it “used” didn’t find a scratch on it and it’s so quiet I love it. Spent a whole day shopping around for a plane big on the counter microwave found it on Amazon got a good deal and I’m happy
5,"This is a great microwave oven.  May not be as quiet as some of the expensive built in types but certainly not noisy.  Only about a fourth of the noise of the previous one I had that only lasted a year before it stopped cooking (brand was ***** Chef).  Great size for countertops or a kitchen stand, signals end of cooking loud enough that you can hear it in another room, very easy control panel (unlike others), and has a large turntable.  The price is surprisingly low for the quality.  Highly recommended!"
4,We bought this particular oven mainly because of its stainless steel interior.  Microwave is advertised as an air fryer. The oven microwaves very well. No complaints there. But the instruction manual makes no mention of air frying. One would think that there would  be at least a couple of recipes also  to get started but none were included. Toshiba must not be very proud of their 'Air Fry' microwave.
3,many reviewers have experienced flickering/ burnout of the led lighting after low useage.  The one blemish on an otherwise very nice microwave.  There are no replacement bulbs that I could find.  Toshiba would rather sell you a new oven than provide a fix.  I wonder how many have been scrapped because of this $4 .00 part.  Fortunatly there is a cheap similar  bulb ( Led Filament Light 1.5w Z187 Microwave Bulb ) available on Amazon which fits like original.  If you are handy it should be doable .
2,"Very loud when started. Also, turntable vibrates and doesn't fit well. Wouldn't buy another one."
2,"This microwave takes 3x as long to heat anything as my old microwave. It creates steam and every time you take something out (no matter what it is), it seems that there is a pool of water in the bottom. It has no interior light and doesn’t have a reminder beep to take food out. I do like that it takes up less counter space but overall not worth it. Spend a few more bucks and get a decent microwave."
4,works great. Takes FOREVER to defrost meat.
3,"The media could not be loaded.I purchased this microwave to replace a smaller one just after Christmas 2020 and before 2021, I noticed peeling and a popping sound. Now it's three months later and it's getting worse! Not made from quality material.  The first time I've ever seen something like this happen. I'm very DISAPPOINTED!"
1,This microwave stopped working after only using it occasionally for 5 months. I am irritated. I had to buy another microwave for my classroom.
5,Purchased this online rather than go to the store.  Delivered right to my door and my handyman put it in for me.  Fit perfectly and works great.  So happy I ordered this thru Amazon....
4,"A litle less powerful  than its big sister, but for its size it does a great job.  It takes a little longer than larger capacity microwaves but this has to  be expected for a smaller unit."
1,"I'm very disappointed in the quality of this microwave. Its noisy and often starts by itself. Its very heavy, but won't stay in one place when you open the door. It heats great, but sounds like it's going to explode!"
2,"I bought this model in 2020 and have very much liked the microwave oven for its size, ease of use, and general functionality. But when gently cleaning it one day about a year ago, a thin plastic cover piece fell off in front of the microwave itself, and broke.Contacting customer support online at the time, I posted a question asking if that was important and if so, if they would supply me with a replacement.They NEVER responded, their customer support # for microwaves NO LONGER EXISTS, and an alleged different support # asked me if I was over 65 Yes, or No. When I pressed 0 it hung up on me--thank goodness!I've happily continued using the appliance ever since the piece fell off back then, but yesterday there was a flash from the microwave that seemed it could cause a fire there...."
1,I opened the box and the door was shattered
1,"Bought this microwave 18 months ago. Just got a code H98 which renders the microwave non-functional.  One of those things were the repair involves high-voltage and not for the average consumer and buying a new unit is cheaper than to have the repair performed.  I would expect the shelf life of a microwave, especially such as this, to be considerably longer."
1,I literally just bought this a month ago and now this thing doesn’t even heat up anymore.  All I’m asking is either for a refund or a replacement… when I first got it it was amazing… but I’m very upset and angry about this…
3,It can barley fit a dinner plate on the inside microwave. Regardless of the small size it's very nice stainless microwave. Very easy to use looks great on the counter top.
5,"This microwave works extremely well and has a couple pitfalls as well.Pros1) Inverter feature does what is promised. The middle/center of any cooked or reheated foods is as hot as the perimeter almost always. I’m especially impressed with ability this has to accomplish this result with frozen foods.2) I rarely if ever overcook or burn popcorn. The popcorn setting works with a sensor and it does a great job.3) Works well for melting items such as butter. It did take a few tries to figure out best way, though. I now know Power Level 2 and 42 seconds melts two tablespoons of butter perfectly. No exploding.4) Reheat sensor works very well. I tend to forget that I have something in Microwave when I’m working on a meal. This reheat sensor saves the day.5) The auto cook feature for heating soups or making baked potatoes is awesome. Sensor works well so items are usually cooked well. Not over or under done.6) inside is very spacious. Rarely do I have a casserole dish that’s too large to allow the turntable to keep spinning.7) inside is relatively easy to clean.  I usually soak some paper towels with dish soap, pop it in the microwave and heat for 30-45 seconds. This really loosens up hard stains. Wipes off easily with this trick.8) The “keep warm” feature is really the bomb! Forget the need for a fancy schmantsy oven warming drawer. This does the trick just fine!9) Defrost feature is excellent with the inverter technology. I find meats don’t start to cook on the edges or leave the center rock solid, as often as I’d have with a standard microwaveCons:1) The auto cook feature relies on 1-14 and unfortunately this requires you to remember what 1 or 3 or 7 does. Unless you post a list in a cabinet door as I finally did that “5” is for potatoes, etc.2) You really need to prepare yourself for the extra heating power this brings. Don’t recommend keeping Tupperware-type lids sealed on bowls, etc when using this microwave. More than once, we have been scared of all our daylights when a lid explodes off a dish. And that can get messy.3) The exterior door could be made of thicker plastic. I find it to be a tad flimsy but not awful or overtly cheap, either.I hope this review is helpful to those making a purchase decision. While I realize this microwave is less than perfect, for the price paid I’m very satisfied. I also wrote this review after owning this for a while, so I could assuredly say this is a reliable machine, at a great value, for what it promises to do!"
3,So loud it sounds like maybe the magnetron is already going out (as in upon arrival). Needed for a temporary situation so it is not worth contacting the manufacturer over but I would suggest to look elsewhere if you need a good microwave that will last a long time. I am not hopeful that this one will hold up.
2,"I ordered this after my microwave died and having a small galley kitchen with little counter space thought it would be nice. Alas, I couldn’t close the door to use it with my dinner plates."
1,"After half year of regular use, the microwave fails to start randomly. Pressing Start and nothing happens. Currently happens multiple times a day. No troubleshooting information available. Disappointed about the quality"
1,"We bought this microwave in summer of 2021 and it’s worked as expected. Winter of 2023, I started microwaving a small microwave safe dish with some food in it and after about ten seconds, the microwave started sparking and smoking. Fortunately we were standing right there and immediately stopped it and unplugged it. I hate to think what might have happened if we hadn’t been standing there. I’m very disappointed that we’ve only had this for a year and a half! Feels like a huge waste of money."
1,"We bought this microwave last year and have always had problems with the moisture collection on the door and bottom of the inside. We clean it out regularly and wipe the moisture out, but tonight we discovered that there were maggots growing on the inside of our microwave. So disgusting, don’t know why this microwave has so many good reviews. Do not buy this."
2,I am changing my review I purchased this back in Oct/Nov 2016 . It worked fine until today! Power source it dead  not the breakers in my house it simply just died. My last microwave I had was from 1989 so needless to say . I would not recommend buying this! Now I have to buy another microwave !
2,"Microwave did okay, but controls were overly complex. Liked the reheat function. However, today, after a little longer than normal session (cooking some squash), the oven became very hot and shut off. Now, the microwave generator doesn't work. Looks like it fried itself. So, we'll try another brand. Very disappointing for that brand name."
4,"Nice microwave however, fingerprints show heavily."
3,"I set it up and put in a bag of popcorn at 3.5 minutes. Walked away to the bathroom.  This popcorn was totally black carbon and my kitchen was filled with heavy smoke when I returned!  I tried to clean the interior with vinegar and water, but there are permanent ""stains"" on the interior and the patch of what looks like cardboard on the interior right side of the oven is cooked to a brown color and cannot be cleaned.  It smokes inside anytime I place anything in there for more than 3 or 4 minutes, so I suspect that ""patch"" that is burned is causing the smoke. I'm wondering if I can somehow replace that piece that burned brown!  carolyn.sumners@gmail.com if you can advise me on my options.  Thanks."
1,"I need a QuickTime button. Something for 30 or 60 seconds to heat a cup of coffee or whatever.Well, it turns out I was wrong. There was a quick button and now I guess I’ll keep it. The thing is is it hidden under the start button in very tiny letters.But it’s a find microwave for the price"
1,Thought I ordered a new product. Received repackaged used item. Overpaid for used product.
2,Used this microwave around once every week for 4 months. Now the microwave constantly trips the breaker and can only turn on for 5 seconds at a time.
5,It is just what I needed.
3,Spend a little more you won’t regret it
5,"This is a great microwave oven.  It heats things much faster than my previous oven.  I only which that the keyboard was backlit, as it is difficult to see when the kitchen is dark."
5,Very happy with this microwave that replaced a 15 year old large Maytag.
5,"Can’t speak to longevity yet but so far am so delighted with this purchase.Small size and multi functions means it fits neatly in my small kitchen (10’4”x7’4”) eliminating the need for other separate countertop appliances.It’s a very quiet machine. The beeps are not overly loud. And the reminder beeps are a great feature for the more forgetful among us.It’s easy to use. The key pad could use more contrasting lettering but in my very well lit kitchen where it sits at eye level on an open shelf it’s not a problem.All of the functions seem to work well. It’s as powerful, if not more so, than the 1100w Panasonic microwave we had. It may be a bit slower than a dedicated air fryer but the multi functionality far outweighs a bit of time for me.It’s sleek and stylish modern look pairs even better than with my new Bosch induction range and Fisher Paykel refrigerator.If it doesn’t last, I will update."
3,"The microwave is not very powerful.  I've found that on items that take about 1:30 minutes in normal microwaves, it takes up to 2-2:30 minutes in this microwave.  Also, a full size bag of popcorn does NOT fit in this microwave.  As the dish turns on the bottom, the edges of the bag hit the sides of the microwave and does not allow the bag to turn and pop evenly, the result is either burnt popcorn or underdone popcorn.  Meh, I wouldn't buy this one again."
5,"Muy contento con esta compra. Muy buen precio, competitivo y por debajo de la oferta en las tiendas al detal. Llegó con dos días en anticipación a su entrega. Operación silenciosa.  ¡EXCELENTE!"
4,シンプルなデザインで良い。音が静かで気に入りました。
5,So far so good.We are a family of 6 so I wanted something big enough for our needs but not taking too much space.  I also wanted a beautiful look to match my kitchen color theme.  So I am pretty satisfy
1,"After a few weeks the microwave started having problems with the touch pad. It either wouldn't  respond  or it would stop. I checked the trouble shooting guide. Unplugging it and plugging it back in again worked at first. Worked fine for a week or two. Then the problem became even more eradicate and more frequent. The last time it ran fine, but it no longer heats anything.I completed a trouble ticket with Farberware a few days ago. I am still waiting for a response other than the auto receipt notification. I am a Longtime repeat customer, and have been a fan of their products up until now. I am very disappointed in this product."
2,"Our old microwave stopped functioning mid-morning and needed something same day delivery. Our older model was fantastic, lasted many years but the same replacement model was not available til later in the week and we couldn't wait that long. I relied on this company reputation for great products but would never buy this brand again-at least in microwaves. It takes much longer to defrost and cook than previous microwave. An item we defrost daily that used to take :45 seconds takes almost two minutes in this and leaves a remaining odor which previous micro didn't. We are stuck with it for now, but as soon as possible will be changing it out for our old brand. Really disappointing."
5,"I love it, it gets good hot"
4,Nice look.
3,"Works great, but noisier than my old one and the control panel doesnt have a light.  I'd still buy again.  :)"
4,"Shipping issue.  I was first sent a cat scratching post instead of the microwave.  Once return and receipt were straightened out, I am pleased with the purchase.  It is simple to use and functional which is what I needed."
2,this microwave is not wat i expected it does not have wrong watts
4,"What can I say, it’s a microwave. I don’t quite understand why people think this new technology is so great. It’s lightweight so I did have to put some padding underneath it to keep from pushing back every time I press the button. It’s a microwave, don’t get too excited."
3,"I purchased this unit which had dimensions compatible with the unit it replaced.  It is well-made and performs its microwave function admirably.  However, I detest the touch controls, cluttered with functions such as popcorn, pizza, etc. that I will never use.  Furthermore, the readability (gray letters on black background) is atrocious."
4,"good for work, great price. Office folks love it."
5,"I selected this Chefman Countertop 900 Watt Microwave to replace a larger microwave that stopped working.  I am very happy with the operation of this microwave.  I was worried that its small size would be difficult to work with, but I have found that it accommodates pretty much everything I was microwaving in my previous microwave but with a much smaller countertop footprint.  I'm happy to have more of my countertop space back.  The microwave operation is also much quieter than my previous microwave.  It's so quite that I thought it wasn't working at first.  It has a very nice feature where you depress a single button for the number of minutes you want to microwave and it automatically starts.  You can also easily add 30 second increments with the touch of a button, too.  I also appreciate that this oven comes with a door handle rather than a push button opening.  The push button door opening on my  last two ovens were hard to clean and constantly needed too much force to open.  The handle is much easier.  This microwave oven is a very good value."
3,"This Black & Decker microwave has been in service for two years.  This is the second microwave that has had a malfunctioning push button latch.  For no apparent reason, the latch begins to ""hang up"" or ""jam"".  There is something wrong with the B&D latch system on their microwaves; otherwise, the appliance is very serviceable.  When you have food in the microwave and you cannot get the door open without using a prying implement to force it open, there is something ""definitely"" wrong with this latch.  This being the second B&D appliance to have a bad latch."
3,"While our old Samsung served us well for 15 years, the need for anew MW was eminent. we chose this because the Panasonic product is rated well and we liked the design.However the functions are quite bothersome. WTH is ""Inverter"" got to do with defrosting, they sure do not explain very well in the manual.  The over-kill options are more bothersome as well. Too many separate functions that make simply heating items a bit like flying a 747. The buttons are much more pressure demanding than our old SamsungFinally, the display screen is quite enigmatic, more questions than explanations. Overall, it heats, but so does less function gifted units that are easier to operate.After only 2 years, it is broken. A loud rattle from within the case is not very comforting and will probably cost more to fix than dispose of and get another. This time maybe Samsung."
4,It's how I wanted. Powerful and small size. The potato setting is not accurate beware when using that specific setting. You might need additional time. And yes it depends the size of the potato but I've tried with only smaller sizes so yes it's not accurate unfortunately.  Other than everything is good so far.
3,"Beware of the More/Less feature.  It does not do what it was intended, at least in my opinion.  I replaced a Kenmore microwave and it allowed the user to add more seconds if you think the item is not hot/cooked enough.  With this microwave, I found out from Panasonic support that the More/Less feature only works with the Sensor Reheat/Sensor Cooking feature, not when you manually put in the minutes.  Additionally, the More/Less feature works PRIOR to hitting the Start button, not while you are cooking/reheating something (which I find to be more logical).  I also found out that when I hit the Sensor Reheat, then Support told me to hit the More or Less button, you only see an up or down arrow in the Display, it does not tell you that it is for an extra 10 seconds or less 10 seconds.  This feature is not intuitive at all.  Thus, the three-star rating.  If I knew this was how it worked, I might have opted for a different model, but More/Less feature to me meant that if you are in the process of heating/cooking something and the timer has already started, you could add more or less time.  This is not the case with their feature."
3,Everytime we cooked popcorn it burned I even tried different cook times and not hit the popcorn button. I returned it without hassle within the 30 days so no complaints
2,"So this review is coming after almost 2 years of ownership.I use the microwave about once a day to heat up coffee or left overs. Its not that powerful so it takes about 2 mins to heat up a cup of coffee and more if you're doing leftovers.Whats not good and the main reason I am posting this review is that the paint or coating on the inside ceiling of the microwave is peeling and falling off.Thankfully I cover my food w a paper towel when heating food up. Im not as thoughtful when heating up liquids. And thats what happened. A piece of the paint or coating got into my coffee.Pics for reference.To be clear, there is no food on the ceiling. That's the breakdown of the covering/paint.I am pretty ocd about cleanliness so its possible the  multi purpose cleaners I use contributed to that. I also use white vinegar. Nevertheless time for a new microwave."
3,"I've had this microwave for about a year and am moderately happy with it.Pluses:- It's quite small, so it fits in a space under the counter that works well in my kitchen. I wasn't able to find many options in this size.- It's a little more attractive than in the picture. It's shiny stainless steel.- The door handle is easy to work with and keep clean.Minuses:- The door is completely opaque, so you can't see what's going on with your food.- There's no ""minute plus"" button, so you have to enter times manually. It's easy (at least for me) to accidentally hit a number twice, so I'll enter 13 minutes instead of 1:30. To change this, you have to stop it and then click on a ""reset"" button that is a little hard to find. There are no big buttons for simple tasks.- The 'popcorn' button does not work well at all. My last microwave would cook bagged popcorn to perfection. I could put it in and walk away and it wouldn't burn. With this one, only about 1/3 of the popcorn will pop with the default setting. Adding time hasn't helped that much either. For some reason the bags will often split before the corn pops.- The rotating dish seems to slip out of its track very easily, causing it to rattle around.General:- It beeps about 5 times when it's done. If you don't open the door, it will beep again after a while. And again, and again. I'm on the fence as to whether or not I like this feature."
3,"This is exactly what I wanted. Well designed front panel, speed options, and smaller than my last giant plus it works great. Would have given it 5 stars, but it is so loud the animals leave the room when it's on. It's louder than my garbage disposal when it starts up. Don't know if it's just the mechanical gear-drive for the rotating plate or what, but I leave the room (if I can) as well. Great unit, but not for people who want to talk while it's on. I'll get used to it eventually. Shipping and service (getting the unit in a timely manner) was very fast and efficient. 5 stars on that.2-month update: 3 stars max for this unit. Still loud, especially at start-up but continues to bump, clang, and thump as it works (noise comes from inside unit). My old unit heated a cold cup of coffee in a minute, this unit (200watt difference) takes 2.5 minutes! I am keeping my old unit and will try to fix it myself. Sure wish the new one worked better because I no longer need the size nor functions etc. of the old unit (my needs now are for melting butter and heating up coffee), love the size."
4,"Everything has been really great about this microwave oven soo far except the touchpad/buttons! Our last microwave had the nice old school buttons (electro-static?) that a slight touch would activate, this thing, well utilizes pressure sensitive (rubber dome type?) and by comparison you have to push quite hard in a small region in order to get response. I will be surprised if this thing last longer than a few years because of it. Secondly, the UX has an annoying quirk, when you punch in a manual duration of time and cook at the end of the time, you need to punch “add time” or “reset” in order to add more time. I don’t understand this logic, the cook cycle has ended, now I have to push another (see above) crappy button in order to add 10 more seconds to cook. I know, first world problems but really is stupid user experience design, adding more clicks/button pushes when there doesn’t need to be."
4,Heats up food pretty fast and love the +30 sec button it auto start when you click it. The space in side can hold a full size plate.
4,"This is a great microwave and convection oven, however, it's not really an air fryer.  It works, and it will cook foods like an air fryer, but it takes much longer.  If you're getting this to replace an older microwave and you don't like heating up your whole house with your oven in the summertime, this is a great machine.  But if you already have an air fryer, don't throw it away, thinking this is going to replace it.  Also, make sure you have enough clearance around the microwave/oven, because it does put out significant heat on the back and sides.  I would plan on space for the machine, plus 5-6 inches on each side and back."
1,"We bought this microwave because of it size and price.OMG, its horrible:  can't see thru window(?)in door; gets fingerprints just looking at it!;beeping is LOUD; slides around on countertop; 'touch' buttons are hard to press;AND WORST OF ALL - will not shut off from cooking (even after pressing stop) if food gets done quicker than expected!!!AND there is no -800 number anywhere and if u ask a question online, u have to pay 4 it!!Insanity.DO NOT BUY RCA MICROWAVES esp this one!!"
2,Three oven was very small much to small for my use .
5,"It sure beats the old one I'd inherited - which was NOT digital!  I love this one ... not only can I soften the butter (because I can do it in increments of 5 seconds), but it won't let me forget I left my cup of re-heated tea in it - it beeps every few minutes to remind me.  I LOVE it!!"
2,I purchased this in Aug of 2022. It has a 1 year warranty and guess what. The turntable motor started making a loud noise. I hardly use it and never put anything heavy in it. Sounds like it isn't going to last much longer. B&D Used to be a name you could trust but like everything else now it's just cheap junk.
1,"First, the initial install went great and the oven and Alexa has been working about a week.  All of the sudden The Alexa commands stopped working.  I would say ""Alexa microwave for 1 minute"" and Alexa would respond ""Hmmmm.  Microwave oven is not responding"".  Yes, it actually says ""Hmmmm"".  I've been working on this for about 4 days and nothing I've tried has helped.  Same stupid error message no matter what I do.  The oven wifi light is on, and the MSmartLife app works great (wireless control of microwave), proving the wifi is connected and working.  The Alexa skill is properly installed, configured and working.  No changes were made when it first stopped working.  I bought this model only because of the Alexa integration so it's a big paperweight now.  If I figure anything out I'll update this review, but otherwise, back it goes.Edit:  So far no progress.  Due to all the posts complaining about the ""not responding"" errors, it seems likely the Toshiba microwave oven Toshiba ""skill"" is broken.  I'm hoping Toshiba can issue a fix but so far no feedback on this.  Given the number of negative reviews (of the Toshiba skill, not the whole microwave) I don't have a lot of hope Toshiba is paying attention.  Do not buy if Alexa is important to you.Edit: After 2-3 weeks, it magically started accepting Alexa commands.  When that happened I decided not to return it.  I have no idea why it started working after so many failed attempts, but I'd bet money it's not anything I did.  Since it's Wifi enabled, it might he phoning home and something got fixed at their end.Edit: After a week of accepting Alexa commands, it just started the same ""not responding"" nonsense again  Nothing changed here so I have no idea why it started working.  I also have no idea what triggers the ""not responding"" but the oven is broken again.  As I've said before, don't buy this if the Alexa integration is important to you.Edit: I've had this microwave for 9 months and Alexa has worked for 80% of that.  But it still stops and starts working for no apparent reason for weeks at a time.  Nothing else has been changed.  The oven is always pingable and the cellphone app always works, indicating a solid network connection.  Only Alexa voice commands to the oven fail. ""Microwave oven is not responding""  All other Alexa devices work perfectly all the time.  If I could give it negative stars I would.Edit: 8/15/2022 After all the initial problems, the microwave and Alexa have been behaving for months and I was pretty happy with it.  Now all the sudden when I say ""Alexa Microwave for two and a half minutes"", Alexa does its usual flashing as it processes the command.  But then Alexa goes dark without doing or saying anything.  Just silence.  For the ultimate in strange behavior, about 1-2 hours later the microwave suddenly starts for no obvious reason, still saying nothing.  It does this even if I've manually used the microwave in the meantime.  By now the microwave is empty with the food long since removed so it's now it's microwaving while empty, which I've read is dangerous for microwave ovens to do.  It's done it about 4 times in the last week, so now I'm scared to use it."
1,"I purchased the microwave in September 2018. The plastic unit at the center of the oven that turns the glass plate melted while I was making pop corn the other day. The oven was on for about 3 minutes. Now there is a little pool of hardened plastic on the floor of the oven.Today I spent around 2 hours on the telephone trying to get a refund. Amazon has the wrong company (Meyer Corporation) listed as the place to return the microwave to. When you call Farberware you get the phone menu from hell that tells you to go to another company. When I called that number I got a recording saying the number is not available from my calling area. I found the web site and called a different number listed there. They told me to go back to Amazon. I called Amazon and they told me to contact Meyer Corp. I called Meyer Corp and was told they do not manufacture Farberware microwaves. Fortunately, the woman there was from accounting and just filling in for someone, so she researched the problem and called me back to tell me I needed to go back to the 2nd company I called. When I got through,  the woman told me I couldn't have a refund, only a new microwave and it would be an 8-10 week wait. I told her their customer service sucks and I gave up. I will never, ever even consider a Farberware product again, not that they care. This was one of the worst customer service experiences I have encountered"
2,Panasonic refused to honor their warranty. 11 months after delivery the microwave Baganda to emit white smoke. It also quit heating.It was returned for service. This was a long and complicated process. It was returned about a month later in worse shape. It heated for 15 seconds then quit. No explanation of what they did to it was provided.
2,"I'm not overly critical, but it's not hard to get a decent cheaper microwave and I feel misled by these great reviews.  First, it really takes about twice as long as my previous microwave to get food warm.  This MAY be because my new apartment has solar power...there's a chance it doesn't get the juice it needs, so take this criticism with that note in mind.  Second, the carousel plate will NOT stay on.  Every time I use the microwave it gets moved somehow and there's all this clunking.  Really not hard to get this mechanism right and this one simply sucks.  Third, not something I looked for so I won't hold it against this model, but there's no ""Add 30 Secs"" quick button.  I didn't realize I'd grown accustomed to the usefulness of that button, so I'd make sure future models have that when I'm shopping again.  Fourth and finally, the display buttons are silver and VERY hard to read.I'll keep this.  It's not the end of the world.  And it does look very stylish.  But little things to think about next time."
1,"Bought the second one 9/21. The clock does not keep time, sometimes keeps a continuous beep, won’t shut off, can’t turn on. This one is a huge lemon."
4,Difficult to activate sensors  when closing  door
2,This type of unit should not be combined
1,Returned
2,"If you reheat left overs for supper, and have more than two items to reheat, you best let it cool for about five minutes or it will quit working till it cools down. I sent it back after two days."
5,Works well for only 700 amps
4,"Noise level excellent. I thought it wasn’t working properly because it was so quiet. I bought this oven to match my all black appliances, however black stainless steel is gray not black. So far, has been a very good microwave."
5,Perfect size for small spaces!
3,"This is a well reviewed microwave all around - so I it is possible that mine was just a dud.  I returned it because it smelled like something was burning when I used it - possibly the plug or wires getting too hot.Additionally, it is very light weight, so it slides around every time you open or close it.  Outside of the defect, it is small and may work for someone with very limited space.  Otherwise I would pass on it and look for a .9cu not this one that is .7"
1,Product has never worked as advertised. Today it completely died. Will never again purchase another Toshiba product.
1,I was at first happy with the purchase with the size and look but it has stopped heating after only less than 2 months. So disappointed. The return window closed in 30 days so I’m stuck.
4,Given a 4 star only because it seems to create a lot of moisture inside so I leave the door open after use. Not worried bought the extended warranty. Bought the 9 cu ft powerful.
2,"Have had this since October.  Cons - the coating that is used for the display over the buttons is now coming off, specifically over certain buttons that are used more frequently, guests in your home will have to ask for instructions to use. You have to press a certain button to enter in the seconds that you want to use, then you enter the seconds, too many buttons.  This is a second microwave in our kitchen because we have different meals going on.  Our other microwave is extremely simple to use so going to the other one took time and no one wants to use it - lolPro - it works"
3,Can't give an in depth review because all I use a microwave for is heating stuff up. It's been a month and it still works. Lol
5,"This is the best microwave I think I have ever owned.  It's not just the variety of the ""quick buttons"" that are so great, but the color is great and I love the strong handle on the door.  This is the quietest one I've ever had - it is really whisper quiet with a good loud 5 beeps when your item is cooked/heated.  It's a bit silly, but the inside of it is the best part because it is a medium gray rather than a glaring off white like most microwaves.  Okay, i've only had it for a few days, but I love it and I don't think I'll ever get another brand.  With the 1100 watts and the 1.3 CF size, it is good for everything!  I highly recommend it!"
1,Microwave controls are in French. It did not come with English key pads cooking instructions. I tried to find a call number to ask for help but it was not included in the packaging.
2,Did not work
4,"I'm one of those who look at a microwave and throw away the instructions. HOWEVER, with this one there is ONE KEY INSTRUCTION that unless you find it, the other tabs won't work.After noodling with it for a few days I located it and everything is fine now.OF course it is only 900 W but does have 10 power levels (although I don't know what would work better than full power).The convenience of the 3 buttons for specific items, like potatoes or popcorn or drinks is helpful.  Other than that it's what I wanted, quick and not too expensive.  (I noticed the price today. I picked up from Amazon for $80.00  when I rechecked the details.  That $120.00 price is a bit much, at least they lowered that to about $93 as I recall)"
3,"This microwave would probably work well if you are worried about tripping a breaker but for normal, household use, buy a different model. 700W is not very powerful. For instance, It took over 8 min to heat up a package of vegetables that steam in a bag (it normally takes 4 min in the larger ones)That being said, it is compact and easy to use. It is clearly marked 700W. If you’re retired (like me) and have extra time to wait for something to heat up, this microwave may be ok for you. If you’re like my wife/kids and impatient, habitually late or in a hurry, you’ll need something with a lot more power (like 1200W)."
5,It is a prefect fit in my kitchen allowing more counter space.  We use is mostly to heat things up and it is fine.
3,"microwave and convection ovens seem to work OK, but while working its very loud.  During a work function if you place your hand on the right side of the oven it quiets the noise and when I moved the unit o place it in a better position on the cabinet shelf it seems to completely erase anything on the screen ( clock or operating time) The first time I used it to cook a meal, I had to reset the clock five times.  It was aggravating."
1,"This microwave has totally stopped working and I bought it new on amazon .total waste of a lot of money.the return and help window closed..sad I feel that with a high name brand company,they should help or replace the microwave. Any advice.? should I report to consumer affairs?"
4,"Received this small counter top microwaveJuly 2, 2022. On Nov 1 it caught on fire. Burned microwave plate and area underneath. Lots of flames. Oven clean. Heard noise, looked and there it was blazing. Pd $111.89 +tax.  Perfect size. Black-Decker very accommodating once I send Amazon receipt.  Haven’t figured out how to do that and can’t reach Amazon for help. Seriously considering going to Walmart and getting a microwave. Looking now for Panasonic. Had 2 in 21 yrs."
4,This microwave is nice BUT it’s way more power than I need.  I had a 750W & this is a 1200W…..big learning curve.  After several hockey-puck trials I’m very stingy with the power levels I use.The thing I like least is I  cannot see inside the microwave while cooking…..the door is too dark.
5,"My previous microwave was also a Panasonic, very similar to this one. It had lasted for many, many years and was still working, but when the price dropped on this one, decided to buy. I noticed that the Sensor Cook items are different for this one. My previous one allowed me to press Sensor Cook and a number. This one requires pressing Sensor a number of times to get to the correct number. Not as convenient, but it works. This microwave appears to cook faster than my previous one, probably because it is slightly higher in wattage.I was surprised to see that one of the Sensor Cook items was an omelette. My first reaction was, who cooks an omelette in the microwave? Then I decided to try it according to the recipe in the manual. Perfect omelettes! I prepare the eggs & milk according to the recipe, place the sprayed plate (spray, not butter) in the microwave, and then add the egg mixture. This method prevents any spillage, which happened to me the first time when I added the eggs before putting the plate in the microwave. Cover the eggs with a round piece of parchment, which is important to make sure the center of the omelette is cooked. (I know from when I forgot.) I pre-cook frozen chopped vegetables in the microwave, and when the omelette is done, add a little shredded cheese to it, perhaps some salsa, and the veggies. Fold it over and it looks beautiful. Also, low calorie! Never thought I would be doing omelettes in the microwave, but this makes perfect omelettes if you follow the directions.I have had the microwave for about a month now and I am very pleased with it.  I’m hoping it lasts as well as my previous one."
4,"Very compact. Read the instructions to get a gist of how it works, takes a minute and you’re ready to nuke."
4,Good price nice looking micro efficient
3,We bought it because it matches the kitchen appliances. But it’s very noisy.
1,This microwave was used 5 times and broke.  It became very quiet and stopped heating the food. It shut down 5 minutes too early of a 7minute regular cook time.  The exterior top right side of outer metal panel became extremely hot as well as the right exterior rear.  Hot enough to cause skin to burn. I tried it multiple times with the same result.  I've had it 2 months and Amazon will not allow me to return it.  I have to drive this microwave to a Panasonic endorsed repair facility over 20 miles away and they are not returning my calls.  Buyer beware ! Do not buy this microwave !!!!  I am one to not give bad reviews but this is really warranted.  Do not buy !
4,Love it
3,I really love this microwave but after only two months the covering over the numbers are coming off. See image. Guess I need to use that warranty.
2,"I bought this brand and model based on a stellar review by Wirecutter. But just after 8 months of use, the interior light flickers badly and sometimes shuts off completely while the unit is cooking. Frustrating. Other buyers have noted the same problem. I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll fix or replace it since it's still under the one-year warranty. Panel is simple enough to use, but the microwave is pretty noisy. I wouldn't buy this product again mainly because the interior light is unreliable."
3,This is not an easy microwave to set up. It does not have a button to push if you just want to reheat a cup of coffee for say 30 seconds. You have to just start it and stand right there until you want it to stop and then you have to manually stop it. I bought it mostly because the size fits on top of my compact refrigerator in my home office and I wanted to be able to heat coffee.
1,"Opened it up plugged it in right out of the box, goes on but doesn't heat anything, impossible to contact the company had to eat the $100 loss, disgusting, this will be you next don't buy !"
4,"Part of the reason I purchased this microwave/convection combo was because it mentioned it had an air fryer function. Although it has a button that says ""Air Fryer,"" the accompanying manual makes ZERO mention of this feature or how to use it. When I cooked Brussels Sprouts with the Air Fryer button, it roasted the veggies and took close to 45 minutes--not the same as a crisp air-fried results in 12 minutes I get with my air fryer. I think this comes pretty close to false advertising. Overall the microwave and convection functions work well, the oven seems well made, and is simple to use, so I still gave it 4 stars. Just don't expect air frying."
3,Good as microwave oven but takes forever as air fryer or convection.
4,It’s 4 stars because there’s very LITTLE instruction for use.  I’ve never used convection and don’t how/ times/etc.  I also don’t understand times etc for air fry function. I think it’s possible to go to website to search info but I’m busy still building! Would be nice to have instructions with product for daily use..
4,I'm very pleased with this microwave. Wanted to replace a big bulky microwave that I had for 20 yrs. This microwave is sleek looking and quiet. Takes up less space than my previous microwave.
1,"Just purchased on July,  I does not work.. smoke came  out.  so dangerous"
1,"I purchased the microwave in December and when it came, the microwave was unlevel. I opened a ticket with Toshiba the day I received the microwave. They have not been able to send me parts as of February. Dealing with their customer services has been frustrating. It shouldn't be hard to have 4 plastic level feet shipped. I have had 4 calls and 3 emails exchanges and still no resolution. I have ""fixed"" the issue with an Apple watch band acting as a shim. Bottom line, don't expect Toshiba to stand by their products without dealing with a major ordeal."
1,"The size was perfect for my small counter, and though it's not at all powerful, it did it's job just fine, until it caught fire.  I'm diligent about keeping my microwave clean, and hadn't used it with any sort of metal (of course).  I was microwaving a glass container of water when it began sparking, then caught fire.  Luckily, I was in the kitchen and immediately unplugged the unit, so it didn't cause any damage.  Obviously, this unit is done for, which is disappointing after about 15 months of careful use."
4,"Not made as well I think it should  be , Poor door setup Dont think ill buy one again"
5,My grandmothers microwave broke down and this is almost identical to it. She was able to use it without any issues.
2,We returned it due to the loud hum we often heard when using it. We were legitimately concerned for our safety.
5,like the fact we got it brand new and it was well worth it
2,"We were very happy with this microwave for the last 2 years & 3 months. Then the turntable stopped turning. We contacted Panasonic & they sent a useless email saying we should make sure the turntable is seated properly. Duh! We cannot find anyone to fix it & it is out of warranty. But a microwave should last more than 2 years, right? Our last one was around, working fine, for 7 years & my mom's is 15 years old! We'll take this one to the ""special"" semiannual recycling collection, but you know most of it will end up in a landfill somewhere. Very happy -- then very disappointed."
5,This microwave evenly cooks and heats up items.  I like it a lot and recommend it.
5,Easy to use. I like the lightning. Cooks fast & great for defrosting. Happy me!
3,Heat food
5,Like it's looks and funtions well.Cons: the DELIVERY!!!!!THIS ITEM WEIGHS ALMOST 30 LBS. and I said to put it on front of my door.THEY LEFT IT IN THE MAILROOM I HAD TO CARRY IT UP TO MY 6TH FL. APT!!!I only weigh 110 lbs and this thing weighs 1/3 my weight! The delivery was irresponsible  and horrid!!!!
3,"TO BE FAIR AFTER 3 YEARS, STILL WORKING OK.  Yes, the comments on quality are correct, but for the price is fair, but should not be ""AMAZON CHOICE"" since other newer models with better build are available now for similar price.PLASTIC OVER BUTTONS  does wear off after a few months, but still function.For a ""cheap"", simple microwave it is acceptable. Chinese mass market (branded Farberware, imported by Edge Consumer Brands).CONS FIRST: Overall flimsy build. Door, metal, turntable ring, control panel all the basics. Would not expect to last very long with frequent use. Much louder than any others I've owned or used - but bearable. Light is so dim and with dark interior it does not allow user to see through front glass and barely see even when opened. Control panel is not back-lit, so need a bright area to see keys. Door latch is flimsy plastic;, so would not expect it to last very long (even has ""grease"" put on bottom of hooks to open smoother).  Also very short power cord so must be withing 30 inches of power outlet or add a good extension cord.PROS: Clean, attractive style, but only ""trim"" stainless strips. Average dimensions, so fits well on most counters. Interior is full 1.1 Cu. Ft. so fairly large plates and pots fit fine - but don't expect larger platters or tall items to fit.OVERALL: Average/acceptable basic microwave for light use and simple cooking functions. Be advised that light is useless, can not see through front window, very loud operation, flimsy door and overall build. But for an inexpensive unit is does the job. Time will tell for durability."
5,This the best microwave I have bought in a long time. It is well worth the money I spent for it. It heats everything really well. it is fast an evenly cooks everything I had a 700 watt 1 that I had to set the time on an double it an it did not cook as well as this one . I have read the other reviews on this oven an have not had any of the problems they mentioned so I can only assume that they got a lemon or did not keep it far enough from other things so that it has proper ventilation. I would highly recommend this microwave if you are needing one an are on a tight budget like me.
1,This product last 13 months and than started arking and catching fire. Customer service was unreachable. I would not recommend nor do I intend to purchase this product ever again. This is a throw away product.
4,"This is a nice microwave, perfect for our needs, and the look we could not find anywhere else. white and stainless.Upon arrival,  the box was undamaged, and the unit was packed well for shipping.  Unfortunately, when I tested its operation with a mug of water, I noticed a groaning noise in the back of the unit.  The fan that cools the unit was not turning.  Fortunately, I repair appliances for a living and was able to find a new fan at my shop. and installed it in 10 minutes.  Hopefully this does not happen to you, but if it does, don't panic, it is just the way things are now.  Manufacturers know it and will make it right."
5,I bought this for my sister in Colorado who lives in a small apartment. She was in the hospital for two months before she got to use it. It was perfect for her small space and she really loves the silver color. I usually buy this brand.
3,"1. the thermostat is way off.  get a good separate thermometer and use it to calibrate what you will have to do to get to the desired temperature.  it does hold a steady temperature once set.2. it takes a LONG time to heat up, even in broil mode.3.  the instruction manual is very good.  read it.4. the pans that come w/ it are very nice.5. the down-folding door is less convenient than one that would swing to the side."
2,"Too light weight and poorly made. On arrival, the lower metal piece on the door was pushed away from the glass door. It’s nice and big but a poor display of Toshiba’s usual superior craftsmanship."
1,I ordered this item and it did not work so I returned the item for the same exact item and when I received it the second microwave  didn't work either.  I was charged $41.99 for the item but after returning it my refund was only for $33.00 for stocking fees and all the other things listed I had to pay for.  I feel like I shouldn't have been charged those fees when neither one of the items worked when I received them.
2,"The product seems to perform nicely however, it is very difficult for me to read the settings. I need to have settings that light up."
1,"One of the reasons I selected this Toshiba microwave was that it could connect to Alexa. The first bullet point under About This Item said, ""Hands-Free Operation – This microwave is integrated with Alexa and using an echo device (not included) brings convenience by allowing hands free operation by voice command or app control.""However, to connect to Alexa I needed to use the MSmartLife app, which didn't work. I was asked to give the app permission to make and manage phone calls, access my contacts, and access photos and media on my phone. This is a lot of permissions to give to be able to warm something up in the microwave. Seems like it's on the spyware continuum. Be sure to read the MSmartLife app reviews before you make a purchase. This microwave had good reviews, but the app is dreadful. Check the app's reviews. It doesn't do what it's supposed to do - connect Alexa to the microwave."
2,Works well for cooking.  I dislike the way the plate does not stay in place.  Got to fix it with every use.  I dislike that the inside stays wet after use.  I would not buy this item again.
3,"Works, but is heavy and is NOT USING ONLY 1100w. It uses a great deal more than that. So, if you're getting smaller one because you have a solar system, you might want to skip this one. It actually uses up to1850w without the spikes. It puts out 1100, according to it. I called the company and they didn't return my call, when they said they would. Additionally, it creates a lot of moisture when you cook, and if you know anything about microwaves, you know that's a big no-no.After using it for awhile... update! Worst piece of junk I've ever bought. Don't waste your money on it.Moisture inside from cooking anything is ridiculous! Uses way more electricity, so expect your electric bill to jump up ""significantly."" I had to unplug it so it doesn't creep out electricity, repeatedly, which it does, automatically. I don't purchase anything until I know how it will affect my electric usage, and this one sent my electric bill into overdrive! Most of my things are on solar, so I can tell if anything sets it off. This microwave will set you back by about $40-50.00 extra a month WITHOUT changes in your electric usage or the current price increases... just by itself. Run, don't walk."
3,"This microwave does a good job in terms of heating food, it's primary job. But, the keypad is poorly laid out and difficult to see in dim lighting and the door shuts with a loud cheap-sounding ""clank"" and not a nice ""thunk"" like my previous microwave did. Because of the two negatives, I wouldn't purchase another of this model."
5,Works great
1,"My built-in microwave died recently after a verrrrry long life, and finding a replacement was a major ordeal. Because I don’t know how long until I have a new microwave installed, I decided to buy one that was priced low to get me through the wait. I use my microwave every day to reheat things like soup or casseroles. Unfortunately, this Black & Decker is a piece of junk. I can’t even use it for reheating ☹️  Maybe it would work for students in a dorm who just need something to make popcorn or other microwave-ready foods, but it’s useless in an adult kitchen."
2,"so you may think you need 700 watts to run this, as it says 700 so many times, but the back of the device says on the label, 1050 input power, 700 watt output in microwave power.am I the only one who thought it was a microwave that would consume 700 watts ?"
1,Ordered twice both times it was delivered damaged. I gave up and did not try again.
2,"In general this microwave worked ok.  It had nice features and was easy to run and clean, but it often had problems.  Sometimes it just wouldn't work or would switch to a different power level on its own.  I often had to unplug it, wait, then plug it back in for it to reset.  Eventually, it just DIED after 3 years of light use.  I strongly feel a microwave should work better than that.  NO, I would not buy this microwave again and do not recommend it."
2,Timer is horrible. 30 seconds at a time. Same size as my old microwave yet our bacon cooker doesn't fit. Took 10 minutes to cook 6 pieces.
4,It works for small spaces
2,"For a small oven, it heats food well, the controls are easy to use, and it has no annoying quirks. About 10 days ago, however, the interior LED started to strobe unpredictably when the oven was on. The food would cook as usual, but the light show would stop only after the food was removed and the oven door was closed. Fast forward to this evening, and the LED seems like it's on its last legs. It's so dim that it's useless. I filed a warranty claim on the Toshiba website, but I don't have a reply from them. (You submit a form and then get message on the web page that it was submitted successfully... This does not inspire any confidence that I'll ever hear from them - I didn't get any auto-reply.)  I understand that this is a $100 appliance and that it's not going to last 20 years. But 3 1/2 months??? C'mon. This is a warning to consider your choice carefully."
1,"Would give it a ""0"" stars if possible."
5,"I found this microwave offered at an ""open box"" price with ""like new"" condition noted. Upon arrival, the shipping box was badly damaged, which is why I think it was an ""open box"" but the microwave was packaged so well, there was zero damage. Microwave still had the original packaging by the manufacturer, so it wasn't a return. It looks great, works great and I couldn't be happier."
5,This good looking little guy has saved me a bunch of counter space area by fitting on a shelf under a butcher block! It is less powerful than larger models so sometimes you have to add a little time. Worth it.
2,"I hate to have to leave a negative review. I purchased this 07/19 and recently the lightbulb starting flickering on/off. Then the light just went out. I guess I can deal with this, I thought. Until it intermittently stops before time is up. Trying to restart, it's not registering my keypad commands and instead, comes up with a random time (only seconds.)Toshiba needs to work on their Quality Control issues regarding this product. I will be buying another small microwave, again, but not from Toshiba. It was fine while it lasted but 9 months is too shortnbof a time for such failures."
1,"Product did not have a manufacturers box or proper shipping packaging.  When opened plain brown box, broken peices of plastic fell out.  Looked like a return.  Never removed from box."
4,"Easy to use, for heating foods,"
2,"It cooks wonderfully and seems very nice. However: even on a circuit with nothing else plugged in it constantly trips a circuit breaker in our home (built in 2016 so solid wiring), and not predictably either. Finally had to buy a lower power one"
3,Got this a couple months ago.  I'm shocked about how hot plates and serving containers get in this oven.  Even the turntable plate gets SCORCHING hot with as little as 2 minutes cook time.  Grill function is absolutely not worth it.  Had some potatoes in there to cook for 20 minutes on the grill setting and they were still raw.I would not rebuy it.
4,"Sorry I’ve only used it once but so far so good. Noise not a problem to me. Light weight... easy to move around compared to my old one that gave out after ten years. Haven’t tried to put a serving dish in yet. Will get back to you on that. Love the quick turn on buttons. Very pretty color & design. Popped on top of fridge. Had to get help to get the old one down....was very heavy.I research several days to find one with at least 1000 watts...possibly fit a large serving dish...one I could pick up on my own...will not rust from inside because of steam accumulation ( I had read that the inverter technology/ genius mode causes steam build up that had to be taken care of after each use)...had a handle... light up when door opens... easy to clean.VERY DIFFICULT search. Way to many bad reviews on most, including this one to be honest.Got this because of size, weight, appearance, and FARBERWARE name.Most appliances today don’t last like the older ones did. To be honest, if this doesn’t last, I’m saving the box and will ship back if possible. At least, it’s not to heavy to get down off fridge!"
4,I love this microwave. The design is beautiful and it fits perfectly in my kitchen. It took me a second to understand how exactly every function works. But it is definitely worth the money and the time to learn. Sometimes the sensor reheat doesn't properly reheat a dish..but 10 seconds of regular power will fix it. Overall I'm very happy with it....and it looks great!
2,"This microwave oven worked well for fifteen months. used it today and nothing. made noise, turned food but didnt heat. Is 15 months the life expectancy for a microwave? I sat B.S., PIECE OF JUNK."
4,Its a microwave..I put in cold food it comes out hot. It does what its supposed to do. Keypad is a bit quirky at times I think. Have to hit it just right. Other than that its good
5,Good product
2,"Decent run off the mill microwave. Good size, a little loud (but nothing over offensive), just over a hundred $, & from a known brand. We use it 5-10 times a day in average. Fast forward 2 months in, go to heat up the morning coffee & fuse trips. No other appliances were going at the time, so flipped the fuse at the breaker box, try the microwave again & fuse trips again. Take the microwave to another room & same thing. Now we get to see how well the 1 year warranty process goes. Will update when that's done."
1,"After about a year of satisfied use, I noticed that the plastic control touchpad seemed to be separating, but was still usable. The digital display had also started to lose parts of the numbers, but again, could still be used.  A few months later, I noticed that the interior paint had become faded and dull, even though I have never used harsh chemicals to clean it.  After less than 2 years I noticed a little bubbling of the paint under the glass turntable. It is now completely peeling off leaving bare metal. I wish I had reported this to Farberware or Amazon earlier, but with the pandemic, I have had many other things on my mind!  I just Googled this and found that this seems to be a problem that others have had, and have been advised that this microwave can not be fixed and should be discarded due to risk of shorting and fires!  This was not a cheap product and I expected it to last longer than this!"
5,I just got it today and have been using it. It works great
5,"There's really nothing I dislike about it, works great for my purposes."
4,"I purchased this during the last Prime days to upgrade a 20 year old 700 watt microwave. It's bigger, more powerful and has more features than the old one for sure. As some have said, the first column of numbers, 1,4 and 7 are a little hard to push. It seems that the sensor for those are a little off center. I'm learning where they are but got used to fumbling a little quickly.That is really the only thing I have any issues with. I am a basic microwave user. I mostly reheat food. Might cook a baked potato now and then, rarely defrost anything. I saw other reviews complaining that serving trays are too big to move inside the microwave and I have to wonder at the size of serving tray these people are using. I have a few large round plates and they fit and spin just fine.Food heats up nicely and evenly. All the options seem to work. Much quieter than my old one. For me, a winner. Would be 5 stars if I didn't have to press '1' a few times to get those last 15 seconds of reheating done..."
5,The one thing I truly love of this microwave is the grey interior. It doesn’t look constantly dirty as the white interiors do.
4,With no option to turn off the menu beeping. this microwave is the noisiest one I've ever bought. Besides how loud the beeping is. it's great easy to use microwave with nice options such as a child lock and a memory mode to save your favorite timing options but due to how loud the beeping is and how very noisy it is I cannot give it 5 stars. Please make it a option to at least turn off the beeps for selecting the menu buttons.
1,"I like the size and style of the microwave but I've had problems with 2 in 2 months.  The first one seemed OK but after a week or so it became very loud throughout the entire cooking process. The sensor cooking feature over cooked everything, I had to manually stop the cooking for fear of starting a fire.  The second one I received is quieter but it too doesn't seem to shut off during sensor cooking and it tripped by GFCI outlet twice in one week.  I hooked up a ""Kill a watt"" device to detect current draw and it was pulling just over 16.5 Amps.  That's 4 Amps higher than what it's spec'd to draw.  Returning before it sets my house on fire."
1,"We were excited to receive this but when taken out of the box it had multiple dents on the side, and this sticker (see photo) to “remove film” was partly peeled as if someone prior tried to remove it. There was no film to remove either. Looks like we were sent someone else’s return. The shipping box was packaged well so I don’t  think it was damaged on route."
5,The one touch timer buttons are definitely a plus.  You can select 1 to 6 minutes just by pressing which button times you want.
5,My daughter has a microwave!!!! Very handy. From oatmeal to ramen noodles. Now she can cook it all at her dorm.
5,"It arrived just when I expected it to. It is 900 watts. My last microwave was 1000 Watts. I snack on popcorn sometimes. The 1000 watts burned my popcorn if I didn't lower the settings and even then if I don't watch close it burned. My new Black and Decker 900 Watts is perfect for popcorn. Some other things, I cook/warm up, need a little more time.  I don't mind that  at all, slower when cooking is better. It was easy to set up and to set the time. It is easy to use. If you like a 900 watt microw wave I recommend this Black and decker. I use it everyday."
1,"As a micro it works! However, I paid the extra $$$ for a combo unit.The convection oven burns and smokes before even coming up to temp. Food instantly looks like a black s’more! We have a convection/micro in rv and it works perfectly!Do not buy!!!!"
2,"This came packaged fairly well, but when I took it out of the box, one of the little knobby things it uses for ""legs"" was dented up into the bottom of the frame, like it had been dropped very hard on that side. I ended up putting a piece of wood under it to level it. One of the reviews also mentioned that the heating tray inside would not stay in place and I find that to be true also. It has no notches in the center of the plate to hold it centered, so it clanks and pops when it is rotating. You can eventually sort of center it, but it's a pain!. I got it for my camper and I guess it will do for that, but I would definitely not recommend it to a friend! Its way to much of a hassle  for me to send it back so I will live with it. Just beware, it's not a great product!"
5,"I have been using this microwave every day for a year or two multiple times per day. It is a great little microwave. It fits a full-sized plate and can also fit most any regular dinner entree (probably not family size though). The only thing you have to think about though is adding a couple minutes on to the microwave time suggested because most mealtimes listed assume you have a bigger microwave.There is a chart online that lists adjustment times for a smaller microwave like this one. Even though I have to cook things for 2-3 extra minutes I find the small size definitely worth it. This microwave fits perfectly on top of my small refrigerator. It is a great space saver.It has handy buttons for cooking frozen vegetables, hot drinks, and more. It is very easy to use and very easy to clean. Occasionally the glass cooking tray comes lose from the holder and it rattles a little, but I find this happens rarely and is not really an issue of concern.All and all I highly recommend this powerful little microwave. From what I remember it was not too expensive and it has served me well for a year or two and hopefully many more.Thanks for reading and good luck!"
4,Works great! We have a very small limited space and this microwave worked perfectly for the space.
4,The over works great but food such as potatoes do not cook evenly.
2,"This microwave cooks beautifully, but is very noisy. Also it is not as simple to use as my previous one, requiring multiple steps to start even simple tasks.I’ve had it for 11 months now and the start button is only working about half the time. Now I’m going to have to try to get it fixed under warranty. What a pain!!Not recommended at this point"
5,very nice size and quality.  well made and light weight
2,Got rusty inside after about six months or so. The rear corner showed couple brown spots. Tried to wash it off but couldn't. Then two months ago white paint started peeling off right where glass wheels spin.
5,It's so sleek and fits perfectly to my decor. So happy I bought it.
4,"This microwave is cute and the right size for our apartment. I like that the inside is dark gray instead of white. Only issue we had was that the top is banged up, I guess during delivery."
2,"The unit stopped working completely. 11 months old , with no service centers to send to or persons to talk to"
5,"It took a while for me to find one that is not white inside, but gray a deep gray. We threw away our other one. It was so nasty inside. It was beautiful on the outside it was red, but we kept cleaning the inside. Then we realized it was all peeling Never get a white inside microwave!!"
4,I don’t use a microwave to cook but this is quite serviceable for quick reheats.
2,"Toshiba is supposed to be one of the best microwaves. I think it is otherwise. Makes grumbling sound when it starts; like it doesn't have enough power to turn the table. Has no reset button, an on/off button that doesn't work and is sort of klunky overall. Wish I stayed with my other brand"
5,Works fine
5,"I've used the microwave, convection oven and air fryer functions on this unit and my only complaint is that the instructions leave a lot to be desired. However, the equipment itself is smart enough to tell me what to do for most of it. The microwave works the same as most other microwaves... except that pushing a number to set the time will immediately start the microwave for that number of minutes. In other words, if you push the number one, it immediately starts running for 1 minute; push number 2 and it runs for 2 minutes, and so on. That's actually a wonderful feature in my opinion.The oven works by pushing Conv, then push it multiple times to get to the temperature you want. Push start and it begins to preheat. When the flashing ""FOOD"" appears, put your item into the oven, and either use the time or just push the number buttons for the time you want to bake. My baked goods turned out just right every time so far.Air fry - use the tall rack and the pan that come with the unit. Push ""Air Fry"" and it will prompt you for further information. There are some common foods preset but you must use the owners manual to find them. They aren't the least bit intuitive.Overall, I am very happy with this appliance. Better instructions and a few recipes would be a definite plus but so far at least, I'm not having any problems with it. I do recommend you try some simple things first rather than trying to do an expensive roast or steaks the first time. I made a box mix package of scones to test the oven part and I did frozen chicken nuggets to test the air fryer."
2,"Maybe I should try commanding this device through Alexa.It works splendidly well but for one piece of truly idiotic design: In order to make it run for anything other than its pre-set, one-button times (30 seconds, one minute, two minutes), you have to press the button which is there to BOTH set the time (press twice) and set the clock (press once).Why? In the first place, why does the same button control both?  Second, why in the name of heaven is it ONE button to set the CLOCK, but TWO every time you want to set the cook time?  That would be merely an annoyance if it actually worked that way.  But about 75% of the time that I press twice to set cook time, it starts to re-set the clock -- which means that not only does it not start to cook, but it also erases the time of day.  I wish I'd never bought this thing, which works brilliantly except for the brains part."
4,Replaced earlier model w this one. Slightly bigger and bit more powerful. Like the light and new interior.
2,I purchased because of the reviews and because I needed something small and I needed it quickly. The reviews made this microwave sound amazing….mine is not. I takes sooooo long to heat anything up. Something that my old microwave heated up in a minute…..this one take 2-3 minutes. It doesn’t seem defective it just seems weak. If I didn’t really need it I would have returned it.
1,"The shipping was prompt.  The damage to the box by UPS is inexcusable.  They have been extremely lazy and careless at their jobs, especially items marked ""fragile"".  It's a game to them to see how much damage they can do to those marked in this way.  However, the box the microwave came in was not damaged, just the box the box was in.  Pulled the microwave out and it was beautiful.  Then I plugged it in.  It sparked, smelled and made high pitched sounds like it was going to explode.  My husband got home a day after I had it set up.  He listened to it and immediately requested a replacement Microwave. It would heat some food REALLY hot in just a minute and other foods not at all.  But the glass plate and the top of the microwave would get so hot that you couldn't touch them.  Not good.  Got the new one in today.  Excited!  Pulled it out, plugged it in...SAME EXACT THING!  Can't touch the glass plate it comes with as it burned my fingers and can't touch the top on the OUTSIDE of the machine.  Microwaves are NOT suppose to get hot on the outside.  This is  dangerous machine and it sounds, smells and feels like it will easily cause a fire!  GET A DIFFERENT BRAND!  Once could be coincidental.  Two times...not so much!"
4,Small is perfect
5,"This combo micro and convection oven is exactly what we wanted.  We are very pleased with it for several reasons:1.  It saves space by combining 2 appliances but it is not compact so measure how it will fit on your counter first.  2.  The quality is very high and for the basic features it is very easy to use  (the users manual or videos come in handy for some the more complex functions).  3. we received it faster than expected and set up took less than 3 minutes.  I consider this a good value - features, quality, price.The interior is gleaming stainless steel that will be easy to clean, it is well lit,  and the convection function has performed well on the couple of items we've baked.  You can also use the mico and convection together.I highly recommend this oven and would buy it again, but be sure to measure your counter space first, it is not a compact unit."
4,"Works nicely. The buttons are a bit hard at times. Hard to get them to work Overall though, a nice unitIt cooks for us, just fne."
3,Smaller than I thought and not very good.
4,This microwave is so simple to use. It even comes with instructions. It's perfect for small spaces.
4,Much stronger than our last microwave this size. To set the time to cook you first have to push Time Cook which I find a bit annoying but I realize many microwaves work like that.
2,"It’s a good microwave for the price. Perfect for small kitchen and counter space. But, I got a damaged piece because the microwave was leaking oil and it smelled like machine oil not oil from food. The leak was under the microwave. I know it sounds weird because I have never seen this before but it did happen and I had to return the microwave. So good luck if you get a good piece."
1,"Stopped working, barely used"
1,"I had heard of the brand Farberware before and figured it would be a good unit for our space.  Plus it had so many good reviews.  As soon as we started using it, it made an annoying winding noise when the turntable started spinning but we dealt with it for the price of the unit.  After a few days of use, we noticed a lot of steam collects in the microwave during use and doesn't vent.  When you open the door, the inside is often wet all over and full of steam no matter what you're heating.  After about 4 months of use, the ""defrost"" button stopped working.  This things continues to fail and disappoint more and more as time goes by.  It's only 6 months old and we wish we never bought it.  Farberware doesn't list microwaves on their website and said they don't warranty this Amazon product?  I don't get it.  That's the 1st and last Farberware product we buy.  Our previous GE microwave lasted a good 10 years with no issues.  Don't but this microwave!  There's too many other good choices."
5,"The clock is super easy to set!  You push the clock button, type the numbers in and then push the clock button again.  Easy!  It also looks nice, fits in the space I wanted it in.  It heats really well and is not loud at all.  I like it!"
4,"This was a nice upgrade in the kitchen! The interior space is great! The small microwaves that are out just don't have the room a family size dish needs. The cooking times are much lower than the unit this replaced.There are three negatives we see. Two basic things are the light inside isn't very bright and seeing through the door is difficult due to the film used inside the door. The third is that for to it being an inverter microwave, it kills the 2.5 GHz WiFi signal while running. This affects the entire band and is a known issue with this microwave tech and WiFi. It's definitely a pain when operating near the kitchen. The general operation is simple."
5,It's compact and  numbers are easy to read..the price was great too .  Love it ❤️
3,"The shipping was good, but the box came damaged. Inside the back of the microwave was dented, but since it is in an area that is hidden when mounted, It doesn't really matter. The big issue is there was no paperwork with the microwave, no install manual, no install templates, and no instruction manual. Luckily I've installed a few of these, but without the install template, I ended up drilling in the wrong place.It's a good looking machine, and it seems to be of good quality.**UPDATE**This microwave is very noisy, it vibrates inside, seems to have poor fitting internals.After a few months of regular use, the plastic became very brittle. Pieces just fell off. First, the grate cover fell off (plastic pieces broke with no pressure applied). Then, plastic decorative pieces around the handle started falling off randomly. Have had to fix using tape and epoxy. Works ok, just noisy and ugly."
2,"1) Buttons too hard to read (should be bright white, not gray letters/numbers)2) First use instructions don't even work! -- bad quality control for instructionsTurning off beep does not work (section ""Using the Microwave for the First Time"", item #3).(Web searches confirm the beep cannot be turned off, contrary to instructions).Toggling kg-lb does not work (section ""Using the Microwave for the First Time"", item #2).This microwave is also much louder than my 15 year same size one (not to mention the rattling noise).Loud enough to be unusable."
3,"I noticed it is lighter weight then I thought, and moves when I push the door open button. It also has a very annoying, 4 beep timer. There is no way to reset it. It also does not cook as fast as my last microwave, but probably because it is smaller, and has a lower wattage."
1,Plugged it in and it doesn’t work. Don’t waste your time
5,We purchased the smaller version of this microwave and sent it back----it was just too small.  This one is the same high quality and a little larger.
4,Love this Microwave.  Use it for all cooking needs.
5,Me encantó el tamaño
1,"I had originally given this microwave a five-star review. However, after it stopped working 10 months after purchasing, I'm changing it to a one star review, especially after dealing with Toshiba customer service. This unit was purchased from Amazon as ""Like New"" condition and it was genuinely like new when I received it. It seemed to work fine and I loved the Alexa integration aspect of it (the main reason why I purchased this microwave).Then after 10 months, it stopped working and I contacted Toshiba thinking (stupidly) that this would be covered by their 1-year warranty. It turns out that ""Like New"" is considered ""used"" by Toshiba and thus, they won't cover the repair/replacement of the unit (according to Kelsey W. of Toshiba Lifestyle support). I'm surprised because I've actually had other companies offer their warranty coverage of these types of products that I purchased through Amazon in the past, but I guess Toshiba isn't one of them. So, be aware that if you don't buy this brand new, it won't be covered by warranty. My old one was sadly tossed.I did purchase another one of these units (brand new this time) and I'll update my review as I see how that one lasts in the next year. I just love the Alexa integration so that's why I purchased another of these, but if another company were to start incorporating the Alexa compatibility, I'll be much more apt to purchase from someone other than Toshiba (and you bet that I'll be avoiding their products in the future).Update: the new one keeps losing its internet connection. Seriously I hate this microwave and I’ll steer clear of any Toshiba products in the future."
1,"this is pretty to look at, the light inside is ok. the inside is smaller then it says and its a dark greylining. the clock,read out is bright blue and it lights up the entire kitchen and half the living room at night . much too bright. it heats food good and quick.. But the entire thing  is waaayyy to loud. the door is loud and clunky and cheap sounding when opening and closing.  while its running its very loud, I'm about to return it ."
4,It's a really nice microwave and works good. It's a little louder than I expected but not much loader. Louder than my last microwave
3,"The clock on mine doesn't keep time, which is unfortunate a deal breaker for me. It's easy enough to set it, but then just 20 minutes later the time is fast by 3-4 minutes. Everything else seems to work, though it takes longer to cook things than I'd expect even from a microwave of this tiny size and low power."
3,"Bought it to replace our comfee air fryer that we loved.... And our microwave. Figured we combine two into one. This unit takes literally 10 times longer if not more to air fry, as far as the microwave it fine but could find something comparable for a much better price"
2,Pro: can boil water in 1 minCon: can't defrost ground beef in 5 min
5,"Love this microwave. Its big enough for us, quiet noise, and easy to press the numbers. Also heats up quickly like we want. Thanks"
1,purchased for home use stopped working after 6 weeks. Never a live person to help. Wants me to pay postage to send it for repair. Dropped it there will not ever order a Panasonic item again Very disappointed If there was a rating lower then one star I would use it. Hope this helps prospective buyers. This item is a piece of crap.
3,"It works, and has all the more complicated functions.  I am pleased with the price and purchase.  Priced right ~ $50 ~ because I got a refurbed model, but someone probably returned it for the simple reason that on the stainless model you cannot read the button labels hardly at all daytime or night."
1,"I bought this Microwave less than a year ago for my dance teachers to be able to have food in between classes. It was perfect at first, but today after not being touched in over 48 hours it had an electric short and caught on fire. I was not supposed to be in my dance studio today. Thank goodness I stopped by! When I arrived, I was taking care of the paperwork and started to smell something strange. That's when I found it! I have looked through all the reviews and similar stories are starting to pop up."
3,"I bought this to replace Model NNSD681S, which I liked a lot (better than this more costly one), after it just stopped working after 4.5 years.  The Panasonic microwave that one replaced lasted about 20 years.  Reliability is everything—this microwave seemed to have fewer malfunction complaints.  It seems okay, but it has one issue: the keyboard freezes regularly if you want to use it two or more times in a short time, needing a press of the Stop/Reset button to unlock the numeric keypad.  If you haven't used the microwave in hours, it works without issue.  I just hope this is not a precursor to another premature death.  If so, I will have to shop for a different brand.  Crossing my fingers (not high praise for a name brand)."
4,"This unit works as advertised.... Only one problem, you cant read the names on the control panel unless its in bright light.  impossible to see controls in the dark ever with door open. this is a major design fault"
3,Too noisy to operate in a smaller kitchen.
1,stopped working after 6 weeks trying to get it replaced
3,"The packaging lacks a good instrucyion manual. Its geared to work voice controlled with Alexa but if ur wifi goes out, the microwave does not respond. Their are no clear instructions on how to manually operate the microwave. It took numerous hours of trialband error to figure it out. When it works as expected, itsca great product but the app could use restructuring."
3,It's pretty dinky but it gets the job done for first-apartmenters like me
1,"I used this weekly for about 8 months, it worked fine. After 8 months it started smoking- toxic smoke that filled our house. GE has a ridiculous policy where you have to jump through hoops to get a ""good will certificate"" to purchase the exact item again. Don't waste your money."
3,Was expecting a little bigger of a Microwave. Its pretty small for the price.
1,Broke after one year of use
1,"It’s cheap and unreliable. I always have to guess how long to cook extra, usually have to add at least another 90 seconds to any recipe etc."
4,I liked how it matched my other appliances and that it was easy to set up and use.  It is a little noisy but I guess I'm getting use to it.
5,Just like my old one. Same buttons and settings. Had the old one for 9 years!
5,So far it is easy to use.  My main reason for purchasing it is because I needed a new microwave and this one had the extra features.  It is easy to use and I have had no problems using it.  I really like it.
4,Works very well for I use it for.
5,"Wonderful small microwave for limited counter space. The price is very affordable. Extremely easy panel to read.If you're looking for an economical , space saving micro-w,This is the one."
2,After 18 months it started sparking from the inside and was unsafe to use.  Could not get ahold of anyone for warranty
1,Used it 2 times and on the second time it caught on fire!!! Luckily I had been near by and was able to put it out fast!
3,"So far the oven and microwave seem to work well. My main complaint is there are no stationary Reck’s so you can’t bake anything other than what can be placed on the rotating plate, like an oblong casserole dish. The round racks are ridiculous because they slide around on the glass plate. My GEAdvantium has a 2 level rack option so You can bake 2 pans at once. No reason that I can see why the same couldn’t have been done with this one. I bought this one for a efficiency apartment."
4,"my older model ZE2160 broke, and I wanted to try the Air fry. But I found out the problem with the older one. So I will try to fix it and give the new one away.I fixed the ZE2160 by spraying WD40 specialist contact cleaner into the 3 openings in front after opening the door. Then I opened and closed the door several times, let it sit for a while, plugged it in and voila it worked again. I am really happy.I really don't like the new Microwave, hard to read, also noticed my counter gets hot."
5,This replaced a unit I had for about 6 years. A few reviews mentioned that the controls are hard to use. That couldn't be further from the truth. It's a basic microwave and it's easy. It does what it's intended.
4,"Replaced old GE Microwave because it rusted inside, but was still working great with this B&D Microwave.  This one is really nice looking and it's hard to find a Black microwave.  I guess price was o.k. they all seem to be around this price range.  Old GE defrosted some items in 30 seconds, this B&D needs a lot more time, 2.5-3 minutes to defrost a bagel or bialy. Will try 30 second express cooking to see how that works for bagels and bialys.  I guess reheating something will also take longer so time will have to be added to that as well. I seem to have good luck with B&D appliances (toaster oven is B&D and I love it) so I'm hoping this appliance won't break down on me, however, to be on the safe side purchased 4 year warranty just in case.  I like that it's lit up inside so you can see what's going on and like the ending beep so you know food is done.  I don't find it noisy at all.  In general I will have to use it for a while to make friends with it as it works very differently than old GE.  I also like the push button release to open the microwave."
2,Started chipping inside door within 6 mons. Was rusted underneath.
4,"This is a decent microwave for the price. The only issues I have are that the door handle is a little strange, and the power is kind of low so things take way longer. I didn’t realize that when I got it so that’s my fault for not looking at the wattage. It’s compact and that’s why I chose it because I have limited counter space."
3,"This thing is good for little plates of food, but if you like to eat, like me, then you need a bigger microwave or be very patient.  Typically it takes up to 4 or 5 minutes to heat up a plate of food.  In most cases its easier to throw your food on the stove.  If you eat a lot of pre-packaged microwave meals, do not buy this.  Get one with 1000W.The part I do like about this thing, is how small it is.  I have a small galley kitchen and it fits snug in the corner and doesn't take up too much counter space."
3,"I had a convection microwave in my last motor home, so I was familiar with how they should work.  I could cook anything in the motor home, but sadly this one is too weak to cook even a small pork roast.  I put together the roast, preheated the oven and in two hours it was still not cooked.  The potatoes and carrots were drying out and crunchy - after two hours!  When you get it preheated it struggles to maintain that heat.  It looks nice and the microwave works well, but this is not the countertop oven you are looking for, and it sure isn't worth nearly double what I paid for it last year.  Pass."
1,The microwave started to make a lot of rattling noise which has gotten very loud.  I don't trust using it.Regret big time buying it.  It's been over a month since I followed instructions and contacted the company and I have yet to hear from them.
4,"We needed to replace our microwave (different brand).  We needed wattage, size and functions. This has been a great replacement from a trusted brand. Will purchase again."
1,"Returning- set off fire alarm @ 4 minutes- knocked tv and remote out twice, turntable so hot I couldnt touch it-"
3,"Convection oven is slow, microwave works great. Doesn’t work like I expected"
4,"We have used all the features yet, but it seems quality. The biggest gripe is it’s very difficult to read the buttons. Adding some back lighting to the control panel would be a huge improvement."
4,"Very easy to use.  Heats/cooks well.  Interior is easy to clean up spatters.Unfortunately, my microwave oven's partial power feature is completely inoperative: will only show PL10 (full power) when is the oven is operating, and cannot decrement to lower power levels.  For me, this is something I can live with: my needs are simple and don't include partial power.  It'd be too much of  hassle for me to repackage and return the oven and do without the microwave convenience; for someone whose requirements are more sophisticated than mine, this would be a major issue.Update June 5, 2019: I don't know why, but I just checked, and the Power button is working to adjust power levels!  Maybe the touchpad needed to age a bit, but whatever - - this is a fine purchase, and I have no regrets about it."
4,I bought this microwave 2 years ago.Today it shorted and the inside started sparking and burned.I don't believe I have a warranty.Any advice out there about whether its worth repairing?Thanks
3,"Looks good, works well, but why so noisy? Very loud for a microwave!"
5,Works just like I expected!
2,In addition to the other shortcomings of this microwave my main pet peeve is that the operator panel is not backlit  - only the time is backlit.  You will need a flashlight to operate in dim light.  Escapes me how Toshiba designers did not provide this feature.
2,Terriable microwave:Slides all overButtons not lightedButtons hard to activate  especially  to openOnly ordsred because i could not go to Best Buy  because of the VirusDO NOT BUY
5,"Well made microwave!This microwave has a spacious interior that accommodates a variety of bowl sizes, making it suitable for both single servings and family meals. The turntable ensures even heating.The noise level is minimal compared to other microwaves."
4,Pretty good for the price. Wives nails ruined buttons
3,"I have to admit I just unpacked the unit and haven’t used it yet. That is because the manual contains very little information on how to use the different features. There is an air fryer insert. But what about the convection portion or the broiler? I am disappointed in GE.As another reviewer said, I also don’t have a printer. I don’t appreciate having to search for a manual. I believe a complete manual should be packed with the unit.I have owned many GE products in my lifetime (age 70) satisfactorily. An incomplete manual is kind of out of left field."
3,"Pros: Heats well. Powerful unit.Cons: Keypad lettering is difficult to see especially if you locate the oven in a dark corner.Cons: Lettering on the four function buttons is wearing off after a relatively short time.Cons: Needs one too many key presses. To cancel cooking you must press the stop button and once more to reset to zero cooking time.. Or to use the 30 sec button function you must press it, then follow it with the start button. It should be more shortcut like other microwaves."
2,"The microwave cooks fine, and is much quieter than the 24 year old microwave it replaces. I just assumed the inside of the oven would be white, like all microwaves seem to be... my mistake. This oven has a charcoal-colored interior, lit with a dim blue LED light. it is definitely dark inside, which IMO ruins an otherwise fine inexpensive oven. I am quite disappointed."
4,Nice microwave but very loud.
1,Bought July 24 and it stopped heating first week of September.  Of course after the return window had closed August 23!  Horrible product!!!!  To the trash it goes!!!!
3,"The microwave itself works fine but it is LOUD!! Don’t try to run the microwave while holding a sleeping baby (which we have) because the baby will wake up, for sure!! Most noisy microwave I’ve ever owned."
5,Works very well for me.
2,"Its compact and nice, but too big and bulky to fit in a storage area. It takes longer to microwave due to the lower watt. Not worth the 75 i paid for something so $30usd worth."
5,Looks good.  Works great.  Nice selection for us .
1,"The media could not be loaded.For some reason, this microwave completely shuts down when overworked (more than 5 minutes).  It makes one clicking sound and then powers off completely.  No digital display, no oven light, nothing.  Overheating maybe?  Right side of microwave gets hot.  I guessing some sort of fuse is being triggered.  Comes back to life after several minutes.  Will work for light duty microwaving for a minute or 2.  Otherwise, avoid this piece of junk."
3,"Good overall mircrowave, functions fine but only had it short period of time. Kinda upset I got false reviews on how the product looked, but still has a nice look."
4,Nice product for the price. It's a little noisy but that's ok I just use it to warm up stuff.
1,"I purchased this microwave in May of this year, it's been a month in a half since I purchased it and it no longer works I hardly use it. DON'T BUY THIS MICROWAVE."
1,"I'll keep this review short and to the point. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!Not only was this item damaged in transit, but it is very poorly made. I doubt seriously if this unit is even significantly shielded against radiation leaks. Plugged it in once and struggled to set the clock. Not that it was difficult, you had to really apply pressure to the control panel buttons. Sometimes they registered, other times no. Tried to boil water in two cup glass measuring cup. WOW! This thing howls! Very noisy! I unplugged unit and sent it back.I still need a small microwave, but I think I'll spend a few bucks and get something I can depend on of high quality. This unit is junk!"
1,The media could not be loaded.Had to submit a return for some reason it made nosie's like an internal fan was striking an object make the same sound as if you had put a old trading card in your bike spokes as a kid.  Still waiting on my refund to post to my account.
5,"Very happy with this microwave. Good value for the money.  Easy to use with different functions. Quiet. The door latch to open it was somewhat stiff, but is easier with use. I do wish the alert when food is done was louder. Other than that. I really like it."
5,Our previous Microwave Oven was a Sharpe which lasted over 10 years. I fully expect this new Farberware we purchased to meet that same duration of service.
1,Bought this for my grandson to take to school.  It doesn't work right; Shuts off  after 2 minutes. Total waste of money/
2,The microwave  fine but my food doesnt cook evenly because the glass tray and the spinner do not fit properly. We always have to fumble with  it so that its in place and it gets off track so easily. Its very frustrating. I wonder if the wrong size glass tray and spinner was packaged with my microwave.
1,"I'd like to just start off this sad tale by stating that there was no sign of damage to the box or the packaging, and no sign of damage to the unit itself when I unpacked it; however, the door to this thing was so misaligned that it hits the console pad when trying to close it. Also, the first time I started it up, it made a sound like a chainsaw so I immediately shut it off. No very promising so far, eh?After assessing the problems, I thought to myself, do I send it back? Hell no - I'm hungry and these TV dinners take ages in a conventional oven. So, I voided the warranty and took it apart. What a piece of junk. The cover to this thing is almost as thin as tinfoil. (Incidentally, it is an ugly fake spray-paint silver color, not stainless, so it also looks like the piece of garbage that it is.) Once the cover was apart, I quickly saw that the chainsaw sound was the fan hitting the power supply's plastic shroud, so I clipped back the offending plastic edge - one problem solved. I then loosened the screws that held on the door, shifted it into a better fitting position, and re-tightened the screws. With the second problem done and feeling proud, I put the cover back on and plug it in.No smoke, good. I set the clock, good. I put my food into the oven, good. I set the time and press start. No smoke and it is sounding normal - awesome! Ten seconds later it stops. What? Did I set the time wrong? I set the time again and press start. It runs for three seconds and then stops, but this time it gives me an H97 code. I look in the manual. H97 means that your cheap ass craptacular microwave has a bad power supply and you need to contact the company to get it replaced. Damn. I took it apart again and looked it over for any signs of loose wires or black streaks, but apart from being about the worst designed thing I've ever clapped eyes on, it looked OK. I reassembled, tried again, and instant H97.So, I imagine some of you are saying, ""Yeah, but, it was probably damaged in shipping and you probably made it worse when you took it apart."" In answer, I say, ""It might very well have been damaged in shipping, but only because it is so cheaply constructed that bumping into it could probably break it. And to the second point, I could understand you thinking so since you do not know me, but I'm not a neanderthal with a crowbar and feel confident in my technical skills as I work with wiring and electronics daily.""So what now? Well, right now I have been cooking my TV dinner in the conventional oven and the timer just went off, so I'm going to eat my sad little dinner. When I've had time to reflect, perhaps I'll have another go at taking this thing apart and giving the power supply a good eyeballing. However, chances are I'll be shopping for another new microwave later tonight.The moral of the story is: don't buy this microwave. And if you do buy it and it has a fault, just send it back and get your money back. Cheers, and good luck intrepid consumers!"
1,"It is one of the worst microwave I've ever used. It uses too much power just to warm food. My primary microwave which is GE takes 1,000 wattage and it warms up food faster and hotter than this piece of crap Toshiba unit. After a year the bulb just dies. The oven mode takes way too long to heat up and due to too many holes in this unit the heatscapes a lot. This means it has to constantly keep the oven mode heat going, eating even more power in that process. It feels like you bought an failed experiment.I tried to changing the light bulb but it's impossible because it's permanently soldered in. There's no way to screw it out. once you open the whole thing up with the proprietary screws you will see how little you can service this microwave"
5,Modern looking and powerful magnetron to quickly heat up food and liquids
3,"My last one was a lower wattage by a couple hundred,  so I wanted something more powerful although the old one serviced me well...  Having limited space was an issue,  so there isn't as many to choose from when that happens. So I went with this one. Good looking,  stainless and black and the smaller size with ample controls is a definite plus. I've owned this now for a couple months and would recommend this. By the way... its very,  very quiet. I've read in other reviews some have taken issue with the loudness of their machines. So,  if quiet operation,  smallness of size,  ample controls are what you're looking for,  I think you've found your new machine..."
1,"Unfortunately there isn't enough air flow and condensation builds up inside the microwave and causes rust.  It started at about 18 months but now at the 2 1/2 year mark it's really trashy looking inside.  Other than that it's an OK microwave in that it heats quickly.  It doesn't have some of the other really basic features that our last microwave had like pushing the ""2"" button to get 20 seconds, the ""4"" button to get 40 seconds, etc.  But it does have a +30 seconds button so that's alright I guess.  When you spend almost $250 you expect a microwave to last as there are plenty of sub-$150 microwaves out there."
2,Way to small
4,Like door handle overpushbutton and the streamlined interior.  Easy to use.  Little noisy but no big  deal
4,"Was a bit smaller inside than expected,  I won't be doing my spaghetti squash in this one. But a great microwave all around"
2,This microwave arrive all dented up. It has a huge dent on the bottom left side where the vents are. The front key pad has a large bubble under the numbers also.
5,The microwave is wonderful but it is large so you need a bog space for it !
1,"Bought this microwave, because of the brand name and product reviews. Don't be fooled like I was. The died almost a year to the day. The microwave was not in heavy use. I mainly used it for popcorn and heat frozen dinners and thaw veggies.  In the user manuals it talks about moisture issues. It's a microwave oven that has problem with moisture . Really!!!! Maybe used it once or twice a week for a few minutes. Don't buy it. Not a good product, waste of money.That is it's a piece of junk.  Very disjointed.  JUNK...."
3,Takes a really long time to heat up any food. Things that normally take 2-3 minutes tops takes 5 to 6 minutes.
4,"December 2022: After owning over six months, it's an ok microwave but takes longer to heat than the similar Panasonic from 11 years ago. Old microwave reheated just about anything in 30 seconds or less. This one takes at least 2 minutes for everything. I also notice more interference than usual with this microwave when I'm using bluetooth.***Note: Took 4 orders and 3 deliveries to receive one that wasn't damaged/clearly used and returned upon arrival***+can turn off all beeping which is the #1 reason I stick with Panasonic+even though I push the button as I close the door, closing the door isn't loud on its own+it's wide+looks ok+to be about 40lbs, it's pretty lightweight-The black finish leaves fingerprints galore after every use-it's tall enough but not as tall as the interior could be-buttons don't light up but I knew this going in-steam is a thing which makes it hard to see through the door-not a fan of the white light, it looks too dim compared to the yellow lighting that illuminates the whole interior-I saw all the complaints about having to press start after the +30 time setting and no one touch operation...I thought how lazy are these people. When you're accustomed to pressing a button and just going about your business, it takes some getting used to having to add an extra step. Not a deal breaker though-only time will tell but something tells me this won't last 10+ years like my previous Panasonic of a similar model"
3,"I had previously owned a small GE microwave that lasted a very long time and loved the size and features and durability.  When the time came to replace it I found this unit which was pretty much the same except with added features.  So I purchased it.  Well, it works fine but I literally have to pick up a flashlight and point it at the touchscreen in order to read the commands in order to run it.  This is RIDICULOUS.  I have undercabinet task lighting that is very bright but because the angle of this unit sticks out just past the edge of the cabinet the light beam just misses the screen and I cannot read it.  Unless I have all my overhead lights on I cannot read this unit.  So if someone wants to pop a microwave bag of popcorn in this or to warm up some water for tea or another hot beverage you need to go in with a miner's cap.  Most annoying thing to do with an appliance like this."
5,"Nice microwave, had to return because it was too small for what we needed"
2,"My 8 year old Panasonic died - much too soon.  My old Magic Chef has been in use for 15 years and is still going strong at my son's home.So I decided to shop for other makers and narrowed my search down to this highly rated Toshiba ML-EM34P(SS).Well, I just dropped it off at my local UPS Store for a return.  Here's why:Pros:++ Looks good++ It worksCons:-- Most of the time I just want to enter a specific cooking time and press start.The Panasonic defaults to this mode - you just enter the time and push start. This oven requires you to push ""Power Level"" twice (couldn't be more COUNTER intuitive!) and then enter the time and push start. Yes, it's usable -- but the feature used most should be the easiest to use rather than requiring extra button pushes.-- Door slams with a loud bang (seriously! Much louder than any other microwave oved I'd owned)-- Kitchen timer seems to be a handy feature - alas it only beeps once at the end of the countdown. Too easy to miss unless you're in the kitchen.  This is just silly.  Kitchen timers should keep beeping till you silence them!-- I didn't buy it for the WiFi / Alexa feature (I think it's just a silly gimmick!), but I wanted to give it a try, hoping I could get an alert on my phone at the end of the cycle.  Well, I couldn't get it to work. You need to download an app before you can integrate with Alexa (assuming you even have an Alexa speaker in the first place.) The app is the worse I have ever seen or tried to use.  It's only rated 2.2 on the Google store - and even that is too generous.  I couldn't get it to work.  You need to sign up for an account, but it kept nagging that my account is not registered when I later tried to log in.-- At the end of cycle the oven beeps, but again only once. A series of beeps would be much better for when you are in the next room."
5,Very nice works great
1,"Started making an awful noise after only a few months of use.  It frightens my dog.  Also, as others have mentioned, the plastic on the keypad has bubbled up and makes the whole appliance look cheap and obnoxious."
4,"I have purchased this product twice. It does take up some counter space, but is spacious and easy to use. I love the censor cook option and It is fantastic for defrosting meat enough to feed my family of 6. It has been an asset to my home. I would buy it again and again. The only drawback seems to be that with time, the door ceases the functionality of the microwave. It is likely a simple fix, but I chose to purchase the product again as opposed to investigating a solution to fix the old one."
5,Bought for our shop at work.Works great for our needs.
2,"I've had this oven for 3 weeks and on multiple occasions, when removing hot food from the oven the clear glass turntable platter is not seated firmly on the turning knob and it SLIPS. It moves around, even though the platter is aligned properly with the turning knob underneath. Today while heating a bowl of soup on a plate, while pulling the soup and plate out of the oven the turntable platter again slipped, resulting in piping hot soup sloshing out and spilling on my hand causing a 1st degree burn. I've have many models of microwaves over the years and none of them had a turntable that came loose when placing or removing food. This design has the potential of seriously scalding someone."
1,"The media could not be loaded.Not even 6 full days of having this microwave and the light starts flickering. According to the manufacturer there is no troubleshooting for this. Have to go though the stress of returning and going without a microwave for probably a week while I wait for a refund. This is the third microwave I've gotten off amazon that I've had to return, albiet this is the first farberware."
2,The dials are very difficult when you press them in the whole microwave moves
1,We thought this product would be the answer to our counter space dilemma but turned out to be a terrible product. It is not easy to use and stopped working in less than 3 months. Only have 30 days to return.
1,"Package was not damaged, however, whomever packaged this microwave paid no attention to the obvious bent door frame, bent frame behind the door, crushed and jammed Upper door switch, and the skewed and crooked touch pad installation.  It would not start and could not start based on the assembly. Worse I’ve ever seen in a supposedly “from the factory” product.  I packed it up and sent it back immediately.  No one should ever receive a product so poorly presented.  It seems they wanted the crappiest rating ever.  I’d give it a negative rating if it was possible.Greg"
3,The most obvious thing was noise coming from the right side when the microwave was running.  I opened the case and repositioned the fan cowl.  It has been ok for a couple of days.  The continuing aggravation is the keypad.  The buttons are hard to push.  They are sensitive to position and press firmness.  I had an old microwave that lasted 25 years.  It was easy to use.  Key time and press start.  Big buttons.  Oh well...
2,"So I want to start by saying I really think this microwave is good enough and the wattage is decent to cook things quickly. Now I've had this for about 3 years and it still cooks things quickly. A few months after buying in 2019 the bulb starts flickering and dies. I called the support line, explain what's going on with the flickering and am told that it doesnt effect the functioning of the unit and that there's no option to change the light out. The light not working is bothersome because you cant see the food to prevent a mess if its bubbling up. An LED light should not stop working under a year. Moral of the story is, make sure to buy the extended warranty protection so you can at least get your money back for a faulty product."
4,I love it 🥰 it’s so spacious for my countertop. It fit well ❤️
4,"Convenient, works well and good price"
4,it's good.  just takes longer to heat things up.  we had to buy a smaller one because not enough space.
1,It takes entirely too long to air fry. My old air fryer would cook something in 11-12  minutes.  This takes 20-30 minutes. It also gets very hot. Soo hot that is has to be pulled away from the wall and away from any items and it does not feel safe. If you touch the back while cooking it will burn you. Will be giving it away or trashing it because it's too late to return.
5,I just got this after a different brand wasn't making my 2 regular items to my satisfaction.  Those are microwave popcorn and grilled cheese.I didn't have the door open button issue that some people mentioned.I will update this after I've used this longer.
3,The product was damaged and wouldn’t even turn on. The door was bent and the packaging/ styrofoam was in pieces surrounding the oven in the box.
5,"Needed a small, white microwave. It fits under my cabinet nicely. Small footprint. Functional for all my needs. Arrived quickly, packaged well, no damage. Recommend."
5,So far this microwave fits exactly what we were looking for. It has enough power and interior space and the controls are relatively easy to see and simple to use. I especially like the handle since many microwaves now have just a button and some of those you need to push on ONE SIDE of the button to get the thing to open. The handle eliminates that concern.Very pleased with this so far.
2,A little disappointed.Pros - door has a handle rather than push buttonmakes large bag of popcorn perfectlyCons - Unable to use the timer and cook features at the same timeThe done cooking chime does not stop when the door is openedVERY noisy!Can't see very well through the doorCooks much slower than the 1100 Watt microwave we used to have (maybe the 100 watts makes a big difference?)
4,Great little oven. Bought it to use while our kitchen remodel was in progress.  It was a lifesaver.  Adequate power and room inside for afull sized dinner plate.  My grandson has claimed it now that the remodel project is finished.  I didn't give it five stars as the controls werenot as well laid out as they could have been...a minor issue.
2,"About a year and a half after purchase, this microwave oven started heating unreliably. When new, it took 1 minute to get a mug of water hot. In about a year and a half, I noticed that, sometimes, the heating was incomplete. The fan pitch would speed up after about a half minute of heating and, at the end, the mug came out warm and had to be microwaved for as much as another full minute. This started happening more and more often but it wasn't consistent, making accurate food preparation iffy."
1,"I would push the start button, then its power stopped and also tripped the circuit and all nearby circuits on my kitchen island. I had to flip the breaker switches at the power box to restore power to those sockets.It happened again a few weeks later, and then the sockets stopped working completely! Flipping the breaker switches doesn’t reset them anymore and now I’m without electricity on my kitchen island. Thanks Black and Decker…"
1,It leaks after you use the microwave.
5,I have gray/granite colored appliances and the coloring of this unit works well. The clock shines bright. Easy to use and heats food evenly. I’m happy with this purchase.
1,"Item arrivés in perfecto cosmetic conditions, however no matter what it won't heat up."
3,"The interior light never worked. Reordered. Just received today; light works. Hopefully, everything else is okay with this one."
1,Didn't work from out of the box!!Sent it back and luckily got my money back!!
4,"First, make sure you note the differences between the available options, they are two different microwaves, not just different sizes. The one that seems smaller is actually a larger appliance physically. I was disappointed when it arrived and didn't have the Melt/Soften feature that I was planning on, that's when I realized they were different models.The first feature that I don't like is that the chime (they call it a ""Bee"" in the instructions because of, you know, proofreading English) only sounds once. Unlike other microwaves that chime multiple times, or even continue to chime if you've left something in, you only get one shot to hear that it's done. This is the same for the Kitchen Alarm feature, so it's incredibly risky.The second and most annoying feature is that the Cook Time and the Set Clock buttons are the same button. You push the button once if you want to set the clock and twice if you want to set how much time to cook.  How does that make any sense? They have literally used the same button for the most and probably least used features on the microwave. You set the time maybe twice a year, but you set cook times multiple times each day. The result, especially if you have kids is that there's a lot of clock setting going on. It is for this reason that I'm not giving this five stars, and had I known I would have potentially considered another microwave."
3,"The performance of this microwave oven was great for 34 months, but now the fan and turntable keep running when the door is opened, instead of automatically shutting off.  If cost of repair at local appliance shop is too expensive, I will need to get a new one. The problem is so many appliances seem to have short lifespans these days."
5,This little microwave is compact and extremely effective. It does everything we've come to expect from a microwave. It is on the smaller side but big enough to take care of most everything we've ever needed for a microwave. Such as corn dogs and heating coffee and all the rest. I love it! And it was so affordable which really helps. I don't have a lot of counter space so the size was perfect for our family and if you're looking for an economic microwave -- this is the one for you.
5,We have been using this often for close to 5 months now.  No issues at all!  Works as expected.
4,"This things can do anything! Except fit in small spaces…. It’s absolutely massive. Definitely not meant for countertops.  But again, it’s everything all in one."
4,Great small size but lacking in power. What used to heat up in 2 minutes in a bigger unit now takes 5.
3,I would give this 5 stars all the way but I can’t.  We had to replace our kitchen cabinets and decided to purchase this to be placed in an appliance cabinet.  The specs say it is 16” deep. There is a diagram that shows a required space behind and above the unit. We finally got our cabinets installed and placed this unit in the cabinet. Including the handle it did not fit inside our 18” cabinet. Very disappointed because it is a very nice microwave. Our time expired for returns so now we have a unit we cannot use.
2,"I bought this in July of this year.  About a month later the thin plastic that covers the start button started to blister and now the cook time button is also blistering. It doesn't affect the function but is ugly. When I called GE I was told it was a ""cosmetic issue"" and isn't covered under warranty. Won't be buying anything GE from now on."
3,Would be a great microwave except that the glass dish NEVER stays in place! Considering my microwave is up on a shelf it’s a super pain to have to drag out the step ladder to reposition the glass dish (and rollers) only to have it come out of place again the very next time. Beyond aggravating.
3,It's a nice little microwave the does the job but is a bit on the loud size especially considering its small size.
3,"Received the oven on time and in good condition.  The look and feel of it are very good and fits in with our kitchen appliances.  I gave this a three star rating for performance issues, but none are areas that are ""out of spec"" or considered returnable for non performance reasons per advertisement and user manual specs.  What we noticed are three areas of concern. First was noise when power cooking was on. When it starts up we hear a louder than last unit it replaced, transformer ""hum"" that gets even louder as when the microwave-tube inside turns on and off to heat the food.  Along with the metal enclosure of the unit that amplifies the inside transformer hum sound that it creates. Second, and at first we didn't think this was a big deal but turns out it is an inconvenience,  is the position of the cup, bowel, plate it stops at when the heating is done.  Our last unit 90 % of the time stopped it in the same direction you placed it in at startup.  This is so helpful if you are heating up coffee or soup or anything that has handles so you can grab it right up front opening the door.  I thought they all did that anyway but was wrong with this unit and is frustrating when retrieving your heated item as it many stop in the back end of the oven and you end up having to reach all the way in to remove it.  We also noticed the total power of 1000 watts should be better than our 900 watt old unit, but indeed it takes longer an average of 35% more time to heat up the same item.  Meaning more power to do the same job and I am sure that equals to more energy used that costs more to run the unit $$.  It is taking us some time to get use to it and we understand that.  We are not sure if we want to return it yet.  We are use to a much quieter unit having coffee in the morning at the table. We will contact the manufacture but I don't think they will do much for us as I said it may be performing per their spec.  We just don't know, and a microwave unit going back will cost almost half of the unit cost for shipping.  Go figure!  So it is a 3 star unit for us.  We have had very good luck with items from Amazon so not sure what we will do."
2,"ONLY LASTED 22 MO. LIGHT USE. 2 MIN./DAY 5 DAYS A WEEK. REPAIR COST $180,MORE THAN ORIGINAL COST. PAID $20 FOR ESTIMATE, AND $20 RECYCLE. NEVER MOVED FROM ORIGINAL PLACEMENT."
2,"So far, I’ve not been very satisfied with the air fryer function…one of the reasons I purchased was so I wouldn’t have so many appliances taking up counter space…did chicken legs using an air fryer recipe…cooked twice as long as recipe indicated and legs still weren’t done…ended up throwing out…next tried air fried potatoes…sliced small and of equal size and again, after cooking twice as long, not all pieces were tender…very disappointed."
1,"Yes, it’s very small and it’s keep sparking burning my food"
1,The turning plate inside comes off the track and won’t stay where it’s supposed to. Has done it since day one. Unfortunately we have already gotten rid of the box so we can’t return it.
3,"The turn table messes up, the inside is so small a bag of popcorn wont rotate. This microwave isnt even worth the money it costed. The power of it is minimal everything needs warmed up even longer than normal. Popcorn doestn rotate well and to cool it thoroughly you need to push popcorn button 2-3x"
5,"It’s been a few years, and it still works fine."
1,"This microwave has one serious design flaw that baffles me every time I use it. The “Change Clock” and “Cook Time” button are the same button. Normally this wouldn’t be a big deal, but to change the clock, you press it once…to set your cook time, you press it twice.That’s right…it’s one press for the feature you’ll use twice a year (change your clock) and 2 presses for the feature you’ll use EVERY TIME YOU USE THE MICROWAVE (set your cook time).This makes this microwave super annoying, and makes us accidentally change the clock daily. What the hell were they thinking when they designed it this way?"
4,"Small enough, but powerful enough. Took me a while to get used to the controls but it works great!"
3,The turn table roller came broke in a double boxed container. The boxes were not damaged on the outside telling me it was broken when manufacture packaged it.
1,"I just moved into a one room apartment and needed a new microwave so I thought this might've been what I needed but when I got it it takes up like a third of my kitchen shelf space and sounds so loud I could hear it out in the hallway. Already considering a replacementEdit: it's so weak and small I couldn't even put a frozen tv dinner in it without it trying as hard as it can to spin it, only to have it get stuck on the walls because it can barely fit a bowl in it."
4,"WE LOVED THIS FABERWARE.  ONLY PROBLEM FOR US WAS IT WAS ONLY 1000 WATTS AND WE DIDNT NOTICE IT AT THE TIME THAT WE BOUGHT IT.  THIS  MICROWAVE  WAS QUIET, & HAD MANY OF THE FEATURES THAT OUR OLD BIG (SEARS) MICROWAVE HAD.  SAME SOUND CLOSING THE DOOR, SAME BEEPING SOUND (5) TIMES, AND ETC. THIS ONE HAD ONE MORE STEP BEFORE STARTING.  WE GAVE IT A 4 STAR BECAUSE OF THE WATTS.  WE WERE LOOKING FOR A WICROWAVE THAT WOULD HEAT FOOD AND COOK FROZEN DINNERS.  ALMOST ALL OF THE  FROZEN DINNERS CALL FOR 1100 WATS SO WE BOUGHT THE FABERWARE PROFESSIONAL FMO13AHTPLE 1.3 CUBIC 1100 WATS.  WE LOVE THAT ONE ALSO. GREAT ITEM FOR A GREAT PRICE."
5,"I am learning to use all the features, but live the microwave/ air fryer/ convection oven."
5,"Works like a charm.  My prior microwave lasted 17 years.  The next one I got (before this one) arrived broken so ordered this one.  Should have gotten this one first.  (Hope by posting this review I have not triggered a cascade of failure) (Yeah, I know that's impossible)(is just a set of circumstances that seem linked)(but...)  Anyway...  IT WORKS.  Stuff gets heated right.It's a bit noisy when I shut the door but I can live with that. Nowhere near as loud as most restaurants these days.One aspect I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE Designers/MFG in the Microwave Clone Factory do is:  >>> MAKE THE KEYPADS of the future machines WHITE or Silver but not BLACK.  Black absorbs light and it is nearly impossible to see the numbers and labels.Regardless of the amount of light in the kitchen there is an issue.  Not just with this 'Brand' 'Style' either.  I've seen Microwaves at friend's homes and they have the same problem.  Not enough light and it needs a  flashlight.  TOO MUCH LIGHT and the keypad reflects so still cant read the numbers etc.Other than that - great for the price.  No bells, whistles etc.  It just works."
3,"This microwave is similar to the older one we had, so easy to use.  But the motor makes a lot more noise, especially when it first starts."
5,The door is noisy no matter how how easy you close it
5,It works fine!
5,"It is the perfect size for the counter. I love the fact that I'm able to airfryer, convection oven, and microwave! I wish I had this a couple years ago!The buttons do not light up but that is only a minor issue. This was well worth the money and I would recommend buying it."
4,"The  control panel buttons are hard to push.Keep trying until you find a""sweet spot"",then everything elseworks fine."
4,So this is small and I have found the wattage is probably not very high comparing it to my other microwave. But it is perfect for small spaces and gets the job done. Hoping it lasts
2,"We've had this microwave for about a yr & a half. Bought it because it was this right size for the space.  Two problems. 1st, it is very light weight and slides backward constantly.  Worse, it is super hard to open. You push a button to release the latch. That was stiff but ok for a few months. But now it takes two hands- one to very slightly lift the door while pushing the button with the other. The door ever so slightly sags and causes the latch to bind.  Not good."
1,"My microwave of one 15 years started to go on the fritz out of no where so I decided to ""upgrade"" with this pos. Food does NOT cook evenly.. no matter how I arrange it there a big difference in the donness of what comes out. Cooking 3 hotdogs? Well prepare 1 to be split from end to end before the other 2 are done to any satisfaction... Oh.. and it burns my popcorn! Smart sensors be damned.. even if I put in a 3oz bag on the 2.75oz setting I still get burnt popcorn. My 15+ year old microwave never had a problem.. hell it didn't care how big the bag was.. you hit popcorn and you got perfectly cooked popcorn... Such a huge disappointment..Pros..- I won't have to clean my microwave for a little while- wifi means that I never have to set the clock- compatible with Alexa so I can just say ""Alexa burn my popcorn"" and she will gladly comply- I was able to tell the old lady that I spent $180 on it and was about to take the other 40 and buy something to doesn't actually suckCons..- i now have to determine the exact time for every type of popcorn bag my old lady decides to buy that week- smart sensors be damned.. evening is too hot and to cold at the same time"
4,Bought it for a housewarming party nice but too small
3,It works fine there's no problems that way. It just that the interior is too small for my big hands.
1,"Purchased this item seven months ago. Last week I was using the convection oven when my smoke alarm went off. I ran to the kitchen to find thick black smoke billowing from the appliance. After cleaning the plastic ring and waveguide cover were still discolored and the smell of smoke remained strong particularly in the back vent area. Called Toshiba customer service;  the rep went through a long list of possible causes, none of which seemed to apply. Nevertheless, the only advice provided was to operate the oven again and see what happened. I asked if I could use the one year warranty to have the unit checked for a possible  product defect and was told they don't provide that kind of servicing. As I would not feel comfortable continuing to use it without knowing why the incident occurred, will discard it instead."
1,Didn't even last 6 months.  Garbage
5,"Great microwave. I've had it for about a month now and I am very happy with it. it is a low wattage, takes a bit longer than my old microwave to heat up food, but it heats things up evenly. no burned spots.  would recommend for the price and it looks great."
1,This microwave is NO longer working!!Exterior seems to over heat but the FOOD does NOT!
1,I was very disappointed with the product because the handle came off the first day I used it.  I wanted to exchange the item but that was not an option.  When I looked at the item to reorder it was  a higher price.  I did not understand why I wasn't  able to exchange for the same price.
4,"This FARBERWARE PROFESSIONAL 1.3 CUBIC FOOT 1100-WATT MICROWAVE OVEN WITH SENSOR COOKING (FMO13AHTPLE; White/Platinum) is a compact, powerful, no-nonsense microwave oven.  It delivers good value for the price (about $150 on Amazon) because 1100 watts will cook everything fast, and you won't need additional cooking time when you're following microwave recipes.  I love the 1100 watts, because my previous microwave was a slightly underpowered 900 watts.The microwave will do two-step microwaving (for example, 5 minutes on 90% power followed by 3 minutes on 50% power), though it does NOT have a built-in automatic pause between the steps (for stirring an entree or adding ingredients).  I miss this feature, which was on my three previous microwaves, but I like how easy it is to set up the two-step procedure on this microwaves.The microwave has a handy “express cooking” feature that allows you to press 1, 2, or 3 on the keypad (when the clock display is showing), to cook for 1, 2, or 3 minutes.  (The clock display indicates “waiting mode”; and a short button press (the Stop button) turns the display off for “energy saving mode”.)The microwave can of course be set for any desired cooking time, using the “Cook Time” button and the keypad. When the microwave is finished cooking, it beeps just once.  There is no irritating reminder beep, although I sort of miss this feature, too.The worst feature of this great family-sized microwave is the manual, which appears to be written by someone for whom English is a second language.  Simple terms like “waiting mode” are NOT defined, and the step-by-step instructions are hard to understand unless you're already familiar with microwave ovens.  The instructions for “sensor cooking” are totally opaque--so that I will have to learn to use the Sensor buttons (pizza, entree, etc.) by trial and error.This is a countertop microwave.  The manual cautions against installing it above a stovetop or anything that produces heat."
1,ZERO Stars.  Panasonic has been making microwave ovens forever so you would think they know how to make a door that actually opens and closes.  NO!  They've come up with a Rube Goldberg (no offense to Mr. Goldberg) and cheap door opening gizmo that doesn't work.  Door sticks miserably.  I've tried the Panasonic recommendation of lubricating the mechanism -- tried several different lubricants including the recommended lithium grease.  No luck.  It may open and close just fine for awhile but then it will suddenly start sticking again.  Purchase at your own risk.  Also please understand that Panasonic service centers are few and far between.  Mailing in the unit for them to just grease the door and send it back is not worth it.  Panasonic has lost my business for microwave ovens FOREVER.
4,"The microwave part of this works well. Just about as well as my new Panasonic. It has thaw and sensor options and the now standard turn table. It gets the job done. It was packed well and set up is a breeze. It does need grippier bottom though as it slides a bit.However, this microwave has what is potentially a revolutionary grill function! That is pretty friggin awesome, right? It is certainly not a feature I've ever come across in a microwave... lets read all about it! Well thats not going to happen. The instructions are a joke. They make ikea instructions seem like an illuminated manuscript or classic literature. I can't tell you the last time I had any cause or reason to look at a microwave instruction manual... but when it contains a brand new feature you need to know about you expect there to be something. It is more or less just what you read on the webpage. Ive tried it a couple times and still haven't quite figured it out. I believe it to be some sort of heat induction type thing like many stoves use but that is just my best guess. So far I've made great hot dogs, an ok burger, and a very dried out pork chop. I have emailed the company for a better understanding of grill feature but nothing yet.For a company that I didn't even know made microwaves to launch a feature I didn't know could exist in a microwave, let alone know quite how to use, seems like a major oversight. The microwave features are all straight forward and easy to use, so I hope in the future they add a little info card or something similar on grill uses, an explanation of how it works, some recipes or what have you."
2,"Overall, just don't.  We have had ours less than 6 months. Makes weird noises, lightning, and doesn't spin correctly. Most things burnt or half frozen.Cats like it.I like how it looks...super snazzy."
1,"Bought GE mostly because we prefer the controls. Main use is making popcorn with Orville Redenbacher Presto Power Cup popper. Other microwaves take about 2 minutes and pop full. In this microwave, it takes 2:45 and it only pops 3/4 of the kernels. And the microwave gets too hot and beeps meanly at you. Perhaps it doesn't like the popper base. Not sure, but I don't like it when my microwave talks back."
2,"This broke in less than a month that I was using it, small & cheap. Not worth the $$"
4,All functions work well. The drawbacks are the beeping sound after a round and the door opening and closing sound are too loud.
4,"I was looking for an inverter style microwave that was powerful, feature rich, and did it's job. This hit on all of those points and except for one flaw would be a perfect 10/10.Pros:- Microwaves food well. I know this should be obvious but with some of the reviews I'd read I thought I should make this clear. It does its job well with no uneven heating.- Sense reheat works awesome. Coming from a microwave that didn't have this feature, this makes warming up food easy. No more guess work or babysitting the food while it reheats. Put it in, press Sense Reheat, start it and walk away. You'll come back to fully warmed up food. It errors on the side of too warm than too cold so you don't have to worry about those odd cold bites. Just be sure not to cover it.- Cleans super easy. Whatever material or coating they are using is perfect for wiping out any mess. Compared to my old microwave this is world's better. You won't realize how awesome this is until you try wiping dry spaghetti sauce from the top of a microwave. I could never go back one without this coating.- Ability to turn off sound. As someone who has a toddler who naps/sleeps in the room next to the kitchen this is a huge feature for me. No more loud beeps whenever you're pressing buttons and no more alarm going off whenever it's done.- Build quality feels solid and I have no worries about its longevity. This wasn't the cheapest microwave but it feels like it hit the sweet spot between features and quality. You could spend a lot more on a microwave that wouldn't work any better.So with all these positives what is the flaw that single handedly takes an entire star off the rating?The most annoying flaw:After heating something up and checking it, if you need to add additional time you can't just press the number keys. Your options are, use the 30 second button to add time in 30 second blocks, press the add time button then hit the number keys, press clear then hit the number keys, or wait 1 minute for it to lose its memory and then press the number keys.Now let me be clear, I understand why they have the additional time button. It's so you can add time without having to go through re-entering all those additional settings again. But the amount of times I actually use the advanced heating options vs just throwing food in there and hitting it full blast aren't even close. I've had this microwave for 2 months and I haven't once set the power level or used it to make dough or bake a cake or any ofhat other stuff.But you know what I do basically every single day? Throw my kids food in there and then have to keep checking it to make sure it's not too hot then adding more time. And every single time I run it for 10 seconds then have to check it, when I need to add more time guess what? I can't just press the number keys and hit go. I've got to hit additional time then 10 seconds.Doesn't sound like a big deal right? It only adds an extra second of time. Sure, you're right, except I've got 20+ years of microwave muscle memory built in telling me once you open the door to check the food you can go right back to pressing the number keys and hitting go. So every time I use it I naturally close the door and then go right to pressing numbers only to remember, ""oh that's right they've added an additional extra unnecessary step before allowing me to add additional time"".I don't care about giving us an extra minute of time after heating up food to decide if we want those same settings and to add additional time. I want to check my food, press numbers, and hit start.I'm sure some engineer got paid a lot of money to add more features to a microwave that wasn't needed simply to check off something on a checklist somewhere but they sacrificed flow of use for it.Yes it's a minor thing. Yes it doesn't take away from the overall product. Yes it still pisses me off every time I need to add an extra 10 seconds to something. Yes I'm removing an entire star because of this."
3,"As microwaves go, it functions as you'd expect.  My complains are with the insensitivity of the membrane covering the buttons and how difficult it can be to actuate the button.  There's also the noise, I never expected it to be as loud.  It's possible that my placement with the rear against a half wall is amplifying the noise, but not that much.  I will say it's easy to clean."
4,"My biggest constraint was the depth from the back wall, because my enclosed cabinet is shallow--all fine there, as advertised.  Number two concern was the ability to get an 11-inch dinner plate through the door.  Unfortunately, despite the interior dimensions given, the door is only 10-7/8 inches wide, so I have to tilt my 11-inch plates about 10 degrees.  That's not bad if there's nothing too liquid on them.  Once you get through the door, there's extra space.  Otherwise very nice, easy to operate and very easy to clean, with smooth rounded inside corners without seams to trap crud or corrosion."
4,"This little microwave has been perfect. My only complaint is that you can't see the food cooking, as the window has a reflective, mirror-like quality to it. It's also a little loud, but it works perfectly for us."
4,Works well. Voltage is less than we're used to. But works well
2,"We recently downsized into an apartment so, needed a smaller microwave! This particular model was just what we were looking for...color, size and wattage. The heating capacity works well, the style and color(black and stainless) looks great on a brand new cart. HOWEVER, the buzzing that has started(purchased 10-19-2020) sounds as though it could crap out at any moment!!!😡 Never in my life, have I EVER had to write a review on an appliance that is ONLY two months old!!! This is unfortunate and it appears that others have the same issues???? REALLY??? Also, it appears that the CUSTOMER SERVICE IS JUST AS BAD!!! Personally, a recall should be in the works for the MANY UNHAPPY CONSUMERS who are in the same boat as we are!!! NOT HAPPY 😡😡😡😡"
1,"The plate and the ring do not fit; the three prongs that are cut into the plate are nowhere near where the prongs are inside of the microwave. It's as if someone cut the plate 3 prongs in the center but the prongs inside the oven are to the left or right and therefore the plate spins half off of the ring, causing whatever you are heating to constantly make a bump bump sound because it is uneven. I am so unhappy with it; everything is sloshing around;"
1,broke after 4 months. went through trouble shooting. still not working. amazon and farberware are no help as it should be covered at least by a 1 year manufacturer warranty.
5,"Awesome microwave for compact size, features,  cool time, ease of use, and price.  I bought a 2nd one after I liked the first so much."
3,"I have had this only 3 years and have to replace it. The sensor malfunctioned and does not totally turn off!! When I open the door to place an item inside to cook it automatically starts by itself cooking and rotating!! A fire hazard!!I unplugged it numerous times and left it unplugged for hours and then for 2 days and still not working properly. I also hit the stop button numerous times before setting cook time in hopes it would help. Nope not work.  So throwing away. Too dangerous to keep. It should last longer than 3 years with casual use.And yes it does rust also as other users have said. I had water run out of mine at different times and it was not from the interior, but from the bottom where holes are to cool it. Scary on that thought also and not safe!! I started leaving the door cracked over night to help with any built up moisture issues.Love the size and way it cooks. Not noisey and easy to use and clean.  However with the short life and running by itself and moisture issues I can not recommend it. : ( Potential fire hazard and shock hazard. I hope they update it and address the problems."
5,"Works great so far. I have not owned or used a microwave for several years, so I am not sure if it heats the same as a regular microwave but it does within 2 minutes which is fine for me. It is small and compact but still fits my larger dinner plates."
4,easy to unbox & get to work
3,Not very powerful. its ok for low usage or a convenience microwave
5,This Black and Decker .9 cu ft. and 900 Watts of power is a great back up to our over the range larger micro on back order until it arrives whenever.  So far so good as expected from black and decker products. Happy
2,"We've had this microwave for almost three years, very disappointing.  It stopped working, the light turns on and it sounds like it is working but when you take out the item you want heated it's the same as it was first put in the microwave.  We've had microwaves that have lasted longer than this."
5,"It’s a perfect little microwave for my small space. Easy buttons, nothing complicated. Lightweight. The heating time seems true to previous microwaves. Would recommend!"
5,Very easy to read large display and durable key pad.  This gets a workout and is easy . We enjoy the quick set and go reheat and sensor functions best on the market from our experience.  The power and cubic cooking space is excellant for small or large batch steaming and cookingor thawing.
4,functions well for price point. wish it had a beep silencer.  I prefer them not to beep.
4,"This microwave unit is approximately half the size of the monstrous unit I owned previously, yet still holds a full size dinner plate inside.  I do notice the power is a bit lower than I am used to; someitmes within 30-45 seconds in cook time or sometimes a minute or more, depending on if item was frozen or merley needed reheating.  I thought I would miss the number keypad but the dial adjustments are super convenient. A huge plus is this unit is so quiet! The color matches my other appliances and it is a nice microwave that is easy to use."
1,"Smaller than it appears and fits very few things. Takes forever to heat up anything.Over time it builds up moisture. The walls are always wet, there is standing water under the turntable.  All this causes bacteria and mold growth and bad smell. Surprisingly bad microwave."
3,"My microwave came to me dented. Was wanting my product damage free.Not happy that i might have to send it back to get a replacement, if it doesn't work!!"
5,"I had a Panasonic with inverter for about four years. One day, it just died. I use my microwave all the time, so this was a problem. I wanted one with the same wattage and inside space. I found this one and really liked it, but it was sold out. When I looked for it elsewhere on the web, it was sold out everywhere. Bad sign. Maybe it's being discontinued. So, I ordered the last used/like new. So glad I did! I love this microwave! Compared to my old one, it is very quiet. Having to press ""cook time"" instead of just pushing the numbers takes some getting used to. But, once you do, it's fine. It's nice that pressing 1 through 6 starts and runs the microwave for the corresponding number of minutes. Like others have said, the control panel is off a bit. I have to touch the buttons higher than the center. But, once used to it, it's not a big deal. I do a lot of baking and really like the setting to soften butter. That same button can be used to soften or melt other things as well. As unimportant as it is, I really do like that when I reheat my cup of coffee, this microwave returns the handle to its starting position. There are lots of other features that I haven't even tried yet. Overall, this is a great microwave. If you can still get one, buy it."

5,Love itb
4,"This is a rebrand from the same manufacturer that makes the popular Hamilton Beach 0.7 cu ft model sold by Walmart., and also the Mainstays brand. All these cheap appliances come from the same factories people. They just change the handle, color, or keypad, the internals are the same. I knowingly paid a large markup for this rebrand because it comes with the upgraded keypad with the option to silence the keys and alert after cooking. You press and hold button 8 and it stops both the beeps when you push buttons and also the beeps after cooking.Pros:Silence the beeps once and for all!Small/compactSturdy turntable glassCons:Overpriced given that other nearly identical rebrands sell for $42-$45 when not on saleThe door and door latching pieces are a bit cheap, which makes them more work and louder than necessary. Also would prefer a traditional handle but those are pretty much non-existent on 0.7 cu ft ovens.The exterior could be more solid. I happened to put a little weight on it without thinking and I thought it would cave in...Not sure how evenly it cooks yet, will keep testingBTW, for your electrical safety, you need to be aware that while the oven outputs 700 watts, the input is a little over 1000 watts. So, like with a space heater, this appliance alone can come close to maxing out the circuit either on your power strip, surge protector, or the home circuit itself. Most modern circuits max out at 15 amps and either 1500 or 1800 watts, but if you are using cheap power strips you could be limiting yourself to less than that and could start a fire, especially if other devices are running when you are using the microwave."
1,It was shipped with a dent on the top of it.
2,Instruction book lacking
5,"11/10 'Murrka size...  Try getting stuck in a corner now, full size bag of microwavable popcorn!  (Yes, that's a full size/3.5 ounce bag of popcorn in the picture).  Hail to the king!"
2,"Upon plugging in and closing the door of the first unit we received, we found the turntable started and ran continuously.  Farberware Support instructed  us to return it to Amazon.  We received a replacement in 2 or 3 days.  We found the turntable rotates with several slight hesitations in each revolution but have elected to keep it.  We needed a compact, 1100 watt unit and, in terms of design, this is what we were seeking.  The characters and buttons on the control panel are rather small and I can visualize some seniors  having to don their reading glasses.  Otherwise, it's a microwave, but one whose reliability is a question mark."
2,"This is generally speaking a nice microwave. The buttons are not very intuitive but you can learn them.The reason I am writing now is that yesterday, I smelled smoke, looked inside and saw dark gray smoke. Forgot about it and heated my lunch today. Same thing. It was/is not coming from anything being heated inside. Smells like insulation being burned by electrical wires.--So I have to start the process of dealing with it. Should be in warranty.Plan to provide followup on here later."
3,The protective coating on the menu wore off in the first 30 days. The inside tray and guide don't fit right.
2,"I bought this microwave on Amazon 2 years ago after my mom bought the same from Best Buy. I bought it to replace another similarly sized/same wattage white microwave I had that was 10 years old and still worked fine but ""looked"" old. This microwave was significantly less powerful than my old one straight out of the box. I thought maybe I had gotten lemon because the clock and timer, etc. worked, it's just that it required more time for everything than my old one.  About six months ago I mentioned this to my mom when I was using her microwave and it also TOOK FOREVER to heat everything. she said it had always been that way. So it isn't that mine was a lemon. This particular GE countertop microwave does NOT heat effectively. I would not buy it again and if I come across a similarly-sized 700W or higher model of another brand I will retire this one straight to the junkyard--I won't even give it away. It is THAT slow to heat. :("
1,I disliked that it broke within 3 weeks
3,"Not impressed. Oh, it works, but no bells and whistles. Basic. You get what you pay for."
1,"TERRIBLE. Box damaged. Looks like this microwave was returned and re- packaged to be sent to next customer. Microwave was dented, in several areas- Also. Display panel broken.  Not ordering from Black and Decter again"
2,Worked great - until it completely stopped working after 3 years
5,"We got a microwave hutch to give us more counter space. The microwave we had was too big though and hung off.We bought this microwave and it has been great. It doesn’t fit more than a regular dinner plate, but that’s okay.It fits in the space and it functions well."
3,"Had this microwave for exactly 6 months and 3 days. It started making a loud noise when heating then just stopped heating.  The turntable turns, the clock works, but the microwave doesn't heat.  Amazon will not take it back and Farberware isn't open on the weekends.  It's heavy and we're old.  I'm not happy with either Farberware or Amazon.FYI:  Farberware microwaves are NOT manufactured by Farberware, rather Edge.HOWEVER UPDATE:  Amazon came through.  When I could not reach EDGE, Amazon allowed me to return it.  Love you Amazon!"
5,"I was looking for a purely white microwave, but everything in trending toward stainless steel. I purchased this one because it had some white on the front and it also has a cool memory feature. I want a microwave that has a one-touch button for 45 seconds but they don't exist. With the memory feature, I can set a cook time program for 45 seconds. It's almost as many buttons to push....but I still liked that it had that feature. This microwave works well. The light inside is bright and shows the food while cooking better than my old microwave did. It does show fingerprints on the stainless steel part, a little. Overall, I'm glad I purchased this model."
3,"Seems to be fine as a general microwave but everyone has issues with the Alexa controls.Long boring tech talk short, this is due to Toshibas horrible decision to partner with Midea Manufacturing and their shoddy development and app management for the voice controls.Don't follow the user manual where it says to install the iMicrowave skill from Toshiba themselves for Alexa. Instead install the mSmart Skill from Midea, that skill links to the mSmart App and works. It may show errors on the app but voice control works. A bit flaky at times but way better than no function at all.Hope this helps."
5,It’s easy to use . The handles are easy to read and read
1,"I just received this yesterday and to my disappointment, it has no popcorn setting.  The control panel is so strange, no one can operate it without the manual.  For pop corn you have to press the auto button 6 times.  It's easier to just enter the cook time.  Did I say ""press""?  You have to jab hard to ""press"" any button!  Also, the control panel is so small and dim we had to use a flashlight to read it.  I am going to use it a few more times, but looks like it is going to have to go back.  I don't think I can operate it.  One more thing:  The manual is written in such poor English it is difficult to understand."
4,"My microwave broke so I decided to buy this one in the meantime until I had the money to fix or buy a new model of the other one, which is more expensive because it hangs above is stove and has to match the rest of the decor. So I figured this one would do. I was correct.The only reason that I give it a four star rating instead of five stars is because the quick Express settings aren't as easy to use as the more modern microwaves that I have had in the last couple of years. Other than that, it is great.Be careful, it warms up food faster than you would think. It is very powerful. I really like this and feel like it is well worth the money."
5,"It was a bit larger than my last one, but I love this brand. Was delivered quickly as promised. It performes well. Same functions as the last one which I wanted. The last one lasted for years..."
4,"See photo- box was delivered with obvious damage- when unpacked there were 7 dents. I contacted Amazon and their cust service rep emailed me a return label and shipped a new unit which arrived without any damage in about 48 hours. I was pleased with how they handled the exchange. Jury is still out on how well I like the new unit, however all looks well and it appears fully functional. I will likely review performance after I have used it a while.After several uses, I have found that it emits a ""strong electrical odor"" which may be temporary and go away with time (after unit goes through ""break in"" period). Will see how this goes over the comming weeks."
1,Stopped working after 45 days.  Didn’t heat up food and had a burning smell. I wouldn’t recommend this product.
4,"We are downsizing, so we bought a smaller microwave. But it's not powerful. It takes about 50% more time to cook/heat up the food, so it takes some time to get used to it. Other than that, it is just another microwave."
5,Doesn't take up much room but performs like a bigger microwave. Just great.
3,Works great the only thing is that it is loud when in use but I am satisfied
3,"Even trying it empty the first time it emitted a strange odor. Very distinctive but hard to identify. Has continued after multiple uses. I have cleaned it thoroughly looking for a source with no luck. It is an odd chemical odor. Considered returning, but keep hoping it will go away"
5,"This is the best little microwave and fits perfectly on my counter without looking like the huge, white elephant in the room.  The features are plenty and you will love it!  Good brand, good quality!!  Order it up now!!"
1,"The microwave arrived in good shape, no damage to the box or machine, but unfortunately it did not heat food, nor did the plate spin. I had to return it and decided not to try to order another microwave to be delivered."
4,Smaller than expected. Works good tho
3,It's a normal microwave. Not special
4,"The door is a like noisier than I prefer, but it's a good microwave."
3,"This review is for the NN-SN67KS.  I was on the fence based on some of the reviews, but had to see for myself whether or not such a highly rated microwave was worth the trade-offs, price premium, and risk of failures.  Was the inverter technology so life changing that I could put up with some of the negative points others brought up?  Were the concerns even real?  Here’s what I found.2.4GHz wifi interference:  I was a bit skeptical, thinking there must have been something unique about the situations of reviewers that reported loss of wi-fi signal while this microwave was operating.  Well, sure enough, while the microwave was running, here are some things I noticed. 1) my wireless IP security camera lost signal; 2) the video streaming to my google Chromecast got pixelated then paused and buffered; and 3) our wireless baby monitor (not network connected) lost signal.  To be clear, these devices mentioned were all wirelessly connected via 2.4GHz.  All devices that were connected via 5GHz (phone, iPad, etc.) were not affected at all.  I can see this not being an issue at all If you only use fairly new devices and phones.Clock button:  A couple users complained of having to set/re-enter the time every time they accidentally pressed the ‘clock’ button.  Apparently, it was too easy to accidental hit the ‘clock’ button since it was right next to the ‘0’.  This is a non-issue.  If you accidentally hit the ‘clock’ button, you don’t have to re-enter the time.  Just press ‘stop/reset’ button.  This will cancel it and the time will show up again.Beep:  It’s all perspective, but in my opinion, this had the least obtrusive and lowest volume “done cooking” beeps of all the microwaves I've ever heard.  5 short beeps.  (long beeps always sound like they’re yelling at me).  Note that opening the door will not stop the beeping.  If you really wanted to, you can turn off all beeping sounds coming from this microwave, but you can only access this option when you first plug it in (or you can unplug and re-plug it in).  Without pressing any other buttons first, press the ‘start’ button twice to access the option.  Then the ‘timer’ button will allow you to cycle between on and off.  Pg 11 of the manual covers this.  Note that this will turn off all beeps including button presses.Light:  In my opinion, it is on the dim side.  The light itself is decently bright, but the problem is that it doesn’t cast a wide beam and there are defined shadowed sections where the light doesn’t hit.  And while the dark grey interior gives it a modern look, it doesn’t reflect light like the more common white interiors, which makes matters worse.  Not a deal breaker alone, but something that I had to get used to.Keypad buttons:  - I found that this unit require noticeably harder keypad button presses.  Coming from a unit with a more responsive keypad, it was a slight annoyance to have to pay attention to whether the keypress registered and whether I needed to shift my finger slightly or press harder.Other thoughts:-  Of all the microwaves I’ve owned, this required the lightest touch to close the door.  It follows that it also had the quietest latching sound.  Overall, the mechanical build quality is top notch.- No one button start.  Even the ‘Quick 30s’ button requires you to press the ‘start’ button.  This was a big negative for me having come from a microwave that had one button start for 30sec as well as 1-6 minute cook times.  But I knew this going in and thought it might be a small price to pay to have the inverter experience.-  No flat plug.  I used a 1ft flat plug “extension” cord since I needed it to sit against the wall with an outlet behind it.  I posted a pic of the space behind the microwave.  There are plastic standoffs that space the microwave a bit from the wall, but there’s zero chance the included straight plug will fit.-  Another thing I noticed is that porcelain dinner plates and plastic splatter covers got much hotter (with the same temperature food) than with my previous microwave.  I suspect this is related to the inverter technology.  The thermal images in their marketing product pictures also seem to show a higher temperature mug, so probably not just my imagination.After 3 weeks of wanting to love it, ultimately, I ended up returning the unit.  The little compromises just added up to be too much to put up with.  After having to give up one button start, the additional trade offs of 1) the wifi interference, 2) keypad effort and 3) needing oven mitts to remove hot plates (a little exaggeration, but I certainly considered it on many occasions) was just a little too much.  Who knows, maybe if I heated more frozen foods that tend to have cold spots (rather than just reheating refrigerated leftovers), perhaps the inverter technology would have been more life changing.  Or maybe I'm missing the fact that it's all about the sensor cooking (which I didn't use) instead of the inverter technology.  For whatever reason, people seem to love this microwave (Panasonics are also highest rated by Consumer Reports).  But for me, it was just ok.  In the end, this unit just made me realize what a major convenience it was to have one button start (specifically 1-6 minute).  Anyway, good luck with your decision.  I hope this review was helpful."
2,"I purchased the Panasonic Compact Microwave Oven with 1200 Watts back on 12/21/2019.  We have had no issues at all with the unit, until the other day.  My wife was trying to heat a bag of the microwavable broccoli which should take like five minutes.  She tried to cook it at five min intervals for thirty min and it never did cook.  However, the microwave itself, the outside top became VERY hot to the touch.  I have no idea what's wrong with it, assume some heating element or something has gone bad.  I pulled my paperwork and of course it has a one year warranty and now date is 3/5/2021 so I guess I'll have to buy another microwave...it just won't be this one.  Sad part is I purchased this unit cause our old one was a Panasonic and we had had it for quite a number of years, which is why I purchased this one.  And the reviews were good on it.  Maybe I just got a bad one, either way I out a microwave."
1,"The facing over the control panel is peeling off. That is, bubbles are appearing under the plastic face of the control panel and parts of it cannot be read. Was purchased in July 2020 but warranty only lasts one year."
5,This is really nice looking microwave.  It was very easy to set-up and use.  The microwave easily accommodates a full size dinner plate.  The best part about the microwave is it keeps the the noise level to bare minimum.  It is also really easy to clean with just wet towel.
3,"It is a very good microwave oven.  In general, I am very happy with its performance.  What I'm not so happy about is that I chose it because it had the measures to fit in my microwave cabinet. And it would have fit perfectly... except because the directions specify that you have to allow 3 inches on one side to allow for airflow.  So, now I have an empty space in the cabinet and the microwave over the counter..."
1,It burned my food after just 2 months of having it.I can’t return it. Never buy that againI tried it again and it did the same thing. I disconnected it because I didn’t want a fire
3,"Works fine as a microwave. It really needs both lighting for the buttons and an instruction book, so I don't have to keep looking up how to cook something without going first to the website manual. When I put chicken on the top rack it started burning before the timer quit. It burns most things I put on the tray on the shorter rack when I use the  degree settings such as baking a slice of pizza or muffins so I have to keep checking it instead of waiting for the timer to complete. I hoped it would also worked to toast bread but apparently it doesn't."
5,"Does the job perfectly. I haven't used the convection or fryer options, but it's a great little microwave so far."
1,The media could not be loaded.Was never super in love with this microwave but in the last week I can honestly say it is a piece of junk! If you only need a microwave for a year- this may work for you. We have owned this just over 2 years (and have taken great care of it) but the enamel has worn off in a section of the base and is bubbling up and peeling off in all sections of the base. It seems totally unsafe now that metal is completely exposed!Don’t waste your money.
5,Easy to use and looks nice. Bought this for my office and so far so good
5,This microwave arrived extremely fast. Outstanding shipping! With this being of 1200 watts food cooks much aster yet come out perfect. It i very easy to use and seems to be quite reliable. I have been so happy with this microwave that I purchased a second one for a friend! An outstanding value!
5,Good power
2,"Counter microwaves are not what they used to be and this one was no exception.  I babied it to make it last (I hoped).  Never ran it for more than 5 minutes at a time, used it at most a few times a week.  Unplugged it after each use (to avoid it turning itself on as apparently many brands/models do).  Aired it out for a minute after each use (to avoid rusting, as many reviewers of several models/brands stated).  And *most importantly* I stood looking at it while it was running (in case of fire, another common issue across brands).  Lo and behold, I'm heating up something for exactly 1minute and 25 seconds.  Operation seems completely normal.... till a horrid odor envelops the room.  Since I am LOOKING at it, thank goodness, I see the flame erupting in the side pocket where you would normally see the little light.  Unplug it immediately, carry out the sliding doors onto the patio, disaster averted.  But what IF someone was not present and it was operating for a longer period?  Dangerous.Fire hazard aside, it was a decent microwave otherwise.  (hence 2 star vs 1)."
5,Have to wipe it out after each use seems to get moisture when done using
2,We have this microwave and I have to admit it does not compare to our others.  I guess I downsized without realizing it.  We have had it 6 weeks now and all of a sudden the beep to let you know it is done keeps going on even after you open the door.  We haven't figured out why.
2,the unit broke down after 8 months
3,I like the microwave except for the fact that the control panel does not light up. This makes it difficult to use.
5,"For a small microwave, this is the one! It works as it should and has a simple easy-to-follow keyboard."
1,Clock keeps loosing time
3,Very low power sorry I purchased it
1,Doesnt cook food or heat it up even on 30 seconds. Gotta almost add a minute extra for it to work and get warm
3,"Very slow, takes 3 minutes to heat up a cup of coffee"
5,"Arrived early, came well-packaged, set up in minutes.  Very quiet. Almost silent compared to my last one.  I like the memory function a lot."
5,I liked it alot
1,Dont buy it a piece of junk
5,Great counter top microwave.  Looks good and works well.  Quiet.  I'm very satisfied.
5,"The size of this was only slightly bigger than our current toaster oven. This does what that toaster oven did PLUS is a microwave PLUS an air fryer. To us, a better use of counter top space."
4,"This is a very nice, well-built microwave at a reasonable price. That said, my only complaint is they make the instructions more complicated than need be. I feel I have average intelligence, I build computers, so I have a pretty good knowledge of electronics. Setting the time on the unit is not that straightforward, it took me a little while to figure that function out. Next, you have buttons from 1 through 9. so you would think that buttons 7, 8, and 9 would be just that but no, they are not, you can only use 1 to 6 for time cook and you must use 7,8 and 9 for other functions or you may include those numbers if you push another button. Confused yet? I have read the instruction manual several times now and still am confused so I must be stupid, or cannot read and understand English. The whole point to me is, using a microwave oven should be simple and I find this unit is making it harder than need be. Would I buy it again, I would hesitate I fear."
3,"I had some simple microwave for years and did not know I can hate a microwave until we got this one in September'20... It heats food VERY unevenly with one side burning and other one remaining cold. Small amounts of food (e.g. cat food) burst all over the place in less than 10 seconds (it has been getting worse with time)I cannot adjust any settings (e.g. power, etc.) - and yes, I read the manual. The microwave is VERY LOUD (especially the door closure)... I wish I returned it in time."
1,"We have issues with microwave, its overheating and it turns off."
1,"Just did not expect it! The machine blasted off a small chip of glass from the spinning disc when I was heating a cup of water because this time I heated it for 3 minutes instead of 1. That is a bit longer, but not too much, right? The machine could not tolerate high heating or long heating somehow, so when I open the door to get my hot water, a small chip of glass jumped out of the door. it was burned off from the spinning disc because of the heat! But it was only 3 minutes!Not even mention The first time, when I just got this machine, the first day I put a small meat pattie to heat for 1 minute. All of sudden, I heard a boom! My little meat pattie jumped out of the plastic container and messed up the whole microwave inside. It was 1 minute! So it did not spread the heat evenly but could only heat one spot extremely hot. So I decided not to heat solid food anymore but water only. Still, the heating chipped off the glass because I heated it for just 3 minutes! is 3 min really long??? Literally, you bought Toshiba Bomb into your house!"
5,Controls are easy to use.  Cooks and reheats well. Appearance is good.  Priced right.
3,"After a few days, strange noise when using this unit, it’s like the motor that spins the center tray is very weak or just poor quality, everything else works great .. just have that feeling it’s going to die soon!"
3,"Bought this unit to replace my dead ge microwave (just stopped working after two years).  I notice a lot of condensation on inside especially on door after using microwave, which the old unit never had.  Additional improvement would be lighted buttons to see what is being depressed.  I hope this one from ge lasts more than two years."
1,"I just cleaned my microwave, scrubbed it down, wiped it down, ran it for a few moments to help with any residual moisture (as I have with ALL my microwaves because I don't like the idea of potentially having missed some of the chemicals I was cleaning with). Waited about 5 minutes and went to cook in it, hit the button, and it died. All lights went out. The clock went out. The interior light went out. And there is no turning it on. I have tried unplugging it and waiting about 15 more minutes and NOTHING. This is not worth the price that they've got on it if it's going to die in less than 7 months!"
1,The printing on the control panel is very light making it extremely difficult to read.
3,Compact size. Heats quickly. Door op e ns and closes without issues
2,Item was too small would not accommodate bacon cooker
5,"Ok so after my last microwave blew up, I was lost.  I realized I was 35 years old and had never bought a microwave before.  I had been gifted two in my life.  One when I went to college and one when I moved out on my own.  Luckily for me I have had some great luck with long lasting microwaves.After reading for nearly two days and not being any wiser as to what I wanted or needed, I stumbled across this.  I had started to make a checklist in my head of what I wanted and what I certainly did not want.  I certainly did not want another Frigidaire microwave since mine had blown up.  That was a bit too real for me.  I also wanted something with more power, ie; at least 1000 watts.  I wanted it to be sleek, and not giant, but also be bigger than my last microwave.  I wanted some good reviews where my questions were answered and people who are in the ""unfamiliar with microwaves in general"" club could get a better idea of what in the world it all means.  I needed guidance and I got it.This microwave came in perfect packaging straight from the manufacturer.  It could have been dropped off a roof and had a solid chance of being fine.  It looked great.  It was sleek, with stainless steel and black lines.  It doesn't beep forever if you forget about your midnight snack, it has the capability of the :30 command, it does the thing where you hit 2 and boom, 2 minutes comes up.  It's quiet, it's 1000 watts, and it's consistent.  The handle is super easy to use and it doesn't slide around. The tray spins and is easy to assemble.  People said they were weirded out by the fact that it was gray inside.  I was weirded out by the fact that I had ever not had a grey microwave.  My friend Sara came over and I showed it off.  I mean I really, really like this.  Can you tell?  These issues are all concerns I did not know I had until I read up about microwaves.  Trust me, these are allimportant things.  This is NOT the microwave for you if you live in a small apt or college dorm.  I have a lot of counter space and this was just fine for that.  I have had 0 problems with this and I recommend it to anyone and everyone who is looking to purchase a new one.  I will update if it happens to blow up, but I have a feeling we're going to grow old together."
1,Within 6 mths the button that opens the microwave broke! Also the bottom of door started coming off. Had long enough for no return so stuck with it now.
2,"This was a good microwave for over a year. It cooked quickly and fairly evenly. It’s easy to clean. But without warning, it started hissing and smoking. I saw sparks inside the microwave (there was only a small bag of popcorn inside.) when I vented the smoke, there was a hole burnt in the side panel. If I hadn’t been standing next to it to notice, it could have been a lot worse. Maybe buy a better model?"
3,So I bought this as of many people thinking that it was going to be a cool little new microwave to replace an old one that just died something newer and maybe had a couple new features well finally got it well first Amazon and USPS decided to send it to the building next over so I had to search all day to figure out where the hell it was.. next I plug it in and I try to go through the simple process that it tells you in the little guide and it doesn't work so what does any other logical person in 2023 do I look up a YouTube video or at least two to make sure I'm not just getting scammed both videos showed they got it to connect perfectly fine why did I get the lemon exactly I'm also customer coming from the Panasonic 2.2 cubic foot commercial grade microwave to this so I'm a little disappointed as you can tell most likely we'll be returning
5,"This is easy to use, and it fits my large dish. It has all the usual special buttons. The time can also be manually set. It is a little heavy. The glass plate inside rotates to heat the food evenly."
4,"Unfortunately the outside side vent clatters whenever the door is opened or closed.  GE wouldn't replace it, but is sending a Goodwill certificate in the amount paid for the appliance to be used on any GE product .  The certificate is to be mailed with the new appliance receipt and then I will get the refund amount.  Kind of unfortunate they can't just replace it.  I had to go through Amazon to get this result."
4,Easy to use fairly low powered however
5,"Great size, easy to clean, easyto use selections. It's surprisingly quiet👍and it looks nice. Con: I would have preferred white to match other appliances."
2,Price drop- i know why!!!Bought two for the two kitchens in my house. Both broke down completely shortly after the one-year warranty expired -piece of crap. All my other microwaves have lasted decades. Only bought new ones for new functions.
3,so far so good
5,Bought it for a friend in another state. She received it a day before it said and she loves it. She says it makes her coffee very hot
4,Whatever cover material is on the control pad is coming off but the microwave is great
1,But it's too much trouble to return. So I'll just have to get used to setting it for heating times twice as long as with the old microwave.
3,It’s a little noisy but otherwise looks good and runs well.
5,Performance is great would buy a gain
5,use couple weeks，so far very good，touch responsive
5,The unit is big enough to warm up your food and small enough to sit on the kitchen counter in your apartment.
1,We purchased our Panasonic “The Genius 1200” from Amazon in April 2023. We’ve had it for 4 months now and the microwave plate literally cracked while being washed (by hand) and now the microwave keeps arcing. There is a significant electronic burning smell and it is causing the fuse to blow each time we attempt to use it. It is to the point we feel unsafe using it. It is still in like new condition and has no reason to be arcing. Save your money.
5,"This item is exactly as described. The size is perfect as the handle on many of these units sticks out too far for the appliance garagei know that this isnt a super duper heavy duty item at 700W so it takes a little longer to heat . But thats understood. I have it for size and convenience - buttons are easy to understand.I don't see any problem with the push button actuator to open the door. Its cleary market to push as a lever release.I put my 10 1/4"" dinner plate in  just fine and turntable functions as needed.I was going to buy a black and decker model but glad i didnt - this GE is way better looking"
5,"This is a nice, classic microwave.  It is 1000 watts, compatible with most frozen foods with microwave instructions.  It has all of the classic settings, most of which I don't use.  It has 10 power settings, and I definitely use those to defrost  frozen stuff and soften butter.  It can also do two-stage cooking. For instance, you can defrost something at 30% power and have the machine automatically switch to 100% power to cook the food.  My unit is the non-crisper version, so it is basically just a microwave.  Do you know that the majority of microwaves are made in the same factory in China and just branded differently?  Based on that fact, I assume it will last as long as any other unit."
2,Esta muy chico
4,Lasted about 1 year 4 months so I recommend on getting this with add on warranty or buying another model with a long warranty.
3,My old Samsung had smaller stats but more room inside. It says in these directions you must use the tray and it shouldn't be restricted. A bag of popcorn hits the sides and it stops the plate from turning. I also miss the button that opens the door. You have to pull the handle. Call me lazy but the button is nice.  I'll have to buy a bigger one although it'll take up room. I love popcorn and I stand there watching the bag not turn afraid of fire.  I did open the door and shake or turn the bag. There was lot of unpopped corn but the popping had stopped.
4,"The microwave works very well. Some of the buttons are a little confusing but after reading the instructions, got the hang of it. My last Panasonic microwave lasted for over 30 years and I use it frequently which is why I bought another Panasonic."
1,You can not see into this microwave while it is on. So if you want to see your food through the window… you can’t. Is it still called a window when you can’t see through it?? Why is this even a design?
3,"I'm beginning to loath this microwave.  You have to touch/push numbers on the number pad multiple times to get it to react.  For example, this morning, to heat water for coffee, I pushed 1 three times, 0 two times and 0 three times.  Then ""start"" a couple of times.  When it finally starts cooking, it's very fast but it's a challenge to get it to the point of cooking.  It's attractive although I wish the push pad that opens the door showed fingerprints a little less obviously.  I end up cleaning it every couple of times that I use it."
5,"This is a nice size microwave, it has 13 1/2 "" turntable so you can use larger dishes in it. I feel it takes awhile to get use to it, now that I had it for a few weeks I like it very much. it's strange that it doesn't have on and off marked on it, I guess they think we should know that, you soon get use to it. I like the extra 30 sec. when you think it needs a little more time. Over all I like this one, I would buy it again."
1,"I mostly loved it until it just stopped working after 9 months. (The broil function was never very good) I purchased the Asurian extended warrarnty and just tried to file a claim. I got a response that said it is still covered by the manufacturer's warranty. I am trying to sort that out now, but the process is not clear."
4,I use this microwave daily for cooking and re-heating meals.
3,"I had it for about six months and now the start and ""0"" button doesn't work! The most timportant buttons"
5,This microwave is super quiet and works very well.
1,The microwave was great until it stopped working 16 months later.
1,Worked a total of 38 days then just started doing nothing but click!Contacted the manufacturer and got a run around!  Finally hung up!Had my last one from GE 6.5 years!
5,"My old microwave was fairly large, so this one is no problem. It's only 2"" bigger from front to back (I'd call that width or ""depth"", so some of these lengths and widths descriptions confuse me; it seems backwards when the longest inches from side to side (or left to right) is called ""width"". I don't recall how this one stated it. There's still a few inches of space left in front of if you have a standard counter. Since I placed mine in a corner, that's not a factor.I'm sensitive to loud fans and ""white noise"", so I'm happy that this one runs rather quietly. I like the 30-sec setting, can just press it twice to get one minute rather than press 1-0-0.. The 30 seconds doesn't heat my coffee enough when it goes cool, but 1 minute will produce a soft boil.Closing the door without pressing the ""open"" button is rather loud (for anyone), but pressing the ""open"" button before closing it produces a soft sound; that's got to be easier on the door and prevent wear and tear on it.Being new, I haven't tried much in it, so I don't like giving it 5 stars yet, but seems unfair to give it less Then again, it makes me wonder about the credibility of any 5-star rating if sellers push for a review (this one didn't). I'll will try to update you if I run into a problem. I was literally ""a day later and nearly $200 dollars short"" when my neighbor (who's selling his house) gave us his large microwave today; he was going to just set it on the street for trash pick-up - and nothing's wrong with it!  I guess I should get out and talk to my neighbors more often. But, dang, couldn't he just give it to charity? It's not like you have to haul it in a truck you don't have."
1,"The product is too small for most counters. It worked for 3 months and then caught fire. The problem was with the plastic device (turntable shaft) that turns the glass plate. This part is defective. I started the microwave today then noticed a horrible smell, like burning rubber--the inside was filled with black smoke and I saw a small flame. I stopped it and of course unplugged it and opened the door--had to air out the kitchen and the house for several hours because the smell of burning plastic was really bad. I'm surprised because this is a GE product and I've never had anything like this happen with GE before. I called GE (their website is very well done and their customer service is excellent), and I'm going to file a report.Now I'm looking below and see that this has happened to someone else. I'm going to put this in my report. I have logged a 'case' at GE--and perhaps they will redesign this turntable shaft because this one is defective."
3,"In my opinion, gray numbers on a black background is a poor design choice.  A few more dollars for backlit keys for the controls and the numbers would well be worth the expense.  The first few days of use I was on my knees trying to see which keys to push.  That design flaw is my only disappointment ... otherwise, I'm 100% pleased.  Noise level is much lower than with my previous microwave oven.  It didn't take me long to figure out cooking/heating times."
4,"I've used the Chefman 1.3 Cu. Ft. microwave for about a month. Best thing about it is: it heats food very fast compared to the Toshiba it replaced, which was the same wattage (1000w). At 1.3 Cu. Ft. it's very roomy; the glass turntable is 12"" including the rim (11.5"" usable). The interior width is slightly bigger than the turntable. The interior height is about 8"", measured from the rim of the turntable, see photo. The interior light is dim, I can see the food, but brighter would be better. The light comes on when the door is open and while the microwave is running. I've used most of the settings, except the pizza, all work well. The weight defrost works great, I like the convenience of that. I love the mute to silence the beeps. When you mute it stays that way, unless the microwave loses power (unplugged/power outage), then you have to reset the mute. The control pad markings are difficult to see in low light, but in average or better lighting the markings are easy to read. Overall construction is excellent. The only issue with how it's constructed, is the omission of grippy feet on the bottom. The microwave slides horribly on the counter, which is my biggest dislike. I added some grippy tape to the hard plastic feet on the bottom and it's no longer an issue. The door can be opened and closed quietly if care is taken. Motor/cook noise is acceptable, not loud, but not quiet (quieter than the Toshiba it replaced). This is a well functioning microwave, while not perfect, it's a solid choice. Recommended."
4,It’s nice to get what you thought you paid for in condition you thought you were getting
4,Owners manual could be vetter
3,"The plate on the inside doesn't spin at all.  The microwave itself still works but I have to add some extra time due to the uneven cooking caused by the plate not spinning. Otherwise, if it was to work like it's supposed to, it would be great."
1,It doesn't have all the parts so it doesn't work.  Tried contacting the seller.  No answer.Returning it today.
2,"It’s compact and the controls are simple, but the stupid turntable keeps dislodging and getting the plate or bowl sideways."
2,Works great while it works. Dead after 7 months. I would not recommend.
1,"This GE 4n1 appliance is THE WORST buying decision I ever made in my seventy years on this planet! The functions look nice but I can not use them be cause I can not see the control buttons. No one in my family can see the controls (not even the young men and women). Controls are not back-lit; even with a flashlight which sits ready beside my shiny new microwave I can't see what is written on the buttons. The lettering is so faint it is impossible for me to understand why a group of engineers would think this is acceptable. For a few dollars more they could have manufactured a back-lit panel or even brighter lettering. I would have paid many dollars more for a readable panel. I can not return this useless thing! My choices are: use a flashlight and squint when I cook, or donate this to charity, or just throw this expensive new gift to myself away. I should have bought something else. PLEASE, do yourself a huge favor... DO NOT BUY THIS GE 4n1."
4,The media could not be loaded.It works takes a bit to pop popcorn the bag got stuck on the rotation plate as it is a pretty small microwave it does the job though!
4,I like the quietness if operation.  The microwave is certainly hot.  Four stars because it doesn't have a manual defrost that I can set as desired and the black keypad is difficult to see.
3,Not as advertized.
5,"I was very impressed to see how sturdy and high quality this microwave turned out to be.  We looked at several others and they were cheaply made and would often tip forward when the door was opened. This  microwave does not tip when opened, which is huge. Since it will be used in a dorm and more then likely will have a tray of various supplies on top of it. My daughter also likes the silencing feature. This will help minimize disturbing roommates when it is being used late at night."
5,"Yes it's been almost a year since I've purchased this microwave.  This microwave gets daily use and it is still going strong. I've not use the Alexa part of the microwave, but I use the weight defrost and it's great. I usually put it a few ounces below actual weight ..... it's easier to cut that way. The one touch minutes feature is so nice and the 30 second option is a much used feature in our house.  I've had microwaves for many years and this is the best one yet!"
1,"After owning this microwave than less than a year I received an error message H98 and no longer functions.  When attempting to contact Panasonic’s customer support, the automated service tells me to visit their online service and when I attempt to do that I’m given yet another error message.I would not buy Panasonic products from Amazon as apparently neither one will support their products.  Better to buy from a retail store like BestBuy where you have a chance for actual human help/refund/exchange etc.Very disappointed to say the least."
1,"I admit I can sound like Abraham Simpson from time to time, ranting about the good old days when appliances lasted practically forever and were repairable when they weren't, but this time it's justtified.  I grudgingly began the online shopping process for a new microwave after the 10 year old unit (a hand me down from my grandparents that replaced my prior 15 year old unit) finally quit, and as is often the case, nearly every unit whose reviews I checked (not just this brand, but also Sharp and others) all reported a high number of D.O.A. units or premature failures.  Well, with trepidation I ordered this touchpad unit which arrived promptly and well packed, and I was initially thrilled with its special features like sensor reheat, as I cautiously placed it into service.  Something told me I should ""save the box"".  Sure enough, after four delightful uses, most with sensor reheat, and certainly less then ten minutes cook time, the unit failed utterly with an ""H98"" error code (bad Magnetron/Inverter circuit), and won't recover.  So after just a few days, it is back in the (original, saved) shipping box, and lugging it to UPS for a return.  Dagnabbit they just don't make 'em like they used to."
5,Works as it should. No complaints.
5,"Recently moved to a smaller apartment, this is a space saver. Works great."
4,"Original Review: I bought this to replace a similar  11 YO Panasonic that failed.  So far I really like this unit.  Looks nice, works well, bright interior light, handle rather than push button door (hated the push button on the old one). But the killer feature is Alexa control.  Setting this up is is a bit of a nightmare (see review of the related skill) but once set up it's FANTASTIC. This has to be the best and most genuinely practical use for Alexa I've found. There's no reason to ever push a button since everything can be easily voice controlled. Very pleased I opted for an oven with this feature.Two Month update: downgraded to 4 stars because Alexa feature operation is spotty (can't find the unit).  Alexa worked great for a little over a month and now works only about half the time. (it works one day and not the next)  The unit can be controlled from the Midea app very reliably even when the Alexa feature is not working, so the oven and my network are fine - the fault is on the Amazon side. This is more than a minor inconvenience because the manual controls are not overly intuitive.  I guarantee you won't get it to cook for just 20 seconds without closely reading the manual...hint it takes 5 button pushes (most ovens require just 3)"
4,It works well but after a few weeks has started to emit spitting noises like sparks jumping so I’m afraid it’s preparing to die!
2,"It works, but it heats the food unevenly.  My old microwave from college was much cheaper and worked much better.  This one looks nice, but doesn’t perform well.  I suggest finding a different microwave."
4,"Update, July 2020: We bought this in May of 2018. About a month ago the LED light started flickering and is now dead. I find this is common and that a replacement is expensive and hard to do. Downgrading this to 4 stars.__________________________________________________________________________________________________I'm giving this little microwave 5 stars because I'm very pleased with it. It looks nice, just fits my space, and heats foods quickly even though it's only 900 watts. The price was great, too.It's not loud.The built-in kitchen timer is handy.Unlike some reviewers, I haven't had a problem with it slipping on my countertop when I open the door, even though the countertop is slick tile.It IS small--a dinner plate just fits inside it. But that's what I wanted.I had to get used to the bright whiteness of the LED light, but like it now.The mute for the beep is fine, if you keep it off. It beeps when you turn it off, though!The oven came with a complete owner's manual in English and another in Spanish.My only hesitation in giving 5 stars is that the box gives evidence that it was dropped hard in the warehouse. Fortunately, the inner box and the styrofoam packing protected the oven from denting; we hope no damage was done to its insides. At first I thought they'd sent the wrong size because the box was huge and heavy. Turns out it was shipped in 3 boxes! There was a strong brown outer box, then the Toshiba carton, and inside that a strong brown inner liner, plus protective plastic and styrofoam. We've used it several times a day for 9 days. So far, it works perfectly."
4,"Upgraded to 4 stars. Became more impressed with the heating of food.dislikes -PRICE! Found a Panasonic @Sams Club for $112, similar model. ; Quick 30 second button STILL requires you to press Start? Not very sturdy either.likes. -It heats food very well!Look elsewhere before buying this micro. Unless they substantially lower the price. $150 or lower."
2,The start and stop buttons went out 2 months after purchased
3,"It seems a bit under powered for its size. And air frying is weak to say the least. Takes longer than manual says to do anything. We’ve pretty much given up on the “air fry” aspect & just use it as a microwave. And even then your dish, whether it’s a bowl or a plate might be 500 degrees but the food is luke warm."
2,I have a small space. Still wish I had sent it back.
2,The microwave beeps loudly 5 times when it is done even if you open the door. Sound cannot be turned off.
2,I have to say Amazon’s return policy is terrific easy I ordered there brand microwave with echo should come in a couple of days I hope I can  write a good report on this microwave and echo dot.
2,"Our old GE microwave finally gave it up, after issues with sparking that I could not mitigate.  So, we bought this Panasonic after seeing the reviews and trying to find same dimensions and size in white.  I was aghast at the quality level!  I'd be surprised if this unit lasts 2-3 years, given the way it is constructed.  So many examples:  the cheap plastic turntable roller (would break if you breathe on it hard); the cheap plastic latches (look like they could break easily, and the door does not fully close unless you push it just right and in a certain spot); the push-button that opens the door (very flimsy, and I can see it also breaking easily).  This microwave weighs roughly one-half of our older one... the component parts are very cheap and flimsy.  You push the door closed and it moves backward a half inch.  Also, it seems near impossible to turn off the beeps.  The interface to get a quick 30-second cycle takes TWO pushes, rather than one like our older unit, which just runs.  Everything about this microwave just seems cheap, including the look.  We considered boxing it up and sending back... but I fear this is just representative of the quality you find today."
2,Received the microwave which looks amazing with great features.Ince I placed it on my counter noticed it was not stable and rocked.I turned the unit over to see if the there were adjustments or levelers  and there was nothing I could adjust.Now I have the inconvenience of boxing up the Microwave  and shipping it back which is a large box .
4,It was to small for my liking
1,"Do you love running the microwave over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again?Do you get sad that your hotpockets only take 2 minutes to cook?If you answered yes to either of these questions then this microwave is for you!  Let me start by listing the pros to this little machine!  Oh and when I say little I mean little.  When I opened the box I was like oh must be the wife ordered a microwave for my daughter's play kitchen, but then I saw the electric cord.  It was definitely smaller than I anticipated.  Picture ordering a microwave from wish.  I am pretty excited though because it fits nicely on top of my 2 slice toaster.  I kid I kid.  My toaster is a 4 sliceThis bad boy will heat your bag of steam vegetables in as little as 12 minutes!  For those keeping score at home thats twice as long!Honestly this microwave is one of the best purchases I have made in quite sometime.  Before this microwave my wife would spend hours and hours pushing my buttons.  Now she spends all her time constantly pushing the buttons on the microwave.  Just her in the kitchen reheating and reheating instead of hounding me about doing yard work.Enjoy your new microwave!"
1,This is the worst microwave. We’ve had it a little over 6 months and it’s difficult to use and fails to heat things up. Takes twice as long as our last microwave.
2,"I think it's got a high score because it works out of the box (at least).I was expecting something of a higher standard from all the reviews out there.Of Note:- It works and came well-packed without damage.- Fairly light weight- Quiet, once it gets goingSuspect:- The control panel is covered with a flexible plastic material (not to be confused with the protective film). When you press it, you're still activating a contact switch of some sort. For that, you need to depress the plastic cover and eventually, it will show indentations.- Finger prints and smudges are highly visible on the polished surfaces, silver and black.- The unit is fairly small (.9cu), so the side housing the mechanism is much heavier (front right).- The back is not flush. Part of the mechanism bulges out. I guess that's how they're saving on weight and size."
3,Nice looking unit but lacked some basic features I am used to on microwaves.  No single touch start by the minute or 30sec add time button. Took longer than my less expensive Hamilton Beach 700watt unit does to heat food.
3,"Works fine, easy to figure out, easy to clean, but they took cheap shortcuts with the keypad and the plastic sheeting over same started to wear out within two weeks.  It still works, but is ugly, and had the look of an old appliance within a month. Would not buy again."
5,"Works as intended, good price."
1,"I loved this Microwave/Convection/Air Fryer for three months. It worked great! Baking, french fries, microwaving. A week ago it worked in the morning and didn't work in the evening. In the interest of troubleshooting according to the manufacturer's directions, I unplugged and restarted(3 times). I also moved it out onto my counter from the roomie built in cabinet and still no go. After discussion with Midea and Toshiba Lifestyle Customer Service, sadly I will have to take a refund in the form of a check mailed to me because they do not do exchanges nor credit back to the original card. I was hoping that I maybe just got a lemon and a new oven would fix it but that wasn't an option."
2,THIS IS NOT  A GOOD KITCHEN TOOL.  IT IS VERY LOUD AND WILL STOP WORKING IF YOU USE IT TOO MUCH (IT OVERHEATS).  I WILL BE LUCKY IF IT LAST A YEAR.....
4,"So far the microwave is good, but it has almost no directions and we don’t find it intuitive. I am sure we will figure it out eventually. Tried the air fry feature and it was ok."
4,Got it as a interim solution while we were getting our over-the-range microwave replaced.  Worked fine.
2,The display is broken. The lights for the first two digits don't show.
3,Works great but just to bothersome using the air fryer and convection oven.
1,"This thing is so loud, it's unnerving. Not just the cooking sound either. The beeps are also loud enough to hear when I'm upstairs with the TV on."
1,"By the time it reached the destination the box was damaged, and the microwave was in pieces. I decided not to send another one. Did not want to take the chance."
3,"A great looking microwave that performed well. So well we only used that function for 2 weeks. When it came to the convection oven, it was a different story. Even if I ignored the nonstop sound of something stuck in bicycle spokes, I couldn't forgive the flawed cooking. Never even bothered with the air fryer since I needed the other functions for my tiny kitchen."
4,"So far so good, just unboxed yesterday, pretty much identical to previous unit, very quiet and working fine.  Only issue is a very noticeable DENT on top front corner.  Could have sent it back but not worth the time to ship it back.  And since I've done lots of metal repair/body work have all the tools to straighten it out, you may want to study up on general repair work if you should purchase this item. GOOD LUCK"
2,Didn’t expect it to be so small!!
5,"Really like the handle versus my former microwave required pushing a button to open the door. It is lightweight, I alone was able to lift it out of the box and place it on the countertop. Although it is 1000 watts versus 1200 watts, I find there is no difference in how well it cooks the food or warms up coffee for 30 seconds. Really nice stainless steel design and more compact than my former microwave but inside room about the same. Interior is dark rather than white thus hides those small splatter specks, which invariably come more frequently than a major cleanup requires."
4,"The only reason I rated this unit as a 4 rather than a 5 is because  the user is unable to use another  microwave function when using the timer. For example, when I'm using the timer for something not related to the microwave (i.e. keeping track of how long I'm cooking something  on my stove top) I am not able to go ahead and use the microwave for anything until the timer is off. Often times I end up changing the balance of the time to a mechanical timer and that, then, frees up the microwave for use.  Very frustrating.  No issues other than that. May sound trivial but it's a pain."
1,"Strike 2 for this Toshiba Microwave.  First one received and the clock won't set.  Directions say push Clock Timer once to set clock, twice to set timer.  You can only push it once and it goes to Timer, no clock!  Also, inside the oven is a cardboard heat shield.  It was ripped.  What genius puts something so fragile in a microwave?  Sent first one back and against my better judgement ordered a second one because I have a very specific space this fits in.  Second one arrived 2 days later and same damn problem with the clock!  Very disappointed with this thing.  Toshiba Customer Support was no help."
3,"I like this product but I am dissapointed because their is no On/Off switch to turn the oven off.  You have to unplug the oven to disconnect it and turn it on.  Very inconvenient because I have to move a cabinet to get behind it to get to the outlet.  If I had know that ahead of time, I would not have ordered it.  I had it about 3 months before I used it and could not return it after the time frame allowed."
2,It makes strange noises when it’s being used. I wish I got a different one.
1,Didn't work at all
1,This doesn’t have heat at all. It’s defective and I call the company they said they would replace it and it’s been months and haven’t heard back. Do not buy unless you want a broken microwave that doesn’t warm food.
4,1 year warranty is nice.
4,"My mother lives in a small 1 bedroom apartment and doesn’t have much counter space. Her old microwave, which was pretty big, took up about 1/4 of her counter. So when it gave up the ghost, I wanted to buy her  a smaller one. If you need a small microwave for any reason, which a regular size plate will fit in, and don’t mind cooking stuff longer, it’s only 700 watts versus 1000, this is perfect. You know you usually have to give something up in order to get what you want."
2,"It's a nice, powerful microwave while it lasts. 30 months is all I got, which is frustrating for a unit that I replaced a 20 year old microwave with. I'm not expecting new gear to last that long, but I did expect more than 2.5 years. I hope you have a better life span than I did."
3,It's perfect for a lunchroom or something. I didn't realize how small it was before I purchased it. However It's a very attractive addition to a kitchen to be sure. Functions are simple didn't even have to read the instructions. Good Buy!
5,Great product for the price.
4,as far as heating food evenly and being easy to clean this microwave is good.I only ding it because i'm NOT able to preset the numbers on the keypad to correspond to a cooking time.Meaning i would think any microwave of today you could press 1 and it would cook for one minute if you set it do so.NO such functionality with this one.
4,Died after two years
5,"Good product, fair price, works great."
4,A great microwave for the price. Fits a full size plate.
3,"After using for several months: Everything the reviews say about the noisy fan is true: it's loud, it's noisy and it's going to bug you. The microwave doesn't 'sound' nor 'feel' very solid. I would NOT choose this as a permanent and frequently used microwave (ie: ""Daily Driver."") I chose this because 1) it was heavily discounted and 2) would be very infrequently used. And for that, it's great and I wouldn't return it. All the buttons work, it works, it's easy, but since its rarely used, things that would normally bug me, simply don't matter.  Look at another microwave if you are going to be using this daily or more frequently than once a day or once a week."
4,"Easy to use. Arrived with a dent in the front, but I needed it then, so kept it. Worth the money."
5,Mom loves it…it was a gift…
4,Wanted a smaller microwave. This one fits on my counter. Is quiet when it runs. Really like it.
1,"This microwave worked well enough for a year and then one day as we were heating up a tortilla sparks flew and there appeared to be a flash or fire inside the microwave.  It was a little frightening to say the least.  I went back to read other 1 star reviews and sure enough we're not alone.  The EXACT incident happened to other reviewers.  I contacted Toshiba and explained what happened.  I asked if there was a known issue or any recalls.  I also appealed their warranty stating that it was one month past the one year.  After 3 emails and 5 phone calls I was ultimately out of luck.  Sure, a warranty is a warranty but there is definitely something up with this product.  While they didn't admit it I'd bet that Toshiba knows EXACTLY what's going on and they are unwilling to provide any support beyond the one year.  For what it's worth our previous microwave, a Magic Chef, lasted 22 years.  It was a wedding present.My advice is to buy another microwave and avoid Toshiba appliances."
3,The bottom row of numbers doesn’t work.
3,"The BLACK+DECKER EM720CB7 Digital Microwave Oven is a great option for small spaces. It's compact and fits easily on a countertop or in a cabinet. The digital display is easy to read and use, and the design is sleek and modern.However, I have noticed that the heating time is quite slow. It takes longer than expected to heat up even simple items like soup or leftovers. While this may not be a huge issue for some, it can be frustrating if you're in a hurry or have limited time. Overall, if you're looking for a microwave that is small and convenient, this is a good option. But if you prioritize speed and efficiency, you may want to consider other models."
3,The Microwave has a dent in the top right corner that was not done in shipping but at the factory.The styrofoam was not damaged. To late to send back
3,"I had to buy a smaller microwave foe my apartment. This looks nice, cleans easily, but it takes almost double the recommended cooking time, for just about anything"
5,"This was a replacement for our old one. Very nice and sturdy. Good quality, fair price and fast shipping. Would buy again."
3,I have had this for 4 months and the clock has already quit.  It makes me wonder what will be next to not work.  I have already thrown away the box it came in so I don’t really see me sending it back.
3,Item is black on front only. No LED menu/almost impossible to operate. Cheap off shore product.
3,This microwave move the dish inside of the microwave and makes bangs. It also is a huge fire hazard. Besides that it’s a great microwave but I have to pause the microwave every 20-30 seconds to make sure it doesn’t do any of this
2,Too small- a bag of popcorn doesn't have room to turn. Standard plate has to be tipped to one side to fit in. Its a no.
4,Simple instructions and was to use
1,I bought this to replace my 20+ yr old 0.6 cu. Ft unit and this is SMALLER then that
1,"First of all I have a perfectly level counter, I've never had a wobbly microwave before One leg had to be shimmed up. It won't stand stable on its own The edges are sharp, the open and close I don't want to call it,a button? I'm not sure what to call it but it's very wiggly and it's obviously going to break in no time. This is not what I expected from Panasonic, it's going back! I started this review when I got it in November of 2020, In the past few weeks it Baganda to take 2 min to heat a normal size cup of coffee it is now not working at all.... 2 yrs and 5 months later..."
2,"I do not know, it does not warm up food faster no matter the materials used. I think I received a defective product. I will not advise anyone to purchase it."
3,"I bought this microwave to heat my coffee.  Other reviews were not too positive, but the price was cheap and it does heat coffe just fine.  Touch pad is hard to read at some angles and requires pretty good pressure to press a digit.  The door does not allow you to see through it to watch the progress of your meal, coffee or what-ever.  The door is however a real good mirror so you can watch yourself frown while trying to see if your coffee is boiling over inside.  The unit is very light weight and looks real nice and professional.  If you are like me and just want an inexpensive microwave to heat coffee or an occasional snack, this is the one.  If you are planning to use the oven on a daily basis in your kitchen as the main microwave for youre meals, you will be disappointed."
5,Perfect replacement for my fried Frigidaire
1,"Lovely design. Looks sleek. I was happy with the design. Had to be wiped out after every use because condensation would collect on the side and puddle in the corner and under the turntable making it the cleanest microwave I've ever had. Purchased in October 2020, and pronounced it unusable last night when trying to heat up a cup of soup. After about 2 minutes, the odor of burning wax filled the small kitchen and I saw smoke inside the oven. Quickly I shut it off and pulled out the cup to see if by chance there was something besides soup in it. There wasn't. Just the lentils, no candles or any foreign objects in the cup I often use to microwave soup in.I stooped over to see if there was anything on the roof of the oven. It was then I noticed rust on the upper back wall near the top. Did I mention I bought this oven in October 2020? And that it was wiped down after each use? It was only used to make a cup of tea in the morning and to warm up prepared food and the occasional bag of microwavable veggies.I will not buy the Farberware brand of anything again. This was the most disappointing appliance purchase I've ever made."
2,"Doesn't match my other real stainless steel appliances, and doesn't have a 30 second button and is very small."
4,"I looked high and low for a microwave to replace our under-counter 10-yr old unit.  This one ticked all the boxed--large capacity, medium-sized footprint, and plenty of advertised power.  It is not a heavy unit-- the door and door's open button feel less than solid to me.  The control panel layout is slightly confusing, and since this is under the counter, not having a backlit on the keys is a learning curve disadvantage.  Overall, it is a 4-star unit.  Heats well and evenly, but the design and components could be improved."
2,I bought this microwave to replace my other microwave and also be able to have a larger air fryer. I was pretty disappointed when it showed up and the unit did not sit flat on my counter. I had to shim two corners by about a half an inch each to make the thing not rock. The biggest disappointment though was the fact that it doesn't actually have an air fryer built in. That part is an absolute lie. It has a button for air frying but it's not a real air fryer. Doing frozen french fries in my actual air fryer gets them done in under 10 minutes. This microwave took about 40 and didn't do nearly as good of a job. The last complaint that I have about it is that you have to be careful opening it so that you don't fling the whole microwave off the counter. It's best to use one hand to brace the microwave and the other one to pull the door open. The only good thing about this microwave is that it actually looks very nice and I have no complaints about how it operates as a microwave.
1,"Poor Quality, topped by poor customer service. The light inside microwave started fluctuating after the first year warranty was over, and at about the two year mark it started malfunctioning with burnt plastic / electronics smell coming from it.I contacted Toshiba customer service and they asked for purchase date and details first. And then proceeded to ask for all my personal contact information and microwave issues leading me to believe that this is a company that truly cares about its customers. After wasting staying on line and providing all the information, they simply said warranty is over so nothing can be done. So why on earth Toshiba could have told me that to begin with.I am not going to buy another Toshiba product and not going to recommend to anyone who cares about quality products and good customer service."
4,Great microwave brand!
1,GE No longer provides user manuals with it's products. Have to be downloaded from a site. Unfortunately this was s gift for a elderly relitive .without knowledge of the internet / printing process. Vey inconvenient for all involved.
5,"Love, love this microwave, air fryer, convection oven!!  Life saver!!!"
2,"A nice looking oven but it's missing an essential feature.  At the end of a cook cycle it doesn't provide a finish message.If you don't hear the ""beep"" there's no way to determine there's something in the oven without looking inside.Every microwave that I've owned in the past had this feature. It's feature rich except for this important message.I regret my purchase."
3,"We had this microwave for almost 2 years. Unfortunately, it started setting fire every time we turned it on. Kind of like it would do if it had foil in it, but it did not have anything in it at all, and it would still do it. We are having to throw it out now because it is very dangerous. It looks to us like one of the actual parts to the microwave has been burned through, and possibly exposing metal. It even started toWe had this microwave for almost 2 years. Unfortunately, it started setting fire every time we turned it on. Kind of like it would do if it had foil in it, but it did not have anything in it at all, and it would still do it. We are having to throw it out now because it is very dangerous. It looks to us like one of the actual parts to the microwave has been burnt through, and possibly exposing metal. It even started to burn The wall behind it. Aso note: This microwave seemed powerful when we first got it, but after less than a year it was harder to get things to heat up. What used to take one minute, would now take 3 to 4 minutes. It definitely lost power over time."
2,"I like that it would cook and shut off based on the level of steam coming off the food.The inside of the unit was painted metal which rusted badly due to the constant steam level in cooking. It was so bad I had to replace the unit. Couldn’t stand to put food inside such a rusty oven.I replaced it with a GE oven, which is stainless steel inside."
2,"We bought this a as a backup and replacement.  It works well enough.  But has two very annoying features.1.  The noise level is incredibly bad.  It may be a bad unit, or it may be the way it comes.  We'll decide shortly whether or not to return it (something we seldom do).2.  When the ""done"" ding goes off and you open the microwave door, it keeps dinging for the full five times.  It should cut off when the door is opened.It probably makes more sense to pay $20 more for the competing low end Toshiba model from Amazon. We chose this Farberware model because it had a week shorter delivery date, and our microwave oven ain't working."
4,"it works pretty well.I like the design. However, I'm not sure if the function keys are heating the food evenly. I used the pizza button like three times to heat it up to an edible temperature. It was okay with one time but half of the parts were like a bit chilly.I know this could be solved by just using a normal heat because I think the 'pizza' button has a lower temperature setting as compared to the normal heat. Overall, it's a good for the price. No complains."
1,"It worked okay at first. Noisy, but nice to have the air fryer option. They do not offer repair.if you manage to get through to actual help( which GE hides quite well) they will send you an email, then you reply with your receipt. Then you get another email and can go buy a new one. They will MAIL you a form that you fill out and mail back to them. THEN they mail you a physical check. Ridiculous and time consuming. Lots time and effort to end up with the same unreliable  appliance."
3,Core reason for purchase is most microwaves use the same parts so shoot for the best price. This unit does it's job but gonna call ps on the wattage.
1,"The media could not be loaded.This microwave didn't last even a year and I had to throw it away because it became horrible on the inside. I only cleaned it with soap and vinegar and it ended up looking horrible like that. I've had other brands of microwaves before and this has never happened to me. Maybe it's from Poor quality, anyway I have to throw it away, don't waste your money, read the comments very carefully."
4,"Works fine, no issues with the door at all (was nervous after reading about them in other reviews), defrost is cool in that it changes the power of the magnetron rather than pulsing on/off at full blast. Not 5 star only because some extra features are implemented better on other microwaves I've used but for the price this is a great unit."
4,I like the microwave very much. It's easy to use and I like the looks of it as it's very stylish I think and it works well. But I'm taking off a point as it requires a grounded outlet apparently and where it's going I don't have one.
5,This microwave is so powerful. It will heat your food up in 2 minutes. It is massive though. Great addition to the kitchen. Great buy!
1,"There's no +30 seconds button. You can't just push stop and then start a new thing. You have to hit stop, then reset, then enter something to restart the microwave. This is ridiculous. You could get away with a microwave having ONLY a +30 seconds button, and literally no other buttons, and this doesn't have one? I am returning this immediately. Add a +30 Seconds button you neanderthals."
5,Used in a busy deli and it’s the perfect size.Ordered it and it came in a day!!! Awesome
1,Overheats after continuous use and stops working until it recovers. Very expensive for the capacity.
5,love it
4,Just what we wanted for the teens kitchenette in the basement.
2,The screen is off center so you can’t even see the time.
4,"I recently purchased this microwave and I'm very satisfied.  The interior size is fantastic and the exterior size allowed it to fit in the same location as my last (smaller interior size) unit was.  It definitely is more powerful.  And I love the quieter non-pulsing design.  The ""Inverter Technology"" seems to work fine (maybe better), but without the buzzing like my last microwave.  So why only 4 out of 5 stars?  Well, maybe the Inverter Technology works too good.  Or maybe just my unit isn't calibrated correctly?  I like the reheat feature, but it relies on detecting steam and then continues for another 30 seconds.  So, reheating means bringing things to a boil and then letting them boil for another half minute.  That's a little overkill for reheating.  And when I make a 3.5 oz popcorn, I need to use the 3 oz setting or it'll slightly burn the popcorn.  The rest of the button features work well with one suggestion.  When I push the add 30 seconds button while the unit is off, why not just start it instead of making me press the start button.  The same for the reheat.  Basically, any button that you don't need to make adjustments to after pressing (such as selecting the size of the popcorn bag) should just start cooking."
4,"Looks good, fits great, and works well."
5,Perfectly replaced my built in GE microwave that died after just a few years. They have an identical outer shell so it used the same brackets and everything.
1,"Exceptionally disappointing microwave. Barely heats, barely thaws."
4,Was a gift
1,The control pad is not aligned and we have never been able to set the clock or use any of the power level controls. Unfortunately I missed the return time window or this would have gone back. As soon as I’m able to afford a new microwave I will be purchasing one from a different manufacturer. Very disappointed with this product.
4,I bought this for my college dorm since it was relatively small and had a mute function. It worked rather well for about 3 years. It I pretty ease to clean and efficient for heating food. The last few weeks it has been overheating? The usual time for food has changed with it sometimes heating My pumpkin bisque caught fire last night and my ceramic plate broke while heating up a hot pocket that ended up burning. Overall the microwave has worked well but I wish it last longer.
4,Easy to use
2,I'd bought this bit when I touch the oven I just felt a static. At the couple days then start to make a noise too. Overall a bad experience with this. The design was beautiful but didn't work for me.
5,"This works like the larger, more expensive models, only, of course, weaker so longer cook times. Like the ""time defrost"" in particular. Great little microwave."
1,"About six months after purchase, the clock stopped keeping time. I got tired of resetting it. Two months ago the interior light started malfunctioning. No telling when it will stop working altogether."
4,"It is a bit loud, it seems like the side panel is not on tight enough, when you press it gently the sound of the motor is lowered.. there is also a slight gap between the body and the front, does not seem to inhibit function in any way but does make me slightly concerned with the structure and stability, but have had no issues.  I have still used it because returning is a hassle, it works very well and heats things up quickly and efficiently and looks good while doing it.  I have since moved and have no space for it in my smaller kitchen, so be mindful of the space you are looking to store it."
3,"A response will always be a late. One has to constantly use a microwave to warm food up, but the fact that it came with no instruction manual...really? I can't even press ""half"" numbers for seconds-damn shame..."
5,Just the right size for college
4,"Beautiful and fits perfectly where we need it. We have had this for a couple months now and so far it is holding up well. However, it is the loudest microwave I have had yet. The noise is concerning, but seems to be normal given some of the other reviews. However, it doesn't vent well at all. I've never had to let a microwave ""air out"" after use due to a build-up of steam, but this thing is like opening a sauna after as little as a 30 second run. Like I said, no serious issues yet, but I'm keeping my eyes open on this one."
1,"The microwave arrived dented, door misaligned, noisy, and we could see the light through the sides and top of the door.  I am returning and not ordering it again."
4,I read the reviews and saw some not so good reviews but gave this a try anyway.  We have not had any of the problems listed (bought in the unit in February of this year).  After 8 months the inside light went out.  Could not have asked for a more professional experience with their customer service.  They were prompt in addressing and resolving the problem.  So thank you for the experience!
3,Got this smaller microwave for popcorn and such because I wanted to stop myself from cooking in the microwave. It seemed to fit the bill for about a month then started getting fussy. Now about every 3rd or 4th bag of popcorn it does not heat all the way so pops only 1/3 to 1/2 the kernels don't pop so we lose the bag. Don't bother. Look for another brand or model.
5,Best microwave I have ever owned. You can actually heat things up without a cover and it will not splatter and it has smart technology.
1,"1.  This MW in NOT 1.5cf, at best it is 1.2cf if you measure teh nooks and crannies, but a straight up measurement across the door makes it 1.1cf.2. Amazon allows this sort of false ""puffing"" to take place and they are as much at fault for allowing it to happen as Toshiba.3.  Good luck crisping a chicken skin with this MW as it doesn't bake the chicken in am manner that you come out with a roasted skin.4. Mfg and Amazon very hard to deal with because the price of this mw will entrap you and then you find out it is not as advertised and everyone throws their hands up but noting is done except give your money back.  In the meantime we are on our 2nd unit and that one went back and so not MW for the next month until we can find one that really works.  We've had a Sharp convection for years but the last one lasted 1 year.  I think though that they are truly the only game in town."
3,"We bought a house that had a microwave.  We didn't like the microwave because it was small and noisy, and half the buttons didn't work.  (On the other hand, it worked and it came with the house).  I wanted the Toshiba with the convection option.  This microwave makes EXACTLY the same noise as the free one. My hubby won't microwave 2 things at a time, so being bigger has no advantage.  We won't return it - I'm not sure why we won't, I just know we will not.  I'm not a happy camper.  I am happy to have a microwave.  Just not happy it's this one."
1,"I bought it March 31st, it is August 10th and when I got a hold of them immediately saying it was loud they said that was normal. Now it sounds like there's an airplane trying to take off in it and I'm afraid to cook in it..... Don't buy it."
1,"I used this very lightly, average. The paint begins to flake inside the oven and on the door window fade. This defect/damage happens slowly (barely noticeable). Then when the warranty is just over the flaking and fading paint becomes quite bad ( see attached pics). Called Toshiba was told not to use it. It’s unsafe. And of course they could not do anything because it was out of warranty. I’m livid and extremely disappointed. Do not buy unless your in the market for a microwave that will be useless after the first year!"
5,"Initially purchased this in December of 2016. It finally died on Feb 5, 2023. Longest life from any microwave I have ever owned. And the inverter technology allows true power reduction for cooking more delicate items. Power is actually reduced instead of the typical on - off cycling of most microwaves. During it’s life it survived a teenager and two moves, one of which was across seven states. Totally sold on these Panasonic Inverter Microwaves and will be buying another (smaller one this time) in the same series to replace this one. Highly recommended!"
5,"This is the nicest countertop microwave I've ever owned.  The color is stunning, bright, and cheerful.  Love it!"
3,My old magic chef microwave died and I needed another quick. Bought this one based on reviews and I have 2 issues. 1) the kitchen timer function - when you set the timer to countdown it doesn’t beep at the end. What’s the point of a timer if it doesn’t alert you when the time has run out? 2) the  touchpad buttons are not responsive unless you hit them in the perfect spot every time - it’s annoying.
4,If anyone out there is wondering if this will fit their deep covered baker - yes. =)
1,Don’t buy it it won’t last
2,"Well, another Panasonic microwave bit the dust for us. This one only lasted 2.5 years and had 115 hours of use (you can get a readout through a sequence of button pushes). Our last three Panasonic microwaves lasted approximately 3, 6, and now 2.5 years. It appears that a short lifetime has become common for microwaves but I think that a 3 year and below lifetime is just not acceptable for an appliance that costs more than $200.This one died with an ""H98"" error. There are many references on the internet. One of the other microwaves became unusable because of the stupid latch design getting worse and worse before just breaking. Many references to this on the internet as well. Make sure you close the door VERY gently. Come on Panasonic, just add the 3 cents to fix that problem and the $1 or two to keep your oven from breaking in a couple years. I'll happily pay the marked up additional price! But I've had it....we're off to another brand.This is very sad. I wish we could have the first Panasonic microwave which worked better than any of the ones mentioned above (and lasted longer). It's inverter technology was clearly superior. Defrosting was accurate and complete with no browning. Cooking was even and predictable. But the ovens got worse over the years and none of these newer ovens performed as well. We strayed from Panasonic once before but weren't happy with the performance without the inverter technology. So, despite the performance degrading over time and my disappointment with reliability, I added star to the rating because the performance still seemed better than the competition.But now I have found another brand that offers the inverter technology. The patents must have expired. Let's see if Toshiba is any better."
5,"I was long overdue for a new microwave and because I have a red kitchen I chose this one . I love it , it's perfect in both style and functionality.  This one is definitely an upgrade from my last smaller old one ."
4,"I ordered the “1.1 Cu. Ft” version of this microwave, which is what seems to me like a standard size, and it does not include the MicroCrisp feature.Appearance-wise, I like this microwave. It matches my kitchen décor, and it looks relatively sleek and classic at the same time. I dislike the thick grooves where the stainless steel body overlaps the perimeter of the door, since debris and dust will likely build up there in a gross way that might not be so easy to clean. I’m pretty picky about everything being spotless, so seeing that space gave me some anxiety. Other areas I’m worried about gunk collecting are the button that pushes way inward to open the door and the vent area on the top, back-left of the microwave. My last microwave was completely flat on top, so my family had gotten into the habit of using that space as a shelf for bread items. Now, I worry about things blocking that vent and stray breadcrumbs getting into it. I was not exactly wanting to lose “shelf” space. The touch pad feels nice and is intuitive, and the large push-button to open the microwave door works well, though I would have preferred a handle instead, which would stand a lesser risk of getting gunked up or breaking with normal use. The push-button also shows fingerprints big time, so I know I’m going to be wiping it down constantly. Compared to my last microwave, when this is cooking, I can see inside much better. The door provides your typical light diffusion, but I can still clearly observe my food’s behavior. It kind of sucks that this microwave requires so much clearance on the back, sides, and top, as that doesn’t really work with my minimal counter space. Also note that because the top requires 12 inches of clearance, this unit cannot be mounted directly under a cabinet.The included instructions are quite good and get quite specific about what can and cannot be microwaved, in case you’re not already educated on such matters. They also cover some basic troubleshooting in case your food is not coming out how you expected. Additionally, the instructions walk you through the specifics of operating the features, including one that can lock the door so that kids are prevented from using the microwave unsupervised. All your standard, modern functions are there too, such as quick-cook (where simply pressing any of the numbers, 1-6, immediately starts it cooking for that number of minutes), +30 SEC (which, during cooking, adds 30 seconds to the cooking time for every time you press it), and defrost. This microwave is definitely audible when cooking, but it’s no more bothersome-sounding than my previous microwave. It does sound slightly different, which is just something I’ll have to get used to. And so far, it has functioned as well as any other microwave I’ve ever used.Unfortunately, I encountered a fatal flaw almost immediately. One of the first things the instructions say to do is to remove all the packaging materials, but they don’t get any more specific than that for this step. So, when I was removing the packaging materials, I looked inside the microwave for any such materials and came across what looked like a thin, cheap piece of packaging cardboard on the right-side wall. Naturally, I pulled it off. Much to my dismay, a large hole was revealed beneath that didn’t look like it was meant to be exposed. Looking at the flimsy piece I had pulled off, while the paper did have a slight metallic sheen, I figured it couldn’t possibly be a permanent part of this otherwise nice-quality unit, especially since pulling it off had already started breaking it. So, I decided to look up what it might be and discovered that it was an absolutely essential part called the Waveguide Cover. My previous microwave’s waveguide cover matched the inside of the microwave and didn’t look at all like packaging material, so I was unaware that something like this might be a standard component of many microwaves. Realizing how important it is, I tried to re-insert it, but the tabs that lock it into place simply broke off immediately, as they exhibited almost no flexibility before snapping (see my photo). So, I knew I had to contact the brand to see if they could replace the part. Immediately, I received an email saying they’d reach out to me in 5-7 days, which is quite a long time for a brand new item. Thankfully, they got back to me so much more quickly than that and were very helpful, sorting out my issue entirely so that I have a microwave in complete, working order, even if I wish that piece on the inside could look less like packaging material. Overall, they provided excellent customer service, so I commend them for that. I also learned that this waveguide cover is such a standard piece that may require replacing over time that it’s easy to find inexpensive replacements online or at a home improvement store.Overall, I’m relatively impressed with this nice-looking and nicely functioning microwave, though I’ve obviously been able to nitpick it."
4,"Oy, I sure wish there was more extra capacity for square or rectangular portion-size dishes to save myself an extra pricey houseware expenditure (i.e. Williams-Sonoma in Dedham).Beth Budner, Auburndale, MA!"
3,This is not the size I thought this microwave would be it's too small is smaller than the one I had at first
1,"This product worked fine, until it didn't. It stopped working 11 months & 2 days after the purchase date. It began sparking & there was a burned area on the right-hand side wall. Pretty scary.  That an apparently ""well-made"" appliance like this lasts less than a year is quite disappointing. I don't know if other brands are any better, but I would advise staying away from this one."
1,The product itself is okay. However it tells you to text the receipt so I Sent the receipt from Amazon showing I paid for it and it does an automatic reply saying send a photo of receipt. I dud this four times with the same response.  I can't get a warranty on this so I am not rating this very high at all.
5,"The media could not be loaded.I love it. Don't care about sound- it's a microwave. No button to open door, but I don't care about that either."
3,It's truly for small spaces. A big bag of popcorn cannot easily move and if you have larger plates they may rub the walls. It's a great little one.
2,"I have owned micro-convection ovens since 1983 and have never had a unit like this.  The racks do not anchor to the turn table.  If you try to use a rack for convection cooking, it slides around the oven and makes it difficult to remove food.  The rack tips and the pans slide off.  I have gotten burned trying to keep dishes from falling or spilling on me.  My previous ovens, Kenmore and 2 Sharps did not do this.  The racks fit the Sharp turntable pan and were very secure.  These racks are way to small for the turntable.  There is also an element in the top of the oven that does nothing but get in the way, making cleaning difficult.  The entire oven looks like it was put together with leftover parts.  The convention is not perfect.  Breads do not bake without having to add additional minutes.  The top temperature is on.y 425 and doesn't do very well  baking pizza or dishes that require higher temperatures.  If you want an expensive microwave, it works well on microwave.  Forget it for other uses, particularly if you want to use racks.  It will not utilize two racks at once.  I tried the racks from my old Sharp and they are too large.  Also, the interior may say 1.5 Cu. but it doesn't accommodate larger pans and is smaller than my microwave.  If I could, I would return it and get another Sharp.  The features on this oven looked good but I am disappointed.  Also, the energy saving feature is annoying and may contribute to the less than satisfactory convection cookiing."
1,"Bought this microwave as a temporary microwave because my over the range microwave went out. After about two weeks of average use I noticed the microwave was growing mold, no big deal, bleached and cleaned it. After about another week I noticed a pungent moist smell coming from it when I opened the door to use it. Noticed that if you microwave anything with liquid, the moisture stays inside the microwave afterwards. The whole top of it was wet and molding. Poor insulation I guess. It’s great for minimal usage but if you have a family of 3 or more, would not recommend."
5,Detailed Operation Instructions on how to work all the ovens options need to come  with the item or have helpful instructions as where such information can be obtained!
1,Head part missing the round thing that goes under the glass plate
5,Large interior and especially enjoying the convection and air fryer settings.
3,"Really loved this microwave for the first two weeks. It heated noticeably evenly and was very easy to use. After a couple weeks, the left side of the numerical keypad stopped working. I did end up buying a Panasonic replacement and just hoping it won't have the same issues."
3,"I’ve had no issues with this microwave, but the buttons can be frustrating. They’re not sensitive, so you have to press quite hard. It also feels like the buttons aren’t aligned intuitively with the electronics behind the scenes. Would be 5 stars if buttons were better."
5,great value for the money.  easy to operate... hit one and it auto runs
2,Well Every time I use this product doesn't matter what I put in it. It will start to smoke up and come out of the microwave.When this happens it has made my smoke alarm go off twice.
4,It works very well.
2,This is a really nice microwave but I was pretty shocked to find out the glass turntable was missing. I guess it was glass. Don’t know since it wasn’t in the box. At this price for a convection microwave no part should be missing!
5,Great
1,Bought less than 8 months ago and it's dead already
3,I didn't realize just how small this Microwave was going to be
1,"I waited to long to return the microwave, besides burning the popcorn on the popcorn setting, it smells like burnt wires, I thought it would go away after a few work out, but it still smells"
1,"This is the second time I have replaced this microwave. I am heating food for 30 seconds at a time once or twice a day. Nothing crazy. And the inside panel has caught on fire each time, about 3-6 months of using. I can’t return of course because of return policy!"
2,works great but the dark keypad is very hard to see unless there’s a lot of light in the room.  would not buy again
1,"After I warm up something, this microwave started dinging constantly.  I have to unplug the microwave to get the dinging to stop. Also, the start button is supposed to automatically warm up something for 30 seconds if you hit that button only.  It will warm 30 seconds sometimes and only 10 seconds another time.  It will pick random times to warm and doesn't do what you want it to do.  Most of the buttons are defective on it.  This is a terrible microwave.  Do not waste your money.  Oh and of course it worked fine until 42 days later, then all of the problems started (after the return window)."
1,Bought it on Jan.30th. It should get zero stars. Product arrive with a broken plate ring. Since it's a cheap piece of plastic we asked black and decker to send us one. We had to jump through hoops to get them to okay it. It will arrive after April 22nd. Today went to open the door and it doesn't open. The button just pushes in. The return date deadline with Amazon was march 2nd so can't return it to Amazon.  Call black and decker and they want a video of me pushing the button and the door not opening. Totally ridiculous.  I will never buy anything black and decker again.
4,"Overall, the MWO seems to work well and makes good use of space for it's capacity. I rate it 4 of 5 because it is very noisy. The noise is more a rattling rather than normal MVO sounds. This is a minor annoyance but worth noting."
1,"It wasn’t a bad microwave and everyone said Toshiba when I was in the market for a new one. However, it didn’t even make it a whole year."
5,Just got it. Tested it and it works perfectly and quietly. I think it looks great on my counter next to my air fryer of the same color. Time will tell if it keeps working as it does now. If it doesn't I'll edit this review.
5,I love this microwave because it’s small and space friendly while it’s very easy to use.Highly recommended
5,I like it a lot. It fits perfect just for my space.
3,"It works but it's noisier than my previous microwave while running.  The picture is deceptive as the sides are black, not stainless steel.  The door opening button is very hard to push and noisy as well.  Customers with hand and wrist issues my want to look at other models.  Overall this model feels cheap, but than again, you get what you pay for, I guess.  If I had bought this at a physical store I would have returned it."
1,"Mainly used this microwave for popping corn and heating milk for tea or coffee. Not sure what caused the pad to burn but, microwave acted like it was about to explode. Definitely staying away from this make and model."
3,The first thing I did was scratch myself on the jagged metal door. Other than that it seems to work.
3,The media could not be loaded.Estoy desilusionada porque se ve mal y no lo puedo devolver ya que pesa demasiado y rompí la caja al sacarlo
4,"I purchased this in September 2021, it stopped working in October 2022. I like it a lot, but not failing one month after manufacturer warranty ends. I am buying it again, and adding the warranty extension so that if it does fail again, I am able to have it replaced."
1,Ring was damaged.
3,"I really wanted to like this microwave.  But for two reasons, I didn't even get to the point where I tried cook anything in it.  First, I wanted a microwave that was at least as big on the inside as my current one.  In the photos, this microwave was listed to be 15w x 9h x 13d, but measured with a ruler, it was actually only 13w x 9h x 13d.  That's actually a bit smaller than my current one.  So, already, that's one thing against it.  I also wanted a microwave that didn't affect my 2.4 ghz wifi and this one did.  As soon as I turned it on, one of my router signals was knocked off...the same one that was knocked off by my current microwave that I wanted to replace.  My older smaller microwaves (which I've kept as spares) did not knock out that signal.  Another way that I tested was putting my cell phone in the microwave and closed the door and try to call it (cell signal is at almost the same frequency), and my phone rang.  This also happened with the microwave that's been knocking out my wifi, but my phone doesn't ring when it's inside my older smaller microwaves.  *sigh* very disappointed."
3,It is a good microwave and huge but doesn't have quick settings as my previous. Also after you heat there are no reminders. If you forget to pick up whatever you were heating it can turn cold.
1,Received in damaged condition. Returned. Air fry app seems very awkward. You can't control which modes execute when you use quick buttons.
5,"Me ha resultado muy útil pues el que yo tenía se me rompió, ahora les compré este más pequeño y me ha resultado fabulosoMuchas gracias."
4,For my RV tear drop Small
4,It looks good
2,It was great until it stopped working. I can turn it on but it won't heat or turn off.
3,One of my microwave pieces were broken.
4,This is nice and compact. It is easy to use. I just don't like that even though it is new it is not heating that well. You have to add a minute or two extra if reheating leftovers. My old one heated much quicker.
4,"I recently purchased the Countertop Microwave Oven, and overall, I think it's a decent appliance for those who have limited counter space. As someone who lives in a small apartment, I appreciate how compact it is, as it doesn't take up too much room on my countertop. Plus, it's great for reheating basic foods like leftovers, soups, and frozen dinners.However, I do have a few complaints about this microwave. Firstly, I don't think it has enough power. It takes longer to cook or reheat compared to other microwaves I have used in the past. I wish it had at least 1000-1200 watts of power to make the cooking process faster. But, I also understand that if it had more power, the physical size of the oven would be bigger.Despite this issue, the microwave functions like any other microwave oven. It has a built-in light, and a rotating, removable, washable glass turntable to keep your food evenly cooked or warmed. It's convenient to use, and I appreciate that it's easy to clean.Overall, I think this Countertop Microwave Oven is a good option for those who are looking for an appliance that won't take up too much counter space and is great for small reheats. However, if you're looking for a microwave that has more power and can cook or reheat food faster, you may want to consider something else."
1,"No where in the descriptions does it say ""refurbished"" ""Used"" or anything along those lines.  The box was destroyed when received and the microwave was not secure, no packing to keep it from moving.  The box said thanks for giving this product a second life. It was supposed to be a new product.  Never even opened the box. returning. Disappointed."
3,Way to small
5,This was for my son who lives in a one room apt.  Very littitvroom for kitchen appliances. This was perfect & he also said it works perfect. Very happy with the product.I also bought the warranty for 10.99. But it has never arrived.?.
4,Works just as advertised.  Very happy with this product. Only thing I would change is being able to control the volume of it beeping when it finishes cooking.  A little loud for my taste.
5,"This works great, fits on the counter nicely, and is large enough for all lunch items that need to be reheated. It's quiet, the buttons are screen font is large and bright and easy to read."
5,Arrived fast and love product.
4,So far so good. Great little microwave!
1,Was nice and fit in space that I have but stopped working after two days.
4,nice product
4,"This is about as basic a microwave as you can get but it fits the microwave niche in the kitchen of our rental home. It works well, you can fit a dinner plate in there and it reheats the food."
4,Great for small spaces. If I could change one thing - I really wish this microwave had a “+:30” button. I’ve realized it’s really the only button I need.
4,"Boring Stuff:The product(s) arrived on time, as described by Amazon & manufacturer, it was shipped without issue, arrived within prescribed estimates, the packaging was undamaged, and the product itself was unmolested and made with quality materials.  Description, photograph, website presentation, and what arrived are the same-size, shape, color, and it matched my expectations.Pros: easy to use, great size, works fine, very light, and good lookingCons: make sure it is well ventilated, on all sides!!!  After cooking rice for 10 minutes and another dish for about 8 mins, the unit was very hot and at some point, maybe 15 minutes into our meal I noticed the unit had shut down with a beep and restarted...the best way to describe it actually...as if it had been unplugged from the wall.  I examined the exterior, interior, gauges, temp, defects, all of it...found nothing wrong (no obvious layman issues) and realized it was too close to the wall.  I haven't found any white paper, but I assume it overheated?!  Working great now, I've moved it away from the wall and make sure it's well ventilated when in use etc. and no repeat issues."
3,"Not as well made as I had hoped. The legs are uneven, it feels cheap, it heats up food though so that’s a plus. Was just expecting a much better microwave for the price."
3,"Really like this microwave.  It cooks and heats food thoroughly, (fairly powerful) was a good size to fit in a small kitchen, is easy to operate and attractive .  The only drawback is that whenever I use the unit the interior has a lot of condensation so that I have to wipe out and dry the unit after each use.  Don't want the build up to start to get moldy with the door closed.  Not sure if it is a design flaw or something with my unit."
5,Perfect for my small countertop. Definitely recommend
3,It's definitely not a quiet device. Much louder than the one it replaced.
3,Gets to warm while on outside could hurt a child if touched  watch your kids  Sad
4,"I havent even used it yet but wanted to say... this came USPS for some reason and required an adult signature. WHY!!?? Getting it was a MAJOR pain. If you work for a living during the day and are expecting this to be delivered like all other Prime deliveries, dont make the purchase. I'm sure it works fine but not worth the trouble getting it."
2,There are way too many buttons to push for simple tasks.  This issue is exaggerated because the touchpad buttons do not line up well with the characters/icons on the touchpad.  You have to press the exact right spot on touchpad and often times end up pressing adjacent button.It's just a very frustrating unit to use.
3,Heats amazing!!! its really big and longMy one and only issue is that the plastic is already bubbling on the number.
5,"I bought this after my old microwave died.  It works great as a microwave, it's very powerful and extremely quiet compared to my old one.  I wasn't sure about the convection heating or air frying but I'm impressed.  The air frying works just as well as my countertop air fryer and it I've made french fries and other things and they've turned out really good.  But the biggest surprise was the convection cooking, it really does act as a second oven.  You preheat the oven and then when it beeps, place the item in the oven and set the time, then hit Start.  My convection gas oven had a problem so I tried the Convection setting to cook a couple of frozen apple turnovers.  It worked perfectly just as if I had cooked them in the regular oven!  The only difference is the max temperature for the convection oven is 425°F.  This microwave would be a good choice for someone college dorm or tiny living area, all they would need is an electric hotplate and a mini-fridge to have a full kitchen."
3,"We had a house fire and needed to replace a lot items. We were also really looking forward to saving counter space by combining appliances.  Based on the features and reviews we decided to try this model.We patiently waited (with no microwave) for about a week and was disappointed to see that it was severely damaged. The box wasn’t damaged but the unit looked like it was smacked with a pipe.  OK it happens so round two.  Again waited a week and opened it to see another damaged unit.  The damage was a small dent and we didn’t want to wait another week so we kept it.The microwave functions as well as any microwave.  I do like the sensor heat/reheat which functions better than other microwaves we have owned.  Make sure to read the manual so you can take advantage of all the features.The air fryer is junk. We own a gowise air fryer and we’re hoping to stick it in the closet to save space.  I decided to do a head to head with some ears of corn.  Both units had the same amount of food, same temp, and the same time.  When they finished the Toshiba corn was raw but the gowise corn was perfect.  It took 2-3 times as long to cook air fry in this unit and it just wasn’t as good.  It didn’t take many more tests of other various air fry favorites to understand that this combination just isn’t that good. If you have never owned a real air fryer then you may love this, but you also won’t understand why people rave about air fryers.If you have the space find yourself a good countertop air fry oven and get a regular microwave."
1,Please don't buy this.
5,That's beautiful the grey is shining I love my new microwave It works great so far I'll buy this microwave again just love 😍 it Thanks
1,Everything takes longer than the directions on box says to cook for
5,Product recieved as described great shipping I am a happy customer
4,"Perfect size for the few microwave needs of warming liquids, heating hot packs and melting cheese or chocolate."
1,"Bought this to replace a different brand which I had for over a decade. Did my research; read reviews; pondered the decision.Sometimes the little things make a huge difference for whether an item is great for a particular user. The little things make this microwave a daily irritation.1. It doesn't have as many quick buttons as I was used to--used to be able to push 3 and get three minutes without any other pushing. On this unit, I need to push 3, 0, 0, start to get the same result.2. My old unit showed ""ready"" on the screen when something was done heating. This may seem like no big deal, but some family members consistently put things to heat and then forget them. The ""ready"" screen was a silent but useful reminder that something was in the microwave.3. I live in an area where the power lines are above ground and storms knock out the power fairly regularly--sometimes for only a minute and sometimes much longer. Every time the power goes out, the microwave loses its settings. In order to reset it, I have to unplug it, and then I need to reenter a number of choices. This is really annoying.Review Part 2--THE WHOLE THING STOPPED WORKING AFTER THREE MONTHS. CUSTOMER ""SERVICE"" SAID I COULD CARRY IT IN TO A SERVICE CENTER--IF I COULD FIND ONE OPEN--IF I COULD TRANSPORT IT--IF, IF, IF!DON'T BUY THIS MODEL AND I DON'T PLAN TO BUY PANASONIC AGAIN!!!!!"
3,"Too complicated! I really miss my old one, it had a button for beverage, another one for potatoes. This just has popcorn! For anything else you have to look up the sensor cook setting from 1 to 14. There are also ten power levels ( too many choices!) I f you just want to time cook you have a 30 sec button that you have to keep pushing to get several minutes ( my old GE just had buttons!) otherwise ok, probably good if you actually cook a lot in a microwave but not if you just use it to heat water for tea, cook a potato, cook anything by time, etc."
3,Just a little to small other wise when ordering didn’t pay attention to the size
1,So sad when I got home my hubby had this all set up and it did not work. No power what so ever making it to the microwave.  Guess i need to get one locally now since Family is coming for a week tomorrow.
5,So happy with my purchaseGreat Microwave
1,I was never thrilled with it but after a few months it just stopped working.This is the first time I have ever had a problem with Amazon.When I first called I was told I couldn't return it because it was several months old.After much arguing that a microwave should not die after only a few months they agreed to return but was only refunded 2/3 of the original price.I ordered a new GE from Best Buy with free shipping am thrilled with the product.This whole experience has made me start rethinking Amazon more and more places are delivering .Amazon definitely is not what it use to be.PS never buy a Toshiba microwave it was really bad.
5,Very attractive...high quality...heats fast and hot foods are perfectPopcorn comes out in under 2 min never burnedSo happy to have the extra wattage
4,"I loved my last Toshiba combo micro and convection oven, so when I saw there was an air fryer option I was so excited.  When I got my appliance there were no instructions how to use the air fryer option only a chart inside the door which was no help at all.  Other than that it works fine."
1,The panel broke off the first month I used it. It is extremely cheaply made. I returned it right away.
5,"I replaced a 25 year old microwave in my rec room with this one, and couldn't be happier. It is compact and good looking, but loaded with features. Works great!"
4,Came in a day. Easy to use and very strong.
2,"I am returning the oven after one day.  The keyboard buttons were very hard to press, so hard it moved the oven itself, and often I had to use the other hand to brace the oven just to press a button.  Some of the buttons seemed not to be centered and I had to press them ""nearby"" and not in the middle of the button.  The sound OFF button did not work.  I could not change the power while the oven was mid-cycle.  Had to stop and start over.  The OFF button, the most important, was very iffy and often did not respond.  I read another review that said the buttons were ""off-center.""  Also, my first impression was that the keypad's numbers and buttons were too small.  Not like my GE.  Also, two of the buttons had shared functions, that is, they did two things, as if Toshiba wanted to save money.  It is so hard to buy a microwave online. A shot in the dark.  Reviews don't help.  People are so complimentary.  You never know why.  But I'd suggest you read all the negative comments thoroughly to see if there is a pattern.  You'll soon know what to believe.  You will notice that many microwaves have many one- or two-star ratings.  It's as if the manufacturing of microwaves has sunk to a new low.  I have to shop for  another new one ... and thank god Amazon makes it so easy to return.  Next week I'll order the new one and cross my fingers. Maybe a Panasonic.  Maybe a GE.  Many brands don't let you turn the sound OFF.  Would you believe that? My GE had 3 different sound levels, and also OFF.  And it was only 160 dollars 9 yrs ago.  Oh, another thing ... the first few tests to boil water were successful but I smelled an electric ozony or new-wire odor.  Worried me a bit, tho it was probably okay???  It was otherwise a nice looking oven, rather solid, and was packaged very carefully."
2,"Love this microwave. But I won’t be buying a replacement. We used this for a year and it suddenly made a different sound, I quickly stopped it and it smelled like smoke. Would have most likely caught fire if I wasn’t standing right there."
4,"The microwave works fine, but the button to open the door feels flimsy."
2,"We've been using the microwave for about 2 weeks and after the first few uses, if the microwave runs for more than a minute it begins to make a very loud and annoying rattling sound. Outside of that sound, it works great"
3,This looks great on photo but it's more suited for a dorm room than an upscale vacation rental.
2,Microwave works fine . Except at the end of cooking it doesn't beep five times as it is supposed to. Does not beep at all. Never has. That is a malfunction.
5,Does what it is supposed to do. Mostly used for popcorn and reheating stuff.
5,Works well
5,Love this microwave. It is easy to use and looks so pretty  in my kitchen. The buttons need to be pushed firmly. This is a very good buy for the money
1,"For a ""smart"" device, this one isn't so ""smart"".  Since DST switched, the clock on this device keeps on switching an hour ahead of what the time really is.You'd THINK that they'd get a firmware update out to fix this problem, since it's been going on for a year or better, but no. They have your money, so they don't care about fixing issues..It's REALLY not that hard of a thing to do, sync time up with an internet server based on your location. Every OTHER smart device can do it, why can't Toshiba?"
2,"It's pretty, but it moves around when it runs.  It also makes noise like a moaning ghost."
1,WHEN IT WAS UNPACKED IT WAS BROKEN - ASKED FOR EXCHANGE - I AM NOT GETTING REPLACEMENT UNTIL I SEND THE BROKEN ONE BACK - THIS IS NOT OK.  I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE REPLACEMENT WHICH I PAID FOR SENT TO ME PRIOR TO ME SENDING THI SONE BACK.
5,"This microwave works wonderfully, it seems to take less time to heat than any other one that I have owned. Be careful not to burn your popcorn! I am very satisfied. I even bought the one that was not exactly ""new"" to save a bit of money and I never would've known it wasn't brand new. Worth saving a few bucks!"
4,"This microwave is an attractive and easy-to-use appliance, well made, and efficient in the use of counter space. The interior is rather dark, however."
2,perfect microwave but wouldn't fit an existing opening
5,"Purchased this microwave to replace our old, defunct one. Lots of good feature. Best thing is, it has a turntable that accomodates our round, microwave bacon cooker. Wonderful!"
2,Stopped working within six months.
2,"I just bought this microwave last week for my office, and the 4 times I've used it to cook microwaveable meals, it burned a corner of the meals EVERY SINGLE TIME. I've tried changing the cooking time and moving the meals to the corner of the microwave. This microwave just doesn't cook evenly.I like its size and style, but next time, I will definitely invest money in something a little nicer."
1,"Bought this microwave in October 2022 and was broken early May 2023. I called GE and they said they don't ""service"" this model. I will have to try a different manufacturer, but for a microwave to only last 7 months is under impressive."
5,"I couldn’t be happier with my Toshiba microwave oven! It has truly transformed my cooking experience. From the moment I received it, I was impressed by its sleek design and user-friendly controls. Here are a few reasons why I’m giving it a glowing review:1. Efficiency: This microwave heats up food incredibly fast and evenly. No more cold spots or unevenly heated meals. It’s a real time-saver!2. Variety of Features: I love the variety of preset cooking options it offers. From defrosting to popcorn mode, it covers all my needs. Plus, the express buttons make it super easy to use.3. Spacious Interior: Despite its compact size, the interior is surprisingly spacious. I can fit large plates and casserole dishes without any trouble.4. Quiet Operation: This microwave operates so quietly that I often forget it’s running. No more annoying beeps or loud humming.5. Easy to Clean: Cleaning is a breeze, thanks to the removable turntable and the stainless steel interior. Wiping away spills is hassle-free.6. Energy-Efficient: It’s energy-efficient, which is great for both my wallet and the environment.Overall, this microwave oven has exceeded my expectations. It’s reliable, efficient, and looks great in my kitchen. If you’re in the market for a microwave, I highly recommend giving this one a try. You won’t be disappointed!"
2,This microwave looks nice and is just the right size  but is very loud. I'm not sure if something is wrong with it or not but seems to work ok
5,Moving micro/ conv/are flyer easy to use.
4,"Love this microwave and bought Toshiba since my last lasted soo long (purchased in 2000). Only small complaint is this size does not accommodate the larger microwave popcorn bags....too big and stop spinning and burn. But again, no worry..love it!!"
4,"cannot see inside very well during cooking. Light is totally inadequate. his is my only complaint. I love the metallic trim. I love the control panel with timer, power buttons and the quick 1 to 6 minute one press buttons. Has presents for defrost beverage etc as well as more precise setting for example for defrost with how many ounces.I love that it as a handle and not the usual door pop out buttonAbsolutely horrified how dim it is inside when lit."
2,Did not work
1,Would not recommend; would not buy again
5,It’s a great size for one person since it works best with small servings. I prefer a push button to open as this model has a handle. I really like it; love that it takes up minimal counter space. Great for my coffee warm ups!
4,"Its definitely reliable and good for the price. Only reason i gave it 4 starts instead of 5 was bc its so light, that many times when u open the door, the whole microwave moves. It doesnt have a large button to press to open the microwave door. Instead, you have to just force open the door a little bit, which causes it to move fwd. But still worth buying."
2,"This little microwave was the perfect size for my countertop and worked great for 2 years until today. I was heating a food item when all of a sudden I hear a popping noise, then I look over and see a small flame burning on the side. I opened it, the flame stopped and so did the microwave!"
5,"This is BY FAR the quietest microwave I've ever owned. All of the features work really well. The air fryer takes a bit more time than a machine solely dedicated to air frying, but that's ok. It still works."
4,Arrived on time and works as expected.
2,Purchased one for my mom as a Christmas present.  It didn't work.  Tried several settings to heat a cup of tea and it remained cold.  It did not come with a book for any troubleshooting.  Amazon is awesome and is replacing unit which will be delivered free of charge and original returned free of charge.  Will update when we get the new one up and running.
5,"We've only had it for about 24 hours, but I tried the convention to hear up a bun for a chicken sandwich. The bun was perfect! It's like it came out of the oven, but no preheat, and still very quick."
1,One month out of warranty the inside light goes out...they won't help and there's no way to access the bulb.
4,"GE, you really must fix this unseeable button situation. Even in the daytime you can't read the unlit words to press the correct feature, and need a light. The microwave is awesome and all seems to work great, and it's BIG!  But you have to be able to see the buttons.  A better manual would help too. I downloaded the online one, but it's quite confusing. Guess it's explore time to figure it all out."
5,We have used this microwave multiple times daily for the last 4 years and have had no major issues. It's the best microwave I have owned in that it heats food evenly and the sensor reheat option actually does a good job at reheating different types of meals. My previous microwave was a Panasonic inverter and this one has lasted longer so I assume they are improving the product.
4,"Very nice look for a compact microwave.  It doesn't fit a tall travel coffee mug, but it does fit a full size plate and all of my food storage containers.  Looks nice on my countertop and fits neatly into the corner space.  Controls are easy to figure out.  Takes longer to cook at this wattage than my previous beast of a microwave.  The family complained when it first showed up, but everyone has adjusted just fine.  Nice quality for the price and I'm pleased with it in my small kitchen.  I've been using it now for about 3 months."
4,"I bought this in mid 2017 and it has run fine all this time. It suddenly started running with no human input (i.e. pressing buttons). It still cooks fine when buttons are pushed, so we keep it unplugged until we need it. I'm here to purchase a new one. Six years is a long time to last these days for any appliance, especially a 'cheap' one. As an added bonus, we won't need to learn any new quirky programming for a different model."
5,Perfect size for our needs!
2,"I like to microwave popcorn, but when I did this with a brand with large size bags, the edges scorched and burned a hole in the plastic on the right side of the microwave. The bag was too big for this microwave, so much so that the turntable wouldn't turn when it was almost popped so it stood still while continuing to pop. I had to get rid of the microwave, and took it to the Transfer Station to recycle. Be careful!! I now have a larger microwave and it works much, much better!!"
3,The appearance of this item is nice.  It has a lot of good features.The reason I have to return it is that it becomes very very hot when one has to cook something for 10 minutes or more.  I'm afraid of it.
1,"We got it out of the box, plugged it in, and left the room.  We came back a few minutes later to find it turned on, plate spinning, and totally unresponsive to the stop (or start) buttons on the microwave.  From that point onwards, whenever it was plugged in and the door was closed, it would turn on.I checked the instruction manual just in case this was a self cleaning routine or something, but I couldn't find anything like that.  I think there's just something faulty with the one I got.  BUT!  There's another review on here that talks about the same issue, so I think there's a quality control problem with this microwave.So we uh... we're returning it.  Because a microwave that turns itself on sounds like a really bad thing to keep around."
5,"This was exactly what I was looking for. Compact, quiet and preforms perfect!"
4,Nice microwave but tends to hold moisture inside and has to be wiped out after each use.
2,"After just over a year, this microwave died. This is the third one that has died. The first one, my grandmother had for a month and it stopped working. She got a return and received a new one and then that died. Now, my mother’s has died and is making a sizzling sound. Never buying a Panasonic microwave ever again."
1,"This microwave was delivered not even two months ago. We used it very lightly. Mostly for popcorn, etc. It has fewer than 10 total hours on it.We were using the microwave to melt butter in a Pyrex bowl, and it started making a slight rumbling sound. At first I thought the platter was not seated right, so I re-seated it, and started the microwave again. A couple of seconds later it was arcing like crazy. I unplugged it and took out the butter. And got a wonderful burning smell for a bonus."
5,IT's a great microwave and we have had no problems with it! I would highly recommend it.
1,"So not happy with this microwave. I spent quite awhile doing research, and thought this would be a great machine. When I tried to use it this morning, the number pad was nonfunctional for numbers 4-9 and I had to push very hard, and off to the side, of numbers 1-3.  I thought maybe it was just me, but my son could not get it to function properly either. We did heat up a cup of water using the beverage button, which did work, and I was dismayed at how loud the machine was when it was working. Also, due to the color of the door, even though there is a light inside when the microwave is in use, you can't see what is in there very well Terrible product, in my opinion, returning it immediately"
1,"Very surprised that this Microwave stopped working properly. Packaging allowed too much movement and the inner Toshiba Box had damaged corners. However, the return process was seamless.I ordered Toshiba again because I believe this to be a one -off in their packaging/delivery. Unfortunately, the replacement microwave also appears to be improperly packaged/delivered (on its side and no insulation was apparent between inner box and outer box. We're closely monitoring."
1,"It caught fire after 6 months of normal use.FIRE!I tried to get it ""fixed"" under warranty, but no one was available. They wouldn't let me ship it back and the local company that is listed to take it to evaded us- setting up appointments then not being in when we went to take it to them.Horrible experience. I'm never buying a Panasonic ever again."
2,Onyl gave two stars because the Microwave was way to small for my liking.Looked very good though. Never used it.
5,It is perfect. We were looking for a small microwave that would heat/reheat food decently. Of you're looking for something with a small countertop footprint it's great.
5,first brand new microwave after cheaping out over the years with buying used. i am very happy with this microwave and it's functions.
5,This is the perfect size for me. I'm single and have an efficiency
4,"a little noisy used a drop of oil on turn table and a lot disappointed that there was not a cookbook and not very good instructions, especially  for the air fryer."
3,"It is a solidly built unit which means its has slightly less room inside than it appears because of the thick walls/ceiling/floor.  It operates quietly, the door closes solidly, and it is reasonably attractive.  HOWEVER - Be advised that it does not have any instant minute buttons on the control panel.  It has the usual array of buttons for settings almost nobody ever uses, but YOU CANNOT POP IN A CUP OR BOWL OF SOMETHING AND JUST HIT THE BUTTON.  You have to punch the full minutes and seconds settings and then hit start. Secondly, the buttons do not depress with ease - you have to put a bit of pressure on them, so much so that the first few times I used it, I had to cancel and reset it because one or two of the digits didn't register when I pushed them lightly. Those two things strike me as stupid and poorly thought out.  What does it take to set the electronics to have an  instant minute or five or use a keypad that operates with a light touch?  The instant minute settings have been standard on every machine I've owned and used at friends for many years - but not on this one.  I'm going to try it for a couple days to see if I get used to it and just how inconvenient it really is, but I suspect it's going back despite it's good qualities.  Where was the keypad designed - outer Mongolia?Update:  The keypad has proven to be unmanageable for me.  The stop/start button does not clear the machine when you try to stop it.  You have to hit RESET to clear the machine.  If you hit stop/start twice in succession, it simply stops and then continues with whatever settings were used.  They're idea of CANCEL is evidently RESET. The instructions say to remove the protective material from inside the door.  Tech support at Curtis International (if I was understanding their garbled English correctly) said to leave the protective material in place.  The machine continues to smell like paint thinner when it is used.  The curtisint.com website provides very little help.  You must sign in with name and password to ask a question in the Q&A section, but I could find no place to sign up for an account. Keep your ORIGINAL RECEIPT because they demand that before dealing with you on a return or warranty repair.  Sound like an outfit you want to deal with?  I sure don't.  It's headed back to Amazon."
1,"I've only had this microwave for a few months and it already broke. It will not turn off unless you open the door, and it doesn't even heat anything when it does continuously run"
2,"I like this color & it works well, it’s just so loud when it starts."
5,"Heats food very quickly. Wonderful attachments, easy to clean. Great pricing. Have not used the hot air fryer feature."
5,The clock u have to wait for time to set up
3,"Works OK but i hate the small and intensive buttons.  hard to push, too small for old guy eyes and does not reset on stop."
1,"First off, I understand that this is a $50.00 microwave.  For this price, you don’t have much room to complain.  The microwave, while it functioned, was great.  It made food hot.  However, one day while heating up some food it started producing acrid electrical smoke.  Clearly a malfunction.  I called the manufacturer’s warranty line and got nowhere.  On my first call, I spoke to someone after an eternal hold and I was told that someone would contact me with further instructions.  No call back.  I called again a week later and left my number in the call back queue – no call back.  I repeated this exercise seven days later and still no phone call.  So my recommendation is that if warranty is not a concern, then buy this product as it works well.  But if it breaks while under warranty you are on your own."
3,It arrived very late through the US post office. I needed to replace my broken one during Thanksgiving to warm up left overs. Microwave this full size in WHITE are rare these days. Would buy again.
2,We’ve had our microwave for about 6 months with very minimal use. My daughter tapped the glass with her plate of spaghetti and this happened…. glass everywhere! I’d advise others to skip this for a more durable option.
5,Better than I expected.. the convection is amazing!I doubt I’ll ever turn on my big oven again
1,"Hey, I never leave reviews, but since this is a ""Top Seller"" and obviously has a serious manufacturing problem, people should know. Most of the 1 star reviews are about it shooting sparks and being incredibly dangerous. Well, I purchased this on July 23rd, 2018. After 13 month of light use, it started shooting sparks and flame out of the side panel as soon as you turn it on. We immediately unplugged it so it wouldn't malfunction further and burn our house down.Up until then, it was a great microwave. I wish I could still say the same.I came here to check on other reviews to see if my problem was some fluke and and saw that there are LOTS of other people that had this same problem. And every one of those bad review has a Toshiba rep copy/pasting a generic ""we're sorry, please contact customer support"" message. They''ll probably post one here as well. Even though I just got off the phone with them already and was told that they could do NOTHING for me being 35 days out of warranty. Good times.BUYER BEWARE! They're screwing something up and making a poor product and not standing behind it to make it right!"
5,Works well and looks nice .
3,"We where very excited to buy a product with healthy air fry. There is practically no infomration on air fry in the manualm Onnly one tiny button sayig air fry on the key pad. Which does litteThe key pad has many buttons, they are not lighted and very hard to see, even with glasses, I needed a flashlight to see themI have always liked this companies products but this on is over hyped"
5,"For a cheap microwave, it’s great. Not as powerful as our previous microwave. But it’s compact and still fits a full size plate."
2,"Had a issue with setting the kitchen timer after only having this unit about 45 days. Worked fine when I got it.  Support asked me to send a video of the problem(like they didn't believe me) and after I did they still didn't take care of the problem.  They seemed very confused and only showed me this back way to getting the kitchen timer to work properly. Other than that, it's a smaller, less powerful unit that will take about twice as long to warm up anything compared to the built in units, so be forewarned about that. When using the kitchen timer, you cannot perform any other cooking function.  All my previous microwaves allowed that."
5,Very compact microwave. It's smaller than my old one and doesn't take up as much counter space. It also fits great on my baker's rack. Works like it should and didn't blow a fuse (like my old one used to). Really needed this!
2,Great size for small kitchen- but most of the buttons don't work  at all
4,Looks and works great but is a little louder than expected. Definitely not disappointed.
3,"I live the look of the microwave and for the most part it works well. However, shortly after my 30 day return period was up it started shorting out randomly and the power cuts out and then turns right back on and we have to reset the clock and restart the microwave each time."
5,"Love this very simple, well apportioned, well made,  small microwave."
3,Very difficult to pop popcorn from a bag. Plus the cook time isn’t the easiest to figure out. It took my family 2 weeks to get to cook like they wanted.
1,"This product was defective. Two weeks after I received it, it suddenly wouldn't heat the food. There was an error code: H98: magnetron failure. User manual advised calling an authorized repair center. Fortunately I had saved the packaging and returned oven to Amazon for a full refund. I even called an electrician to check to see if there was a problem with the outlet or wiring. It was fine. I have owned a number of Panasonic products over the years and was pleased with all of them, until now. Now looking for another mid-sized countertop microwave."
3,Very small.  Does ok job.
5,Compact enough to fit in a camper.  Works good
3,"It works well, the handle is nice… it seems unnecessarily loud"
5,"Wonderful inexpensive microwave!!  I needed a sudden, unexpected replacement, so I needed to get something inexpensive.  This is perfect!!  It is a great size, works well, and didn't break the back right before Christmas time!!  My only complaint for the manufacturer is that the reset (clear) button is up by the numbers and sort of hard to find.  That is just a human ergonomics issue...not anything that affects its actual operation.  Really happy with this product."
5,So far we love this microwave. Just have to get used to where the buttons are because my old one had the Stop/clear button where they have the start button. I like the one touch options too. Easy to reheat leftovers.
3,"My use of a microwave oven is mostly for defrosting frozen food.  Fast and evenness in heating are the most important and the main criteria for selecting when buying this microwave.  I don't understand why the Panasonic microwave would be advertised as if power and evenness in heating is the most important feature of the product.  As it turned out, it is the opposite in actual use.  When defrosting frozen raw meat before cooking, it invariably gets a corner or the bottom cooked whereas other parts are still hard frozen.I did a test.  Break a raw egg in a bowl, add some water and whisk, to make a thin jelly.  The result is, no matter what, I simply could not get an evenly cooked egg jelly.  I thought the power level was too high, so set it low and stretched the time of heating, but the result is always overcooked on the edge around but the center is still liquid and never congeal.The same with heating, say, a refrigerated (i.e., not frozen) bowl of stew.  After heating, the bowl is so hot it burns my hand and I have to use a towel to take it out.  But when eating, the center is found to be still cold.Therefore sensor cooking and evenness of heating is not true as advertised.  Before this one I used a cheap microwave but evenness of heating was better than this Panasonic.  The solution is to defrost for a shorter time and do not open the door but leave the meat inside for some time to let the remaining heat inside the oven to gradually spread to the entire piece of meat (but this is not fast).  Or get the meat half defrosted in the microwave, then take the meat out and put it in warm water.  Or when defrosting fish, do not use microwave at all but warm water only.  These solutions are true of all brands of microwave I have used.  So Panasonic, weaker in even heating, please do not advertise sensor cooking and even heating."
2,"No me gustó ,lo quiero grande el problema es que voté la caja. No sé qué puedo hacer.Gracias M C"
3,"Stiff buttons that I hoped would loosen up after some use, but hasn't... still does the job well."
5,"This one is slightly smaller than the last one I had but it's perfect for me. I love that it's litterally one touch for most foods. The quick 30 seconds is my favorite button. The time was easy to set. It's fits regular size plates it just doesn't have alot of height. No tall cups but that's not an issue for me because I only heat up coffee cups and those aren't tall. This is great for small spaces, dorms, single people and even the office. Very happy with this. No issues, no complaints."
2,"This microwave heats food super fast... except in the middle of the platter.  And I don't mean it leaves the center of a big chunk of lasagne cold, I mean something flat like a slice of pizza ends up cold in the middle.  I have NEVER seen a microwave that fails to heat the middle of a slice of pizza before.For frozen dinners that require stirring in the middle of the cooking time, this almost always means you have to break up a big chunk of frozen food in the middle of the dish in order to stir it.  MUCH larger than in other microwaves I've used.The user interface is like something from the 90s.  To put it on half power you have to press the power button 6 times.  So, for example, to reheat a couple slices of pizza at half power for 4 minutes requires 10 button presses.  My last microwave (from 2004!) took 3.And if you accidentally put the time in before you set the power level you have to reset and start over.The ""Sensor Cook"" feature forces you to look up (or memorize) the correct ""recipe"" in the Sensor Cook Chart so you can enter its number.  This means I have to keep the manual (or a printout of the chart) on top of the microwave as a reference.  Really seems like we could come up with a better interface in 2019.It also lacks a ""beverage"" setting or recipe.So, all in all, it's not a TERRIBLE microwave, but if you want even heating or sensor cooking without needing a reference chart, I would look elsewhere.  If I had bought this at Costco I would return it, but having bought it here, it's not QUITE bad enough for me to package it back up to ship it back."
4,The tap controls are hard to read on the black background. Would like them to be illuminated.
5,Works great and it nicely designed.  Easy to clean.
4,"I got this microwave because i didn’t want to use up counter space for both a microwave and an air fryer. This isn’t really quite an air fryer, its more like an oven feature to crisp up food after microwaving, almost like a toaster oven would do. It works great with pizza, leaving it crispy instead of soggy like a typical microwave. Surprisingly i did find that it actually replaced my need for an air fryer in most cases. Though it takes a significant effort and experimentation to learn how long to put things in to get them to the right crispiness. Its also really heavy for a microwave, but i think most will not move it frequently so this probably a non issue. The mute button feature is great for reheating food for late night munchies and not having to worry about waking everyone up. Overall a really cool 2 in 1 microwave."
1,Llego todo golpeado
5,"Color is exact. Heats so well. A small mug heats a cup of water in just a minute, My old microwave did not heat as quickly. Really nice interior. I bought this with an amazon deal and used affirm to pay for it. Came out to $130 total was $109 plus taxes and the interest. So it's A little under $12 a month which I'll pay it off quickly. It's a really nice microwave. I think I made a good purchase. I'll know more in a couple months on it's durability. But it's made a good first impression."
5,"Arrived no damage...easy, quick setup...simple to operate...works prfectly"
5,"Smaller than what I expected but works great, easy to clean, light weight, perfect for a single person"
5,"I had a old Toshiba that finally gave out and after reading reviews purchased this newer one and I love it, alot better than my old one!One thing I will quickly say is I am iffy on whether or not the buttons will end up giving out early, all the function buttons work just fine but the number pad seems like it doesn't want to register touch alot where I have to push each number slowly or more than once to get it to work. Will update my review if this is the case and the numbers stop working.Other than that one issue this microwave is great! Larger than expected it's larger than a standard microwave but just means it's nice and roomy inside if you have to heat up a large dish. It is super quiet, the Humm was different than my old microwave but once I got used to that I could tell it was quieter. Also as soon as you open it the end time beep stops right away which I LOVE. Seems to heat up food a little better than my old microwave (same watt) I find myself taking 10-20 seconds off usual times. As long as the number keys hold up I would recommend!"
2,"I’m trying to be so patient with this microwave. When I received it, it took me about a week to use. The first day i used it I opened it and the light wouldn’t turn on. After opening and closing it a few times the light finally turned on. Then when I closed it and press the 1 minute button it counts down but doesn’t actually turn on or warms the food. The next day it started working for a few days then after that it does the exact same thing. So confused by this microwave I’ve never had one do this before."
1,so much condensation!!!!! it leaves a stream on my counter. returning
5,Heats up nicely
5,"1000 watts, red color matches kitchen, great product. Very quiet an easy to  clean."
2,"I purchased this one in 2020. Last year I noticed the peeling of coating on the inside. The door began acting wonky and wouldn’t set and catch properly. I would hear a sound of air running only to walk into the kitchen and see it on. It would be running but the timer wouldn’t count down so it wasn't putting out any heat.  I’m disappointed that going on three years in, I have to get a new microwave. For an appliance that’s not the best thing. I loved it at first."
4,Just too small but other then that it’s fine better for college or small apartment
4,"This is the loudest microwave in the world. If anyone knows a secret trick to lowering the volume, please respond to this post. I’m happy with the huge size and fast heating."
3,"Microwave works great! I wanted the Alexa connect ability and WIFI stuff. Why- IDK it is really useless, however, I wanted it. Super easy to connect to Alexa; I can ask it to run for 10 minutes or 30 seconds as I sit here typing this. But why? I'd still have to put something in it, right?!? The Alexa feature is cool but I haven't found a use for it yet.The Microwave works fine. Technology works fine. Here's my biggest grip..... It auto sets daily to the atomic clock If you have not heard of the Atomic Clock, google it. There is no daylight savings time with the movement of atoms.  I have to RESET the microwave clock almost EVERY DAY as it is a focal point for time. I have other ones in the kitchen but I've set up my kitchen for my use. AM stuff: coffee- look at microwave for time and microwave breakfast.  WOAH!!!!! I'm an hour late or early?Bottom line. The microwave is fine quality. I've had and used it for over 6 months. It adds (or maybe I add) extra stress to my life because the time is off and doesn't sinc with other clocks. Just letting you know!Maybe I'm just officially old."
2,"I purchased this micowave oven while I was waiting for a warranty replacement oven (another brand).The task of heating food takes twice as long to heat food.It was better than nothing,and the price was reasonable."
5,"We bought a GE fridge a while back and it's been great, so when we needed a washer and drier, we also got GE. Those have been great as well! Well..... Our Maytag Microwave bit the dust, so I found this little guy. We had limited space in our cabinets for a microwave, so it was either get one too big and put it on the counter under the built in space for a microwave, or get one that fits the hole. This one fits the hole, looks nice, doubles as a convection oven, and nukes leftovers nicely. The only weird thing is, it's quiet.... like super quiet.... like ""is it actually working?"" quiet. It works. Nuff said."
4,"We spent an extra $10 to get the WiFi one to use with our Alexa app. Thought it would be neat as we use Alexa daily for so many things. It arrived in a few days and was packed nice, no damage. Plugged it in and it works lovey. We followed the directions on the leaflet to connect with Alexa but it doesn’t work. She can’t seem to recognize it. After messing with it for a while both me and my husband decided it just wasn’t going to work with Alexa. The app you need to download it has a one star rating and everyone on there had the same things to say as we were dealing with. Infuse didn’t know if this app before buying and now that we have it we are keeping it. Maybe they will improve the app. The microwave is only stainless steel on the very front. I didn’t know this either as nothing else in my kitchen is black like the rest of the microwave. Another thing to consider if you want your appliances to match. The thing I love the most is the sound. I’m so used to a load and annoying microwave beep, or should I say BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP. This microwave has one nice little magical sound when the food is done. It’s very pleasant and I’m grateful someone has fixed that problem."
1,"Keyboard broke on first unit in 3 weeks. Amazon replaced.I should have gotten a refund instead - now 2 months later it is already breaking, just poor design, cheap membrane type.The user interface is also deficient, to set some time is takes 4 or 5 extra keystrokes than other microwaves I had in the past.Instructions for the convection portion are also poor. It works after you 'get' what they meant or after you call support, but still counterintuitive.My 24 yr old Sharp Carousel had the keyboard still working."
1,"We purchased this microwave to replace another Panasonic that developed some issues (which wasn't very old either). Big mistake. After just five (5) months of occasional use, the ""3"" and ""6"" on the keypad just quit working. To add insult to injury, the Panasonic support website doesn't work (won't accept either the model number or product category) and the chat website returns a DNS error. It's impossible to reach Panasonic online for help. Guess I won't be buying a Panasonic microwave again!"
5,but it works just like our big microwave replaced. only needed to add in a bit more time.
1,"The media could not be loaded.I bought this microwave last August and started having problems with it jamming in late July/early August, but I was still able to open the microwave at the time. This was until recently within the last few weeks that it doesn't open at all anymore. I reached out to customer service telling them this and they said that since I reached out a year after buying it, that it's out of warranty. I sent them this video and they did not care either. There is no reason for a microwave button to stop working a year into buying it, and to not work at ALL a year *and 2 months* after buying it. Ridiculous policy for kitchen appliances that should last much longer than a year. I won't be buying Black and Decker products again and I suggest you don't either. The short term savings is not worth buying another microwave in a year and two months because the moment a year passes they don't care anymore. I asked to have a new one sent to me and I'll return this one, nope. Now I have to buy a whole new microwave, and it won't be Black and Decker."
4,This microwave doesn't really heat food. It's not even a year old and the bottom of the microwave is peeling. It's not heating food up as quickly as it should. Look around you might find something that's better.
2,The unit works as it should but the ventilation is terrible.  The interior is covered with condensation after heating food for a minute or two which is something I have never seen in the other microwaves I have owned.  I have to leave the door open to dry the interior out.Update - 1 year and one month and it is dead. Even cheap microwaves I have bought in the past last 10 years or more.
5,"While remaining affordable, this is fantastic. I love the pull open door, especially after the button release on my last unit broke. I love the digit pad to be able to quickly and precisely set timers. I have not yet tried the Air Fryer, but the microwave and convection oven both work great! Can’t wait to try the Air Fryer!"
4,"This a good addition to a stainless steel kitchen with little countertop space.  The average countertop is 24 inches deep; since this oven is only 12 inches deep, you still have work space in front of it.  The inside is still large enough to fit a full sized plate with space to spare.  With the lower wattage, you have to add about 10 percent more cooking time to the usual time it takes to cook items.  The door is mirrored, so you cannot see inside the oven.  I would have given it 5 stars but they first one the company sent did not work.  However, the day after I sent the return request, the company overnight shipped a new oven without any questions."
4,Replaced an 1100 watt with this 700 watt. Takes some readjustment with cooking time but so far so good.
4,"The Microwave looks nice, smells nice (no odors at all), and appears to be very smart in all its functions, though I haven't tried them all yet.The One issue I had or the Microwave has is that the little legs or feet aren't the same size. It was rocking back and forth when touched because the ""left/front"" and ""right/back"" legs/feet aren't long enough to touch the Cart's surface. Since nothing could be done according to the company, Toshiba (I called them and asked; they suggested returning/replacing), I went against that idea because I hadn't yet tested the machine and it's too heavy (large box) and there are stairs to tackle. The UPS Driver was nice about bringing it upstairs but I doubt if he wants to take it back just because of too short legs/feet on the bottom of the machine and then return to delivered another to me.I found the simplest way to rectify the issue. I found a ""similar sized nut"" in my ""screws and things drawer"" and put black electrical tape around the sides of it, then I tested which leg/foot would work best supported by it and the right/back leg turned out to be the best place to put it. I also put a rubber-like mat that goes on shelves underneath the microwave to keep it from sliding on the Cart's surface when the door is being opened and closed. Everything worked like a charm, problem solved; no more rocking or sliding.I tested the Microwave out and found it to be VERY Nice on the Sound and the standards of operation. I read the manual to check out all that it will do and the Air Fry and Convection Options look like something I will try at some point once I get the nerves and know exactly what I want to try to cook with those Options.I'm happy with the purchase, except I noticed that the price went down $21.00 right after I purchased it. I ordered it on April 2, 2022 and received it on April 7, 2022 and not happy to see the price decrease. In some stores, if that happens within a week you can get the difference if you find out and go ask for it with your receipt showing the difference, I've had that happen three times before in my life (a refrigerator, a stove and a winter coat). I don't think Amazon.com goes by that philosophy. Oh, well."
3,Love that it connects to the Alexa when I am cooking multiple things. But it burns popcorn Every Single Time and I can’t change the programming to make it not burn. But that is the only reason I can’t give it more stars.
4,"I loved this microwave until it stopped responding to Alexa commands after two weeks of use. I have tried everything I know to do to fix this problem and nothing works. It is connected to my wi-fi, my MSmartLife app and paired with my Alexa app. I have tried unplugging it, deleting the apps and reinstalling them and it still will not respond to Alexa commands. It responds to touch commands from the MSmartLife app on my phone, so I know it is connected. Every time I use a voice command however, Alexa says ""ummm, the microwave is not responding"". Very frustrating as this feature is what convinced me to buy the microwave in the first place. Everything else works fine, but not being able to use it with Alexa is disappointing.I am editing my review to say that the microwave randomly started working with Alexa again and now it is responding to my voice commands. I am adding a couple of stars because I love the microwave now. It is perfect for my kitchen. I just hope it continues to keep working with Alexa."
1,"The BLACK+DECKER Digital Microwave Oven is a sleek addition to my kitchen with its modern design. Its digital interface is user-friendly and makes heating food a breeze. The variety of power settings allows for precise control over cooking, which is great for someone like me who appreciates a well-cooked meal. The size is perfect for my countertop, and it’s easy to clean. I was really looking forward to using the BLACK+DECKER Digital Microwave Oven, but unfortunately, it never arrived. My experience with Amazon's customer service while trying to resolve the delivery issue was less than satisfactory. It took quite a while and several exchanges to reach a resolution, which was not in my favor as they denied a full refund for unclear reasons. It's unfortunate as I had high hopes for this purchase and the support from Amazon. Overall, it is a functional and aesthetically pleasing appliance that lives up to its brand's reputation."
3,"This it specifically states it is a ""healthy air fry"". It is not! This is one of the most important features that caused us to order this model. We are very disappointed, and if anyone wants this feature...do not order. We feel that there should be some sort on compensation for this incorrect advertisement."
1,"Awful, the deviceMoves at the slightest touch, has zero wait to it, closing and opening it is like opening the 16 year rusted garage door, barely fits a small dinner plate, barely warms anything bigger than a meatball, a bag of microwave popcorn doesn’t even fully rotate Inside(burnt popcorn no matter what), the rotation plate never ever stays on track and flies off at every possible moment. Honestly should have known better than to get a black and decker product. Their line of items are cheap and a waste of market space.Save yourself the hassle, get something better!"
4,liked the size and ease of use.
5,Not a whole lot to say. It works like a microwave should work and it's a good size for minimal kitchen bench space.
5,"I love that it cook's every meal evenly through, and whatever food you place in the  microwave you have put it on a lower time because it get's your food hot quick."
4,This has got to be the smallest microwave made lol but it’s fine for my needs. Not sure why the maker made it so weird to use. Lots of buttons and you need the instruction book to figure out how to use it. But great color and very cute
1,Stopped working within 2.5 years! Very disappointing.
4,"It's a space saver replacing several of my other appliances.I've used the microwave and air fryer-both are good. My attempt a broiling was so-so. Needs a good wipe down after broiling and probably the same for baking. Not unusual.In my tiny kitchen, the counter is on the left, set in behind stove. This is the only place the appliance fits. But the door on this opens from the right. It makes it harder to get food in and out and harder to clean without contortion. It would be nice to have the option of which way the door will open.From other reviews I knew the settings panel was hard to read. It is! I have to use a flashlight to see the settings. Why? My other appliances had bold white and were easy to read and it was a cheap little microwave. This isn't.  I can live with it, just seems like an easy fix.The setting panel is not intuitive. And this appliance didn't come with instructions. I downloaded the pdf but the instructions are a jumbled mess. Worse is having to go back and forth online to read them. Please consider sending an instruction booklet with this.If it came with instructions; if it had an option of the door opening on the other side; if it had a readable setting panel. . . it would be perfect.An addendum, love it for baking and for one or two, the size is perfect without heating up a large oven. One thing I noticed while baking cookies, need to set the time less or the temperature about 25 degrees lower. Worked fine after some adjusting."
3,It's a great microwave for a great price but the microwave makes a loud noise when it's running.
3,It doesn't have enough power. Everything takes longer. That is my fault for not reading the wattage. Otherwise it's great
2,Instructions don't explain how to use the air fryer.  And that's the feature we bought the unit for.Is there a separate manual?On-line manual doesn't explain air frying either.This is a glaring hole in the instruction manual.
4,Nice micro does all the things it us supposed to do. Easy to operate..
5,It's easy an convenient
4,Its a microwave. It waves at your food till its hot. Only down side is the film covering on the buttons has warped quickly from basic use.
1,This product quit working in 4 months.  Don't buy it!  It's horrible.
5,"Durable, great presets, great purchase"
1,It took it return before the thing inside it truned black and smell bad:(
5,This is a great microwave.  Fits great on the countertop.  There are quite a few presets so you don't have to guess how to warm up your various foods.  It turns so your food gets pretty evenly warmed up and the glass plate inside is easy to clean if you overcooked something and it exploded all over the microwave.  Great buy!
1,"I only write reviews when a product exceeds my expectations or when it is plain horrible. Unfortunately, this one is horrible and unsafe to boot. Purchased the first one in January 2019. After 3 months the interior light started to flash when the microwave was in use and continued flashing when the door was open. Customer service was moderately responsive, confirmed the microwave was defective and issued a refund (after I jumped through a few hoops and waited for four weeks to receive the refund).  I ordered a second one because the first fit our space, was quiet and easy to use and clean, did a reasonably good job at warming food evenly, was priced right, had so many positive reviews,  and I figured the chances of receiving a second defective unit was probably not great. Well, I was wrong. Today, the second unit started doing exactly the same thing, three months into using it. I have yet to have customer service confirm a refund and I have to replace the darn thing again. I will NOT be buying another Toshiba, now or ever."
5,Me encanto solo que no es para espacios reducido es fácil de limpiar y usar
3,No instructions that really explain how it works. Does however work well when I guess right. Food is not dried out and chewy like my old mic cooked.
3,"Disappointed,; it's heavy; it's noisy.  I'm going to trade it for a much smaller one--hopefully, my friend will go for trade.  I probably made the mistake because all I do is heat coffee, make popcorn and heat frozen dinners.  The turntable doesn't seem to fit well."
5,"I was widowed last year and no longer wanted or needed  a 2 cu.ft. microwave that took a large amount of counter space and was too big for my dedicated microwave shelf.There is a small learning curve as to be expected when changing manufacturers of a specific type of product. The size is sufficient to hold a large dinner plate and my even larger round prep board. The size and power should be perfect for even a 4 person household. Though I haven’t owned for very long, so far, I’m pleased with my purchase."
1,"I really only use MW for reheating things and defrosting. So I was disappointed when using this Microwave to defrost a pound of ground beef using their Inv Turbo Defrost setting as directed. Inside was ice and the outside was cooked.  Tried again with a pork roast. Same result. Contacted Panasonic and after 4 letters they sent me a box so I could return it, postage free. I did that, and got it back 3 weeks later. They sent me the same microwave ( I had fixed a small piece of scotch tape to the outside and it was still there) and the defrost still doesn't work. Just have to use Power 3, and guesstimate the minutes. Sorry I bought this brand."
2,"I will say the function of this microwave is great. I haven't had any trouble with that. However, when I was cleaning it today I noticed that the paint coating inside is already starting to peel. It's inside but on the front at the bottom where the door is closed against it. It ended up peeling off a huge chunk leaving behind visible metal that's now flaking what looks like rust. I bought it in November of 2019 and it is now January of 2021. I don't think I should have to be buying a brand new microwave already because the protective coating is peeling off. But here I am."
4,Setting functions or using time setting buttons on control pannel must be held a long time before accepted and displayed on unit.  All other unit options are great to use.
1,"Purchased this microwave in October 2020 and it has started making a HORRIBLE grinding noise now when I turn it on. Open the door, close it, start it again and sometimes it does it and sometimes it doesn't - makes no sense at all. Very disappointed to have paid this much for a microwave that had problems so early on. Worried it will short out or just stop working all together based on other reviews that had the same issues."
4,"Very pleased with this microwave.  My only suggestion would to ask the manufacturer to put instruction stickers on the inside of the microwave like most other brands do.  The defrost feature is what I use mostly, but there are no directions other than what is in the Owners Booklet as to how the settings work.  Otherwise, it does the job."
5,Great compact micro wave.  Heats food and does as is expected.  Good packaging.  Great value.  I highly recommend this item.
4,"I was happy from the time I unpacked my new microwave because it was packed well but easy to open and easy to understand directions for use.  I had to get used to not being able to see the numbers on the front without putting on a light.  My previous microwave was white with black numbers, which I could see using the light from the next room.  Now that I'm used to it, I can select the time by rote but keep a small flashlight next to the unit.  I like the quiet running sound and can turn off the alert beeps if I need to, and I like the way it cooks my food.  No complaints and I was thrilled to be able to replace a kitchen appliance for less than $100.  I think this is a good buy and hope it keeps cooking well for a very long time."
3,The clock part of this microwave does not work but not worth the hassle of returning it .
3,Bought Dec 2019. Worked good until  Dec 2022. Then it srarted throwing sparks so I threw it out. Only one person used this  microwave. I just think it should have lasted longer.
2,"I got this to use while my stove/oven was out of commission and air fryer was packed for my move, it's getting me by, but it's not the air-fryer i was hoping for, their ""crispy pan"" is solid, preventing air from circulating around the food so it's much WETTER than a normal air-fry and i haven't gotten anything to brown or crisp up at all, even experimenting without that pan (baked goods). (yes, I could broil it, but I shouldn't have to!)It also occasionally gets stuck at the ""done!"" beep after non-microwave functions, and won't stop no matter what I press, until i pull the plug. taking a star off for that.But it's doing all things right now, if not necessarily WELL, and the price is similar to a decent regular microwave, so i'll be keeping it...and relegate it back to regular microwave, when i get my regular stove and air fryer set up!  woohoo!"
4,"Too small for my 11.5 inch diameter plates. The door opening is about 10 3/4 inches wide. Slightly larger plates can fit through if tipped sideways. I could set my 11.5 inch diameter plates flat on the rotating plate, but no matter how carefully I tried to center them one side always rubbed the wall of the microwave during cooking. It is too bad because it looks great and does indeed fit into a very small space."
3,"RCA RMW733-BLACK Microwave Oven, 0.7 cu. ft., BlackThe sizes are off. for this model its about an inch less tall (about 10.25 tall), and an inch less wide(around 18.25 wide, maybe a little less). seems to work as advertised, I was just expecting something that fit the space that I have better"
2,"This microwave was fine until it started coming on by itself. Can you imagine? Six months old and it just started up in the middle of the night. Not happy about it. Can it be dangerous? I'm seeing if it's still under warranty, because this isn't right."
2,"Very disappointed with this purchase. It has no light, the turntable comes off it's trolley constantly, and food cooks unevenly."
4,"The microwave take up a lot of counter top space, but it works well. The instructions are difficult to understand, but once you get how it works, its easy to control. The connection to Alexa isn't the greatest. I honestly didn't think I would use that feature, but I find myself using it all the time."
1,Only two months in and getting a loud buzzing/shorting out on the inside right of the microwave.  Trash.
3,I can't read the control panel. Print is small and if this product isn't in great light you can't see the panel. The on off button isn't marked as such. All in all I don't like this product. Too hard to use.
5,"I've had this for about 2 months now.  I needed a small microwave.  It was perfect, and the stainless steel woke up my kitchen a bit.  Believe it or not, my old white one was still working after 25 years! It was disgusting though.  It was my first microwave! Yup, I was quite late to the microwave movement. Like everything else.  I still have an Iphone 6. Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
5,"Love this microwave, it has a few unexpected features much better than our old one that I really like such as…When it's done it beeps to let you know. And that's it, no incessant beeping at regular intervals to remind you. I used to hate that about our old microwave.I like the one touch settings. Especially the 30 seconds if you hit the start button. Very handy.I didn't like the blue LED at first, as everything else in our kitchen is green, but I don't mind it now.I really like the curved metal handle it's quite elegant compared to other models.Sorry about the crappy photo… But hey it's just a microwave. Buy it you won't be disappointed."
5,"This is possibly the quietest microwaves I have every used. No buzz, no clunking, no insanely loud beeps. Just a slight, sweet hum. The first time I heating something up I wasn't even sure that it was fully on!The microwave heats up thoroughly, looks good, and is easy to use. I haven't found any flaws so far!"
2,"Magnetron died in less than 2 years. Didn't support daylight savings time, had to change clock time manually every day. Not a Toshiba btw, it is made by Midea and supported by them."
1,"Only lasted 2 years with normal use-warming foods up mainly. Will not turn off after food is done. When door is opened, keeps running. Contacted farberware customer service. Told me only has one year warranty so can't do anything. I said that means I will have to get rid of because its a hazard to use. He agreed and then told me to have a good day. WILL NOT BE PURCHASING ANYMORE FARBERWARE PRODUCTS!!"
1,"We bought this in November, and today 2/13/23 it sparked and caught on fire! I guess I am pass the return date! BE CAREFUL!!"
5,"only annoying thing--partly because my previous one had ""push button opening""--is that door has to be pulled open physically...."
5,"Beautiful,fits perfectly on my counter and great value."
4,My microwave died and I finally had to replace it this one it seems to be a lot more louder with a different tone but I guess that’s part of the deal the more you pay the choir you get is working out just fine for me though and my wife
1,"After a month and half it stopped working, wont come on. I did use it that often and did clean iot when i was done but one day i went to use it, it had no power no lights, no time or anything showing. It was just dead. It was extremely  oud to use and i time made me worry if it was gonna blow up. Just a month and a half Later it stopped. I bought it on May 30th.I had to replace my old one cause after 4 years it was on its last legs. So i tried to get the best microwave i could for the best price. Like I said only complaint i had about was being noisy. Now im thinking that it may be the reason it quit. It was delivered like that. It didnt just start being noisy after i got it, it already sounded that way. I doubt Ill be able to get another or a refund from Amazon. And sadly I dont have time or money to be able to buy another microwave. That was paid for by my  stimulas check. Thanks amazon."
2,"Well thought maybe one reviewer just got a dud but lo and behold, the select display is so light, we have to use a battery operated light to see it so we can select what we want.  Of course the clock is lighted, big and bold!  When I say light, I’m saying why did you bother at all!  Just day 1 of use so want to use to provide appropriate revues in due time but seriously, GE, fix this issue for your future customers.  It’s such a slap in the consumer’s face!!!"
3,"If you’re going to purchase this microwave, don’t ever walk away and let it run. Fortunately I was standing nearby when my microwave lit on fire after just 1 minute of heating something. It happened the first week I owned it, but I wrote it off to “maybe it was the container” (it wasn’t).I went on to use it for another year and a half or so, but then it started on fire again 2 days ago - an actual fire inside, this time there was what looked like smoke coming from the ceiling of the unit. Yes, I had to try it again to be sure, and again, fire (unit was clean inside).I’m surprised they’re still selling this, but please, if you do purchase it — please don’t ever walk away while it’s running. I was standing nearby each time or it could have set my entire house on fire."
2,"This was a great combo use convection/microwave while it lasted. After 1 year the convection function stopped working. Now, it's just a microwave. Hope you have better luck."
1,"To light, you have to hold the unit to open and close it, otherwise the no sound feature is nice"
5,"This review is for Farberware Classic FMO07AHTBKJ 0.7 Cu. Ft. 700-Watt Microwave Oven with LED Lighting.The unit shipped without shipping related issues.I personally never use this or any other microwave for cooking, but other family members do and they like it.  The supplied fan in this unit doesn't seem as effective in removing moisture as our previous units.I like and use the timer several times a day, so I am really happy for that.It is not the least expensive option in this size and power category.  But if one wants the look or the features then it's okay.Based on my experience of recycling microwaves as a hobby, it doesn't really matter which brand is chosen since the guts of the units are made by two manufactures and every one else basically installs the working bits inside their box and slaps their logo on it.  So the decision comes down to looks and features and price point.Setting aside sloppy manufacturing practices, they should all last about the same length of time and perform about the same."
5,Very durablevery durable
4,worked as advertised. Very happy with purchase decision.
1,the display surface is like plastic wrap. it bubbles and peels off. There is actually no way to file a warranty claim even though it says it had a 1 year warranty. Farberware is two different companies and in the US their microwaves seem to be run by a shell company that has no contact info and the Farberware that makes glassware disavows all knowledge of microwaves in the US. farberware microwaves has a website that has no contact info or way to request contact.
5,"I like this microwave very much.  I especially love the ""crisp"" setting which allows me to heat pizza without having to turn the whole oven on for crispy pizza.  It fits well on my counter and the controls are easy to use."
3,"Microwave lasted a 1yr 3mth (peeling/ corrosion. I would suggest adding a warranty, when purchasing this product."
1,"Received this and it had a dent in the front but decided to try and use it anyway. This microwave was SUPER noisy and after attempting to use it, it tripped the GFCI it was plugged into. Tried several different outlets in the kitchen and same issue. Returned this ASAP and bought a Panasonic that has performed flawlessly."
4,"This is an excellent convection microwave, with everything working as it should...it does an especially great job in defrosting  without cooking the food compared to my previous  microwaves...and the combi function really works well, letting you cook a 5 lb chicken moist with crispy skin ...the only drawback is it does take a long time to preheat in convection...about  15 min to get to 350, so much longer than most countertop ovens."
2,"This microwave is so tiny! I should of bought the next size up! Also the bottom of this microwave has no grip! It slides around the counter top and almost fell off once! I had to buy a rubber matt to put under it so it wouldn't move! It does heat the food good, I will give it that!"
1,"Update:  I misjudged GE. I spoke today with Customer Relations, and the rep I spoke with said they were already working on the complaint I submitted this morning. They wanted to pay to get a repair person to look at it, but when they discovered I live in Portland, Maine, where they have no service people, they said after I sent them my original sales receipt and a photo of the microwave with the cord cut off, they would send me a check for the original cost I paid, and I could put that toward another microwave! I am very satisfied with the way GE handled my complaint about this issue.Update: June, 2018: The replacement microwave I purchased has had no other fires. However, last month the fan started running all the time so that I had to unplug the machine to get it to turn off. I was able to continue to use the microwave and it still worked just fine when I wanted to heat something, but it was troublesome when I had to plug it in each time I used it. The electrical outlet was behind the microwave so at first we were pulling the machine forward to plug it in and use it each time. We finally moved it to a less convenient location. After calling GE they sent us a refund for the amount we paid for the second microwave. The refund was great, and I was pleased to receive it so we purchased the same GE microwave again since the thing fits our space, but I don't know if I would recommend this device if you have another choice. I love the features and the look and especially the size, but maybe microwaves need to be bigger than this one to last longer. I don't know.Original review:  I purchased this microwave one year ago and absolutely loved it at first. If I reviewed it then, I would have given it five stars. It fit perfectly in our tiny kitchen, but at the same time the turntable at 10.5"" was large enough to accommodate our dinner plates. Although the machine was small in size, it was surprisingly powerful and nicely designed. I loved that I could still heat up things while the timer was running. (I sometimes have trouble doing two things at once myself so I thought my microwave was pretty brilliant.)Then, after about 6 months, when heating something for one minute, I saw a flame light up inside the oven. I wondered if there was metal hidden in the ceramic bowl I heated the food in. It never happened again until last night (7 months later) when I was melting some butter in a glass bowl, again for only one minute. There was a strange noise as soon as I turned on the machine, and I again saw a large flame come from the wave guide cover. Since I am certain this time there was no metal to cause a spark, I do not want to use this microwave again.I purchased it 13 months ago so it is probably no longer under warranty. I filled out the complaint form on GE's website, but I expect the company will say I need a service call which GE will most likely expect me to pay for. Even if someone tries to assure me it has been safely repaired, I know I will never trust the machine again. I do not want it in my house.  It is a frustrating and scary development, so I am back to Amazon looking for a new small microwave that is not a GE. And I am trying to figure out how to dispose of this fire hazard."
1,When I received it the plastic ring for the turn table had a wheel broken. It probably cost 50 cents.  I called RCA  and they were like robots.  I had to email all the info about the unit and myself.  Then  came 3 more emails. All of them were identical. I got fed up and then called customer service at Amazon and within 5 minutes my I was given permission to return it Amazon. I bought a different brand and it was delivered in 2 days. Don't buy RCA. Pay a little more and save yourself a migraine
