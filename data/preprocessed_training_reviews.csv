2,"I purchase for the Brand since have had many items that just seem to do well for me.This is a disappointment functionally for two reasons -1) IT SLIDES all over the counter.

Until this product I never needed to turn the big light on in the Kitchen AND put on my glasses. Now I do.The noise put me off a bit when first started up - startled me.All of my other Microwaves, ever, had a fan noise and more of a higher pitch, light hum to it. This one is to me, 3x's as loud, with a low, very textured buzz (not a hum a buzz, buzzing - heavy running sound).It's not the least expensive, not the most costly and since I find price is not always, or even usually an indicator of ""good/not-good"" - I went with brand and reviews.I did read the, or see the reviews that state the same as I say now - NOW I understand - but just didn't ""get it"" until today - wow - what to do.Otherwise, the controls are somewhat intuitive.The times to heat are about the same or the same as on my 1200 watt unit or the prior 900 watt unit. I felt that there was no need to use that much wattage to heat water, or warm food, etc.I was anticipating the inside dimensions being ""tight"", but remain functional for what I experience with other units. So, what I mean, as e.g., is like - I'd love to heat 3 slices of Pizza same time one place as with the room or power with the 1200 watt unit. However, I often wind up doing two or even one slice in order to over all just heat the slice versus getting very ""spotty"" hot/cold not evenly warmed. Slight overlaps of slices never works and actually have burned things when got jammed/not rotate. So, the smaller footprint would seems as a non-issue, or better this way. HOWEVER, as the Manual says, allow for THREE INCHES all around this unit when using, placing it. So, it may not ""functionally"" be a small a footprint as you imagine if don't have that for air/heat which you need to take *seriously!So, anyway, it's a microwave. The door looks safe, will remain safe I hope, not sag, loosen up, etc., ""leak"" as is the warning concerning the - Door. However again, the Non-back lit Control Labels, small font/type and thin/light/hard to see AND that now I have to figure a way to keep it from SLIDING ALL OVER my counter top - SO DANGEROUS even for ""Adults"" - WOW. I looked in the box for some anti-slide thing not installed - none. I mean - where - is a Microwave EVER INSTALLED that is on a NON-SMOOTH, easy to clean, sanitize surface - ""sliddy""? Where - Black+Decker?In my opinion, that miss the mark for what I would otherwise, as first use rate would rate otherwise, 4 or even 5 stars. Then the Buzzing when running thing - is likely something that could be addressed. As with many things I see today now usually has to do with lowering the cost of manufacturing. I deal with mechanical audio and ""hear"" what they've done versus could do to quiet it down substantially.So, I hope that assists someone. Additionally, all in can say if Sliding is an issue, Small Control Labels, and Noise is an issue - take those Reviews to heart to consider - those are issues and wish I did. Yes, I could return it and may - we'll see. Who's to say what the others may be like - so... how much time to spend on this.

1,"I don’t understand the number of positive reviews. Here is my honest reflection after having had this microwave for 3 months. I talk about the following below: (1) low power, (2) lingering smell, and (3) useless turntable.(1) Low Power. When I say low, I mean it can’t heat one cup of room temperature water in a mug. We had a much better built in microwave in our previous house and needed to buy a new one since our new house didn’t have one built in. We got this one for the small foot print. Unfortunately, it takes us more than twice the amount of time to heat foods and beverages as compared to our last one.(2) Lingering Smell. If you heat anything in there with any type of scent, be prepared to either leave the door open (and therefor the light on) overnight for the smell to dissipate or live with eating or drinking the scent of whatever was in there prior. If you heat fish, forget about using it for another day. I’ve used it to heat salmon one night and opened it up to heat a cold cup of coffee mid morning the next day only to be met by the most foul scent that can only come from old fish odor. Btw, i clean my microwave daily and it’s spotless so it’s not from food splatters.(3) the turntable is a piece of glass that sits on top of a loose plastic ring with three wheel and the whole thing slides ALL OVER THE PLACE. There are three grooves at the bottom of the glass turntable that is supposed to catch the center turning mechanism in the microwave. However, that will only happen if you precariously balance it in such a way that doesn’t slide around on the wheeled ring thing AND is perfectly situated in mismatched grooves. A hair off and the whole thing slides around again.I wish I had the time and energy to send this back when I still have the chance. Do yourself a favor and pass.",False

1,"I bought this to replace my current small microwave that would not fit my Dr. Brown bottle sterilizer.

In fact the only way to fit the sterilizer is to remove the carosel plate and angle it in just right.  The actual door opening is only 11” wide x 6 7/8” high. If the carosel is installed it’s only about 6 1/4” high.  Depth is only 10 1/4”.  Note there is a bump back in the back and the side but still nowhere near the advertised interior dimensions.  This is very disappointing when you are buying it to fit specific items.  Please include accurate dimensions.  Tell people the real product interior dimensions  11” wide x 6 1/4” height x 10 1/4” depth!Update******Fire hazard-  now after less than two years it’s a fire hazard, it shorts, arch’s and smokes if you try to heat any frozen food in multiple known microwave safe containers.
