2,"Looks nice, perfect size and effective."
2,"Internal specifics see below lead you to believe cavity will hold aup to 12 inch plate not the case our 10.5 inch plate would not fit in the cavity. ""Internal dimensions: 12.05” x 11.97” x 8.11” (W*D*H)"" it's there statement on the site."
3,Takes a really long time to heat up any food. Things that normally take 2-3 minutes tops takes 5 to 6 minutes.
3,Small compact keyboard unlit not visible in the dark  You have to hold it down from sliding when operating keyboard.  I’m up grading very soon.
2,Weak! The things I used to cook in 3 minutes now take 6 minutes.. this micro has no power
1,"Not a good microwave.  After I set it up and plugged it in.  Put a tv dinner in it and it started to smoke.  Thinking maybe something was wrong with the TV dinner, I tried something else and it smoked also."
1,"Reliability is a huge issue, broke after half year of light use."
2,"I bought this October 2021.Paint is bubbling, then chipping.I guess I should make sure there are no sparks!!!!"
1,"I bought this microwave to use at work and would only use it 2-3 times per week, if that, and it completely stopped working after only having it for only 2.5 years. 1 year of those 2.5 years it was never used because I wasn’t at work, due to covid. I should of listened to all the reviews, stating that it just stops working! Such a waste, just to go to a landfill. My parents have had the same microwave for almost 30 years and it still works perfectly, nothing is made to last anymore!"
2,"It seems to me they should make the top higher. The inside space is small. It is low power, but that's okay because the benefit is that it draws less current. I don't like bigger ones because of that.Update: After using this 700W model for a while, I find that pressing the buttons is annoying. They are black and hard to see, and finding the right spot to press is pretty difficult. Plus, the door is hard to open as others have said."
3,Pretty good microwave. Serves its purpose and not horrible to look at it
2,"Underpowered, takes 2x longer than other microwaves. Not recommended."
2,The display is broken. The lights for the first two digits don't show.
3,"This microwave would probably work well if you are worried about tripping a breaker but for normal, household use, buy a different model. 700W is not very powerful. For instance, It took over 8 min to heat up a package of vegetables that steam in a bag (it normally takes 4 min in the larger ones)That being said, it is compact and easy to use. It is clearly marked 700W. If you’re retired (like me) and have extra time to wait for something to heat up, this microwave may be ok for you. If you’re like my wife/kids and impatient, habitually late or in a hurry, you’ll need something with a lot more power (like 1200W)."
1,"Control panel defective, item returned when seller’s customer service said that was normal. Item returned."
3,"Cheap, wobbly -- doesn't heat evenly. Inside little square part is dark yellow burnt stain and will not come clean...."
2,A couple months in and this thing is already dying. It is also quite anemic - it is advertised as 900w but is probably closer to 600w.
2,"It’s smaller than I expected.  It may work well for a dorm, but not fir using dinner plates.☹️"
3,Love it but when it gets too hot it makes these long beeps. Don't know how to stop it. But great for it's price
1,The buttons do not work on the control panel. Some of the buttons intermittently worked the first few days then got progressively more frustrating and have now completely stopped working.
3,It’s a microwave. It works. What else is there to know?
1,This actually came in damaged. When taken out the pieces just came off and the top is clearly bent and we can’t put the touch pad in because the plastic inside is broken and won’t sit correctly because of being bent
1,"I would not recommend this microwave.I bought the microwave less than a year ago and it recently broke. Specifically, it sparked while baking a simple potato on a plate. Luckily, I was next to the device as a small fire was starting and immediately stopped it. I’ve never experienced a product malfunction in this manner.Furthermore, what’s almost more disappointing is that my experience with customer service was awful. After the incident occurred, I called the company to explain the situation. I was told someone would contact me to rectify the situation, but it’s been weeks. I’ll update this review accordingly if I hear back from customer service and the matter is resolved."
1,"I never got to use it , when i received it was all dented up, and i couldn't use it"
1,"The media could not be loaded.For some reason, this microwave completely shuts down when overworked (more than 5 minutes).  It makes one clicking sound and then powers off completely.  No digital display, no oven light, nothing.  Overheating maybe?  Right side of microwave gets hot.  I guessing some sort of fuse is being triggered.  Comes back to life after several minutes.  Will work for light duty microwaving for a minute or 2.  Otherwise, avoid this piece of junk."
1,"So small that a plate barely fits. The plate in comes with constantly moves around and it won’t settle in the middle. Takes forever to heat up! It takes about 10 mins to get a small bowl of soup to warm up.  Too late to return, but I will be trashing it and buying a new microwave."
2,"We moved from a house with a built-in microwave to one without. We needed a small countertop microwave for things like melting butter and reheating leftovers. Maybe it's unfair to compare this microwave to a built-in, but it takes three times as long to heat something. We are also having an occasional problem with ours where it will kind of freak out when you try to input time, and it makes the beep tone and won't stop. Pressing keys doesn't do anything. Unplugging it helps, until the next time it happens. We've only had it about six weeks, which seems to be par for the course with mass produced, made in China electronics."
3,"I think this is a little too compact and too weak for regular use. Bought this because my standard one went out of commission.I stilll have it because I use it lol and it works, but ideally something slightly larger and more powerful would be better."
1,It doesn’t heat well the tray never stays on right. It looks like it overheated in side as it had dark marks it has chipped all within 2 years. Do not buy. I usually do not leave reviews but this one was so awful I had to warn people.
3,The inside enamel broke and started peeling after about 2 years. I needed a small microwave due to space constraints. Was very disappointed considering the good name this was labeled with. I expected more from Black and Decker.
3,"Pros: Good power, fits into the space I have. Cons:  1) The glass plate has notches that fit into corresponding notches on the bottom of the unit, but the fit is not tight enough. The plate easily becomes unstable with heavier foods on top of it. 2) The beeper sounds 5 times, even if I've opened the door and taken out the food. 3) The light stays on until I close the door. If I leave the door ajar, the light stays on until I close the door. 4) The smaller interior cavity means that fewer items can fit into the space. My past microwave fit into the same small space I have, but it had a larger cavity."
2,The volts are to low!  Takes twice or more as long to cook per instructions!  Not worth the money!
3,There is not sufficient ventilation for moisture to escape.  I'm tired of having to use several paper towels to wipe out down the entire interior every time I heat something moist.  It's unfortunate because I liked the small size a lot.
1,"This microwave literally blew up when my husband plugged it in the wall. Each time I tried to return this broken, defective product, the site would direct me to watch a video on how to fix the problem, rather than allow me to return this non-usable item. I teach and intended to take it to my elementary school. I am grateful I did not take this dangerous appliance around my students I am out money and very disappointed at the complete lack of customer service.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MICROWAVE!"
3,It’s too small. I bought it for popcorn but the microwave popcorn bag is too big and it doesn’t work properly. Very frustrating.
1,"Single person light usage with meticulous cleaning with no chemicals…..this is what happened after a year and a half.  Black n Decker support frustrating having me send repeated multiple documentation to then tell me it is out of warranty.  They sometimes make exceptions, they said, but not in this case.So far, extended warranty won’t cover it either.Update:  Asurion warranty stepped up..yay.  Still disappointed with BlackNDecker and will NOT buy again."
2,"This microwave is very small, it works fine but smaller than expected"
1,"This has been a decent microwave oven until it lasted. It is not powerful, but you get used to it. The reason for the one star review is longevity of the product. It died exactly two months after the 2 year warranty expired. I was expecting more from Black & Decker. Now when I turn the microwave on, there is flame inside, very scary noise and burnt electric smell. So it goes to the garbage, but was good during its short lifespan of 2 years and 2 months of service,"
2,The picture is misleading. The one for the price is not that big
3,"I thought It was low wattage when I bought It, amazon advertises 700 Watt, but in reality, It consume 1200 watt."
1,"This is the worst microwave (probably appliance, overall) I've ever owned. It takes 4 minutes to heat a cup of coffee, and is super small. The turning plate falls off the stabilizer everytime I use the microwave. I got rid of my old microwave because Black and Decker has never disappointed me, and I regret it immensely."
2,"After the paint/lining failed, the microwave produces sparks and is failed."
2,Surprised and disappointed to find this too small for microwave popcorn.  The bag touches the sides and can’t rotate. Popcorn gets part burned and part unpopped. Found this out too late to return. 😕
3,power is not enough to properly pop a bag of popcorn
3,It doesn't have enough power. Everything takes longer. That is my fault for not reading the wattage. Otherwise it's great
