4,Looks good and works fine. Our only complaint is that it makes a buzzing sound from something loose inside and we need to press the top in order to make the buzzing stop. Not worth the hassle of figuring out where it’s coming from since it at least works
2,Takes a long time to heat food and the turntable is wobbly and falls off the center spoke. Must use two hands to open the door. Disappointed !!
2,size too big.  didn't use it
5,"Larger Microwave, a bit heavy but top quality.  If you want a microwave that is 2.2 sized, this is a good buy.  Everything is quality built.  It is slightly larger than we expected, but if you have the room on your counter, and want an oversized microwave, this is the one!"
3,strange configuration of menu and options. Works fine but the menu options are a pain.
2,"Not a bad microwave, but the keypad is total trash.  The plastic coating is already coming off in less than 6 months.  Wouldn't buy this product again."
4,"Product is nice, when you turn it on it makes a peculiar sound when in motion but It works fine. There's settings of choice, one button push starts a 30 second count but you can press another function to use for longer use. It always looks very clean inside, and new lol. Easy to wipe clean if needed. It's a pull handle. I put a thick spongy place mat to part front so it doesn't slide but it will on my counter if not. I unplug it after use because a Con-ed worker told me microwaves pull electricity even when not in use as long extension cords which I don't have. It's has weight but easy to move to wipe under counter, so far so good. Package well so dents just fine."
2,"The microwave does not get very hot, I have to heat things twice as long as my previous microwave. It also builds up lots of condensation inside, I have never seen that before. The air fryer feature takes twice as long to cook things too."
3,"This was, I thought, exactly what I needed.  I didn't even think to check the wattage.  I'm used to 1000 watts or more, what most homes have these days.  This one is not that.  Takes longer to cook anything, the door is really tight, you have to hold the unit to open the door.  The whole thing moves when you push the buttons.  I guess if this was your first microwave, it would be OK, but I'm used to a lot more for my money.  This will get us through until we can replace our built-in, but that's about it."
2,"I HAVE ORDERED B & D PRODUCTS FOR YEATS.  I HAVE TOOLS, KITCHEN EQUIP., ETC.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS MICRO-WAVE!  I REALIZE IT IS ONLY $100.00 BUT YOU WOULD AT LEAST EXPECT THE DOOR TO OPEN!THE BUTTON DOES NOT WORK AND YOU HAVE TO LIFT UP ON THE DOOR EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO PUT SOMETHING IN OR REMOVE SOMETHING!PRETTY BAD!"
2,"Purchased 2 months ago.  Within 2 weeks, a family member noticed she could hold the door handle a certain way, with the door closed, and it would TURN ON!  There was no time set on the timer, it just turned on with the right pressure.  Now, barely 2 months old, the light is not working properly.  It is about 30% normal brightness all of a sudden, but t flickers from 30% to about 10% and back and forth.  Bulb going out?  Electrical short??Oh yeah, and the plastic covering over the Start and Stop buttons is already wearing through.  I would not suggest this product at all!"
4,"Okay, this microwave is pretty awesome. (note: I have not bothered to look at the manual it comes with, perhaps answers to my problems are in there?)Two examples:1. I made oatmeal with two packets of oatmeal and cold milk. I selected the ""OATMEAL"" program, and it ""starts"". When it was done the oatmeal was perfectly done. Never had to say how much oatmeal.2. Four times, so far, I have used the ""REHEAT"" program. It too just starts, no asking about size/weight! Three times it worked perfectly; one time it seriously overcooked the food, barely edible that time. Only thing I can think of as the issue is that it was a very small portion of refrigerated vegetables (about 2 ounces).And I could list many more things I like about it, but just trust me, lol.Now some disappointing things about this microwave. I say disappointed because I can envision so many cheap and easy solutions that weren't done.1. For the programs I mentioned above, I have not figured out how to do them without my phone. Cheap and easy solution would be to change the awful keyboard and display to essentially a small tablet and run the nice phone app on it.2. There is no temperature probe. I can see, but haven't actually experienced yet, times when it would be needed (sensitive recipes, home science etc). My last microwave had a probe which I used to make perfect baked potatoes (210 degrees). That said, I've made 1 to 5 baked potatoes, and 1 to 3 sweet potatoes, and combinations using the ""POTATO"" program with perfect results every time. I guess this should be in pro list above, lol.3. Many (all?) of the programs start with an extensive period (1 minute?) of the microwave sniffing the food. My assumption is it's getting an extremely accurate measure of humidity and evaporation rate, but whatever, it seems to be a long time especially when it then decides to cook for 57 seconds, lol!Okay, that's enough. I love this microwave, still learning how it thinks."
4,It takes up more space than I thought it would. It really needs at least 1 foot breathing room all the way around it when using convection oven or in air fryer mode. It’s not really a air fryer as I know air fryer to be but cook’s good in air fryer mode. Microwave and convection oven works good.
3,Works great other than coming with the wrong size turntable assembly it was to latge.
5,"Its kinda small, but its okay. Makes doesn't make my counter look bulky."
1,"Warning before you order:My small city doesn't have the ubiquitous Amazon trucks scurrying about town; instead they use the USPS.  And the local post office refused to deliver this item.I have a steep driveway leading from my door down to the mailbox.  Typically, if a package is too large for the mailbox, the carrier will drive up to my door for delivery.  In this instance, someone decided the 37-pound box was too heavy to deliver.  I took three days of bureaucratic red tape on line to enable me to drive to the post office to retrieve the item.Usually, Amazon uses FedEX or UPS for oversized packages; why they didn't this time is a puzzle.As for the microwave itself, it should be fine - top-rated.  (But it is huge! Though not heavy!)"
2,The entire reason I ordered this microwave is to utilize feature Sound OFF. This feature does NOT work. I pressed the 8 key and it has zero response. I did this many times. I tried to reach out to company Comfee but there is no link to contact company. The ideal scenario is if Comfee replaces this microwave and then I will return the one that does not work.
1,"Extremely disappointed with the product. The build quality of Panasonic products is below average. This microwave broke down after 1 year and 1 month of purchase. Even though magnetron is covered for 5 years, Panasonic wanted me to ship this at my expense to the service center (nearest one is 162 miles away) which would cost more than the price of the microwave. I threw this out and purchased an LG microwave. The build quality of LG microwave is much better. There are two authorized LG service centers near my town. I had a smaller Sanyo microwave which became a little less efficient after 19 years of trouble free operation and I expected better performance from Panasonic.My parents purchased a Panasonic LED TV in 2015 and it broke down after 2 years. This also confirms my assessment of the overall sub par quality of Panasonic products."
3,It‘s a litter small，it doesn't affect the use
5,"Easy to use, great timing settings, pop corn etc"
5,Lite weight
2,Update: from may 2017!Was great while it lasted. It said goodbye today. 11-4-2020. You can take this review however you wish but a three-year lifecycle for 150 bucks does not seem very equitable on our part. Next we will try Toshiba
5,"Small footprint tucks neatly into the corner of our kitchen counter, and does a great job reheating soups or leftover plates. Although it's capable of more complex processes (like, multiple cooking stages, etc.), that's all we use it for."
5,"My GE microwave from 2005 finally crapped out. At first, I was unsure because I was looking for something with the exact same features. Found it with this one. Interior space cavity was large, but the outside was smaller than my old one. I love the one-button push for 1-6 minutes, and the 30 second add or 30 second start. and MOST IMPORTANTLY, I love how you can adjust the power level during cooking. The reviews said it could not be done, but this marked all the other boxes. and happy to say, it does. I can hit 1 minute start, and change the power level from 10 to 5, 30 seconds in, without interruption. my favorite feature!"
4,Not loud! Does the job. Not sure what the grill is for.
2,It works fine but it has a cheap display overlay which is peeling off. I called customer service and they couldn’t do anything. So I give it a 2 and will not buy this brand of microwave again.
5,very reasonable price ... just takes longer time to warm up food verses other ones ive had
5,I love this microwave. It’s exactly what what I needed for my kitchen. It’s small but works perfectly. I haven’t run into any issues yet. I trust Faberware.
4,"The only thing that I don’t like about this microwave is that it’s a little loud.  It might be better if it was. July in to a cabinet to help dampen the noise,  but on a countertop it’s a little louder than I had expected."
1,This Black & Decker microwave arrived in a box without any damage. Perplexed. In the past I’ve ordered items ‘lightly used’ or ‘slight damage’ ~ this is NOT acceptable Amazon.
3,"This microwave is ok. The chime on it works sometimes. When I set a timer, it doesn’t *chime* after the time is up, which is frustrating. The power isn’t very strong. I find I have to cook things much longer than I had to with my previous microwave.I would have returned this, but I didn’t have the box. I read reviews before I buy things and this had great reviews so I didn’t feel a need to keep the box. I should have! There are definitely better microwaves out there."
3,I have loved this microwave until now. This is the 1st baked potato I've tried to make in it and it caught on fire.Everything else has been perfect about it. It cooks great. But burns potatos better. I'm going to try and see if Farberware will help me out since Amazon is all robotic and unhelpful.I'm hoping this is just a bad microwave and that if I get a replacement it'll be a lot better with potatos.I'll update on what's up!
2,"The microwave oven works well enough, but................. the display is so dim that it is almost useless in normal kitchen light levels.  If I turn the kitchen lights off at night, I can than read the display, otherwise the display is too dim to read."
4,"Great microwave for the price! It did have a few dents in it so doesn't look as ""pretty"" but it works and that's what I needed was an affordable working microwave 😁"
5,Arrived on time. We use it all the time. It w as a great buy
3,I did not like the fact that it had no press to open part! But it’s cheap ! Works well!
2,Suddenly stopped working after 7 months.
1,"Ugh, I'm so aggravated. I bought this for my new home and barely used it. A week after using it, it started smoking from putting a Hot Pocket type frozen item in it. The item barely cooked -it was actually still cold - and yet the microwave was smoking. I guess the tiny bit of oil from this hot pocket or the MICROWAVE SAFE paper wrapping set it off, but that's it for me. I must return. I've had microwaves for years and they never smoke, even with paper plates in them. I don't feel safe having this in my home and as another commenter mentioned this is really hard to figure out how to work as well."
3,"low power; noisy, a basic microwave"
4,I bought this for my elderly mother and she really likes it. It's the perfect size for warming up coffee and leftovers.
1,"Hi,I received my microwave pretty quickly however, upon receiving it was damaged (See photos attached). unfortunately i was unable to return because at the time i was having family over and needed a microwave badly as my old one had ran its course. overall its ok. much smaller than my old one but it will do for now."
2,"Pros: It performs well, has many useful features, brightly lit inside and looks great.Cons: small interior making it difficult to fit dinner plate, plastic rotating support (under glass plate) often gets off track (design defect).Having to remove the glass plate and adjust the plastic piece after every use is annoying to me.  Hopefully you will have a better experience than me."
1,"I have bought this same model of microwave in the past and was very pleased. When the last one finally died I purchased this one on January 30th,It is May 4th and it is already dying. 3 months of use is ridiculous. I am extremely dissatisfied."
3,The microwave works well and works fairly well with echo dot.. but can not comprehend how a product designed to work with Alexa would not sync the clock with Alexa.. you have to manually enter the correct time.To me it is as stupid as Alexa entering your command cook time and power setting automatically but then require you to push the start button to start.If the time of day synced to WiFi or Alexa I’d rate this as a fantastic buy.. but can’t with this flaw.. very frustrating when power flickers or goes out to have to reset time.
1,"I had to replace my old microwave I had for 18 years. Got this one in July 2022 and now it's March 2023. It is having issues with keypad and a mind of it's own when room temperature is chilly for some reason. Besides keypad being too dark it doesn't always respond properly. Florida winters are warm and cold so heat not really used. Each time it gets too cool in the house the microwave just doesn't work. Today, trying to use it the turn table would not stop (microwave part was not on, only turn table for some reason) and buttons would not function. A couple hours later it started warming up (of course it does that here in Florida) and low and behold the stupid microwave started working again??? It has done this several times since the beginning of 2023. I know it sounds really strange and Toshiba wants a video which I can't send them. They won't help until that is done. So I guess I wait for the next episode for it to flare up again. I won't ever own another Toshiba product, ever! My previous microwave was inexpensive and lasted 18 YEARS!! People, things are just not made like they use to be, AT ALL!!"
1,"I’ve had this microwave for only 2 years and 2 months  . I had my previous one for almost 20 years. On this one  The light began flickering just a little while ago and has gotten worse . It’s goes completely out when I’m cooking and I can’t see the food . I called Toshiba and was told that I would have to get a technician to get it fixed because it was over the 1 year warranty. ??? That’s ridiculous. Why should I pay a technician to change a little bulb that should have lasted wayyy beyond this , meaning it was old and defective when I purchased. The repair will probably cost as much as the oven . I’m sorely disappointed and do not recommend that anyone purchase a microwave from this company"
5,Plenty of room.
2,THE BUZZER IS LOUD AND CONTINOUS. CANNOT BE STOPPED BY JUST SHUTTING DOOR ...NOISE GOES ON AND ON.CHILD LOCK BUZZER IS A PAIN!!! NOT NEEDED.  NEVER HAD ONE ON ANY OTHER MICROWAVE.A BAD IDEA!!!! beep  beep  beep  beep  etc!!!!
3,Every time you open the door it hisses like it’s got an air leak and it takes about double the time to heat food than my old microwave. But popcorn cooks as normal? We didn’t return it because of covid it’s such a hassle to take anything back. But I wouldn’t buy this again. Hopefully it’ll hold up a year at least
1,"Bought in June, dead in October.  It doesn't heat my food anymore.  It'll be a great source of a big magnet once I take it apart though.  I know, I could've bought a magnet for a few bucks but heck, this keeps the economy moving, alas in China for the most part.  This microwave was used sparingly, very sparingly indeed since I'm the only one using it and then for just a few minutes a week.  I'm not telling you to not buy it.  The next one up could be another piece of deflating rubbish as this one.  Virginia, we're not in the fifties any more.  It's all about keeping the waste economy moving.  Garbage in garbage out."
3,It doesn’t link to my alexa
4,Love everything about it but it’s too small for my kitchen but gone to keep it
4,"My only complaint about this microwave is that the latch is in a rather awkward location (bottom right corner) and the latch is rather ""stiff""....rather difficult to push and makes a lot of noise.  Other than that minor complaint, I am very pleased with this product.  It is just what I needed."
4,"Delivered quickly, easy to set up and use."
5,I was disappointed that the instructions did not come with the microwave.  I had to go online at the library to learn how to run it.  Couldn't print it for reference at home. Also some air fryer recipes would have been helpful.
2,"So I bought this microwave because I have a very small space to put it.  In that respect it's great.  But that's all.  The glass inside tray and round roller underneath constantly lose their position and when you use the microwave the turning motion is willy nilly.  Loud and off course.  Also, I had to call to set clock as manual is not correct as the product specialist admitted to me..."
3,This is 19 inch and my regular kitchen microwave is 22 inch. But this has features like a baby microwave. I put it in our garage to use when kids go in there. I couldn't replace it with mine. Just didn't measure up but again it is a small microwave and for an apt I guess it's great. I don't like the door how there is no button to open it just pull on the door. Seems like that will be the first to break. Should have returned it
4,The oven works as expected but I do not like the key pad. Other than that I am more than satisfied with the product.
5,Excellent very happy with it
1,"Purchased June 14, stopped working August 27. Total rip off. From now on, it's ""MADE IN THE USA!"""
4,I have only been using for 2 days; so far working good. I mainly use for reheating food. Also nice and compact and good looking (black stainless).
4,"I had a GoldStar 1150W microwave for over 25 years.  I paid under a $100 for it new.  All models in that power range today are 4 or 5 times that in price. Thus, I went with this model and though it does what I need it to do, it just doesn't do it as fast or as well.  The control panel is also lacking from the old model."
2,"bought one in 2018 -and another 2022. both just quit. The newest one quit today, buttons not working but will run when door closed but not heat. The first one quit 2021 and just didnt heat.  will buy another brand this time"
3,works fine but is pretty small actually. i can barely fit a large plate in the microwave
4,Good little microwave for the price. Not very high powered though. You end up having to add about a minute to most cook times.
5,"Very easy just plug and go microwave.Perfect for small spaces, light and compact but fits large size plate.Spins and works great. Lots of programmable options!Really like it! Great brand! Looking forward to purchasing more of this brands items in the future!"
5,"I wanted a small microwave and this fit the bill. I had another I got at Costco different brand but it looks exactly the same.what I didn’t like about that one was that the inside started peeling off after a year or so, so I’ll see if this one does it too. I don’t like the controls tho, they are very hard to read, almost a dark gray on black, not sure why they would chose that color combo, it’s really bad. Works great."
1,"Ìt does the job, but the number panel is rubbing off after only a few days just from gentle touch. This is poorly made by Toshiba or refurbished. Either way I'm very disappointed Toshiba"
3,"The microwave arrived today on time. However, all four legs are loose and wobbly. It does not sit level on the countertop because one leg is a little shorter than the others. I contacted Amazon and was asked if I had contacted the manufacturer. Therefore, I reached out via email and have not heard from them yet. I do not wish to return the microwave. If possible, I just want to know if the legs can be replaced. Waiting to hear from someone. I'm hoping to resolve this without the trouble of having to return the microwave. Once my problem with the legs has been resolved, I will change my rating and give an update on it."
2,wouldn't buy this again.  Way to small and very under powered.  Things take twice as long to cook.  I like GE products but this isn't good.
5,This thing is awesome. Fits a standard size plate and to have it a smart microwave connected to Alexa is awesome.
3,Doesn’t heat as expected. Have to add time .
5,Modern black and stainless steel exterior.Loaded with useful settings and options.Just the right size for our small apartment without taking up too much counter space.
5,"I needed a replacement microwave and convection oven both at the same time and came across this while searching online. It does the job of both plus it is an air fryer beside all in one unit. Perfect one unit to replace two!It cooks faster than my old microwave, I use the air fryer almost everyday. Its quiet. The convection oven does not get hot on the outside. It wipes down nicely.My only con is the settings are difficult to see during daytime yet fine at night and I haven't figured out how to set the microwave for seconds vs full minutes so I use my Alexa to time anything which needs a minute and 30 seconds to cook. There maybe a way to do it but I haven't reviewed the manual that far to find out.Well I hope this last a long time. I highly recommend this unit..P.S. Did I mention it has a broiler feature also. Love everything about this GE."
4,"So far, so good. The last microwave I purchased on Amazon broke within 2 months. Its only been 1 month so far with this new one, but i like it. Not a high-powered machine, so it takes a little longer to cook things, i'd say 25% longer on average. So something that takes a minute, will take 75-90 seconds instead. Or a potato that takes 6 minutes (3 per side) will take closer to 8 minutes."
4,"The microwave itself works well, but there's a super loud fan that sounds like a jet engine that runs when being used. The beeper that indicates when it's done beeps five times and continues to beep even after the door is opened."
1,I don't like it because it doesn't heat properly it either under heat or over heat
5,"A good sized microwave and works great. It fits my microwave stand well and is easy to use. It is easy to open with the pull handle, easy to clean, it cooks/heats up my food timely and effectively to my satisfaction! It matches my other stainless steel items and is a good value for the price and reasons stated."
4,it is a fine microwave for light use.
1,"This microwave was missing the inside piece of plexiglass on the door.  With the plexiglass missing, all you had was a screen on the inside.  When you heated something up, the door would become steamed up on the inside and could not be wiped off.  The door became disgustingly dirty quickly.  When I called to return it, I was told I could take it to an appliance repair shop and they could probably fix it.  I told them I wanted to return it so they finally agreed.  Now I find that they only refunded me for $120 for this piece of junk.  I returned it in the same condition I received it.  I had it for  about 6 weeks before I figured out what the problem was.  Also, the Powerlevel function did not work.  THIS IS JUNK and the company selling it sucks!"
4,I haven’t had the unit very long but I had limited counter space of 17” wide so the microwave fit my main objective. It also looks nice and matches other stainless steel appliances. So far it’s working well for me.
1,"Did not work out of the box. Lights were on, timer , turntable, clock, etc. but did not heat food."
3,"Did I mention this microwave is loud?*There's no quiet mode so you're stuck with incessant beeping. And it does NOT stop when you open it or hit the button.*The light is useless. You cannot see inside while it's on.*After 2 yrs with this machine,  the plate has cracked and it rotates continuously even after you open the door. (I don't think that's supposed to happen.)*The coating inside has started to wear off in a few spots which is odd because I only use mild dish washing liquid to clean it. One time I did the ol' vinegar trick and it left permanent water spots in the coating. ***DO NOT STEAM VINEGAR IN THIS MICROWAVE****No matter what you do,  there is no quiet way to close the door. It sounds like you're angry slamming the microwave every single time.Otherwise,  it is pretty. I have the white/stainless steel version. It is THE nicest looking microwave on the market. I use defrost constantly and it works well. I don't use the other buttons really so I cannot comment on how useful is the pizza button. It microwaves just fine.I'd give this a higher rating if it wasn't so loud, the coating stayed on,  and the plate would stop rotating after I opened the door. Also, I didn't think I was supposed to buy a new one every 2 yrs😑So sad... it's so pretty"
4,Great. Works well
4,"Bought amazing high end top selling PANASONIC Microwave on sale with knob & digital screen. Promises it can handle & do any/everything.Was best microwave ever until 9 months past, and it just stopped working altogether.Needed new microwave ASAP and as large and powerful as I could afford.This was a top seller with good reviews.It is a working large powerful microwavePROS: REALLY FOR ME IS THE HANDLE TO OPEN. NO BIG BUTTON TO OPEN MICROWAVE DOORCONS:1. THE FLAT TOUCH NO ACTUAL BUTTONS.  THE ""START"" STARTED TO SHOW WEAR LESS THAN A WEEK OF USE.2. TOOK THE MOST BASIC LONG STANDING ENTRY OF TIME BY KEYPAD NUMBER TO ENTER HOW LONG TO RUN MICROWAVE.....Then... Messed up the simple no frills way everybody knows how a cheap number pad entry works.It is missing ONE CRUCIAL ""BUTTON"" ON FLAT PANEL TOUCH ENTRY.TO ENTER TIME FOR COOKING YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE ""CLOCK BUTTON >>>  TWICE  <<<  BEFORE YOU CAN ENTER TIME WITH KEYPAD.WHY? EVERY TIME, IF YOU PRESS ONLY ONCE YOU ARE IN SETTING TIME IN CLOCK (Which I usually do once during the ownership of any microwave (save for very rare power line breaks)3. I have it to the side, where there happens to have poorer lighting. I keep a small flashlight there if it is too dark to see.... For example if I do a rare lowering of power for a specific food.I'M ADMITTEDLY JADED ABOUT BUYING MICROWAVE OVENS.IT WORKS FINE TO DATE. If it last a few or more years, I paid kinda a lot for a really basic no frills microwave oven with flat panel buttons already showing wear.I really need it to work for a reasonably long timeHere's to hoping"
2,"UPDATE: 2/6/2022 Downgraded rating because the WIfi just stopped working altogether and even though there were many attempts to power off and on and reset, the Wifi is non-existent. Still heats pretty good.This microwave was purchased as my previous Panasonic microwave was interfering with my Wifi. The instructions for setup was so easy. It connected easily to my Alexa and has stayed connected with no issues. I simply tell Alexa the tine I want it to cook and the microwave starts right up. I can even tell Alexa to start the microwave at any future time. Connected directly through my Wifi,  the microwave keeps accurate time in the display. Be sure to peel off the clear plastic on the keypad. This microwave cooks great and is accurate. Defrosting is perfect as well. I am very pleased."
3,"This microwave oven was bought on sale, but after using it for several times, I found it was not as good as the old one. Normally, the food taken out of the refrigerator has reached room temperature for 30 seconds, but this microwave oven takes one minute, which is not recommended"
4,"5.20.22~ Almost didn't get this bc just got Air Bake Toaster Oven.The toaster is Amazing but my old microwave was on borrowed time.The best part about playing with 'GE' over the last month is the Carousel.Every item, of every cook method, can go on the glass microwave carousel.Convection cooking, Carousel. Air Bake, Carousel. Before I say ""Carousel"" again~Let me share Why it's Amazing. Makes Foolproof, Evenly Baked Food, in Less Time.On to Details but First Tip~ *Keep the Directions.Cheat Sheet is Must Have but you can snap a pic to have quick access.*Convection Oven~ Focaccia BreadYou can Regular Bake in this but Convection Saves you Money .No Preheat & Every Recipe reduces heat by 25 Degrees And 10 minutes.Got this tip from 'King Arthur' while using their flour for bread & it worked.Only downside with 'Convection' is, still no clue how to set timer.Used egg timer but can also use phone alarm or lmk if you figure it out.**Air Bake~ Frozen Hash BrownsPush Air Bake button twice to get Preset options.Did A1 (Fries) 1st Try. Cooked from Thaw but Not Crispy after 15 minutes.Then did A5 (Fish Sticks). Better but a few min on 'Broil' is Best to Crisp.Have not mastered from Frozen to Crisp 'Air Bake'.However with the Carousel (had to say it), cooking time cut dramatically.So 9 min on A1 cooked my Hash Browns Golden & 3 min Broil got Crisp.My Toaster Oven 'Air Bake' is Crispy Quicker & it's Hamilton Beach so not fancy.***Broil~ Will Crisp any thing, Quickly, and also works on Carousel.What's best about this feature is the 'Flip Alert'.Whatever your set time, even 90 seconds, beeps halfway for flip.Keeps moving so you can pass on flip. alert stops after a few beeps.Every other feature is pretty self-explanatory so on to ~****Microwave ( and my reason for 4 stars besides Air Bake learning curve)*You can't just push a number for seconds.1-6 are 'Express Cook' and Express Only unless you press 'Cook Time' 1st.Ok, that I get but why will 7-9 not work for seconds solo?*This is a Multi-Task oven. User Must remember Not to Use Metal on Micro Mode.Which could be confusing for newly solo people bc it comes with metal pans.If you're looking at this as Dorm Room gift, maybe toaster oven a better call.*Heating Element is SpectacularSomehow heats food in bowl without scorching fingers touching the bowl.Bowls will get hot but 2 min on my old micro would need pot holder. This doesn't.Plus, you get bubbly edges on gravy/cream based dishes.*****Cosmetic Details~*Black & Silver. Shows every smudge, swipe & fingerprint.Even on the relatively clear coated door.My last one was White & for 200 bucks, I know there are resistant materials.**The Beep~It's loud but not mind numbingly so.Its saving grace is that it's not high pitched.More Electric Toothbrush tone than Smoke Detector throw-against-a-wall EekThere you are. My probably way too long & hopefully helpful experience.For my use & responsibility level feel like it's worth the 200 bucks,Just for the (say it with me), Carousel, and The Convection.If I could find a similar one with One Press Second buttons, would choose that.The reason? Warming cat food in the morning.Before coffee, I need to press as few buttons as possible before being tripped by cat.The Win is it's nice to have another gadget that,doesn't require emptying bakeware from my oven but,can use the bakeware stored in my oven, even silicone sheets."
3,Everything is good until the turntable stops working after 3 years.  Any suggestion how to fix it?
2,"I am sorry I bought this microwave!  I bought it in August.  In the past couple of weeks I have notice the plastic film over the control panel is disintegrating over the 'start' and 'stop' buttons.  Also, it is very slow in doing TV dinners. Takes much longer than my previous microwave.  Just not happy with it at all, and I do wish I had bought a better quality one."
4,"It's a little smaller than we thought it would be.  The controls are not too complicated, the instructions are adequate, and it works just fine.  Not a lot of power (800 w) so pay attention to instructions on prepared foods - you will need to add a little more time since everything I've seen assumes 1000w.A nice little machine that do far does everything we need it to do."
5,Works great. Just a basic microwave without the bells and whistles. Has a timer and some preset buttons.
1,"This is probably the 5th or 6th microwave I've owned both in countertop and over the range models. It is also the noisiest - and I had one of the first microwaves produced. Unless you have a photographic memory, you'll have to refer to the manual for defrosting or melting butter/chocolate, though after you dig the manual out and program the machine, the butter does melt nicely. There are directions for softening/separating bacon slices, but not for cooking them. I end up cooking bacon 1 minute at a time to avoid burning. Instead of having a number pad to set the power, you have to push the power level button. For the Keep Warm setting, that involves pushing the button 11 times! Using the Sensor Cook Function to cook fish fillets, press 11 times. To add time, press Timer(More) and it adds 20% more time, get out your calculator to figure out what that would be. The Quick 30 pad requires that you also hit the Start pad. Why? There are no shortcuts to 1 minute heating, 2, etc. (hit 1, hit 0, hit 0, hit start). I bought this oven because it had all the features I wanted. It never occurred to me that what could be such a simple process has been made so unnecessarily complex. Why require 3 movements when 1 will suffice?  I do not recommend this oven."
1,After a while started to do a scary zapping noise/flashing thing inside occasionally. Now when I closed the door before programming it- it's started to hum like it's running (but with the light off and turn table not rotating) and seemed to be heating up the food more. Also abnormally hot on top- maybe because it was running on its own part of the day.
4,"This thing is a bit larger than what I'd anticipated ... and the kooky settings took some getting used to ... but overall, we like it! (If you're used to a larger or standard-size microwave, make sure you use dishes small enough to revolve on the smaller turntable.)"
3,The top part of the chrome on the handle was loose when the product arrived. Other than that the microwave works great. No other issues till now. Hopefully will stay that way
5,It takes up little room on the counter and it just works.
4,Good stuff
2,"Microwaves need to distribute power over space and time.This microwave takes the cheap approach for both: The reflector is static and the magnetron runs at full bore for seconds at a time.The fallout is that you can get a lower power microwave than this one for cheaper and get a better experience to boot, if you know what you're looking for."
5,Now I do love this microwave. I purchased this after my last one went out on me after less than a year of use. I do love it although I haven’t figured out how to add my wifi and use Alexa. Now it’s also good to note that I also haven’t read the manual so there’s that…..nonetheless I like this microwave
5,"I truly love this microwave/air fryer/convection oven. Roomy. I also really like that when the bell dings, it stops as soon as you open the door, instead of six dings! Also gives about 10 seconds before it starts to ding at the end of cook time.  Don't know about anyone else, but that bell has always been irritating to me."
3,Love the size but the clear plate inside that rotates keeps coming off bracket. You have to keep putting it back on
1,This product started smoking toxic fumes after the third time I used it. It made me feel sick for a couple days. Never buy this crap again. Is the worst product to ever ever had in my life? Would not recommend to my enemy. Do yourself a favor and don't buy any more Chinese crap
4,"My previous little microwave was a feather compared to this beast. You might want help nearby if you have to wedge it into a small space above a refrigerator (like I did). Be very careful taking off all the plastic and tape, even though you probably won't. Unless you're veerrrry thorough, it will stink like a burning Kardashian the first few times.But the air fryer fries air. The broiler broils just fine. Microwave waves micros. Seems worth the money.THE BUTTONS DO NOT LIGHT UP! That's the only warning I have. Gotta have a light nearby."
5,A ok
1,"Has no power. It takes twice as long to heat food as it should. If a product says 2 minutes on high this piece will require 4 minutes. Thought it was a good deal but I should have known, you get what you pay for..."
5,Works fantastic
1,Broke only after 2 months of use bad connection wonder if it was the way it was shipped
4,"I think microwaves should be required by law to have a mute feature to silence the beeps. I returned another 700w microwave I bought locally because it didn't have this feature, and a couple other dislikes. The primary reason I bought this microwave was because of the mute feature! I love its non-beeping!I'm not sure its heating as well as it should because the other 700w microwave I took back to the store that this one replaced, seemed to heat a cup of coffee much hotter at 30 or 60 seconds. I wont return this to really know if another one would work better because the white version of this microwave is no longer available...I had to buy a used one just to get this one. That could be why someone else returned it. It works well enough for me and I use it mostly to reheat a cup of coffee in my office.I like the white color. Black is cool, but the white allows my eyes to read the words on the controls much easier.Also, the left handed operation handle (handle on right of door with hand hold recess on its left) is perfect for me. I'm almost always reheating a cup of coffee and I'm right handed. I dont have to switch hands or set my cup down to open the door on this microwave like I do on some others (and the one I returned that this one replaced). Coffee in right hand, left hand opens the door with only one hand...perfect for me!Only 4 stars because I think its not heating as hot as it should and there are no replacements to be had for me to return to try another one, AND I dont know how any of the other functions work, how evenly it heats foods or how long this will last at this point, but the muting of the beeps is paramount! The microwave I returned had 5 obnoxious beeps at the end of a cycle! Love the silence of the beeps!"
5,I’m happy with this purchase. Works great. Plenty big. Nice looking.
4,"I bought this a couple of months ago as a replacement for my old microwave that served me for 17 plus years.  The interior is smaller than I expected but it is big enough.  I am still learning the controls, but that's me, not the microwave.  Overall I am very pleased."
4,"Works well, but is smaller then I thought it would be."
2,Great microwave lousy oven/air fryer. Heats up kitchen more than regular oven impossible to regulate temp and time when using any other function  besides microwave. Do not recommend.
5,"This microwave works great for us, which is mostly cooking veggies and reheating coffee. I really like the  ""pizza"" button. It heats leftover pizza through without it getting tough or gummy."
5,Good
5,"I needed a replacement for my previous model which stopped working. My objective in microwave selection has to do with size and countertop space mainly. I don't want anything too large or oversized.These smaller units are not as fast or efficient as larger microwaves, but I seldom just stand and wait at a microwave anyway. I just put the item I want to heat in, set the time, walk away, and then eventually return later.This unit isn't nothing fancy, but it works and gets the job done, all while not being a space hog. I suppose when shopping for an appliance, you need to consider what you prioritize for your purchase. Different people will have different needs. This meets mine."
4,Great value
5,This is a great microwave and the price is nice.
1,"Bought it in 2018, it stopped working completely in 2022.  I might gave expected that from a $40 microwave but not a $150 one.  It was rarely used and still looks great but the Magnetron threw a fault code and Panasonic wants to charge $10 just to talk to them about it.GE here I come!"
3,Hard to read the keys with out a light on in the room other than that I like it ok .
5,"When my previous small microwave oven died after 10+ years of service, I decided to go with this Toshiba.  Have had it now for 5 months and it has worked fine from Day 1 for my basic needs with a few added benefits that my old one didn't have.  Zero issues!"
5,I use it for re-heating
3,"It would be nice if I didn’t spend 45 minutes getting the tape residue off of it. In the process, I scratched it so that’s nice.. but it’s a nice microwave. Looks nice and is big."
3,"Didn't outperform my 12 year old Microwave-Convection from Kenmore (Elite).  Kind of ironic but my older unit was better in most ways (except it has no air fryer function which didn't work well anyway).1. My old unit had a knob which when rotated increased or decreased time, temp, selection options, etc.  Pressing it selected choices made.  Handy and quickly.2.  Old unit had a handle for opening, as opposed  to push-button which was difficult to use.  This surprised me but I really preferred the handle for opening.3.  Old unit had fewer controls but verbal option on the display that could be selected via handy knob.  For example, to select the defrost, you selected the type of item you were defrosting (e.g., meat, fish, etc.), and how much it weighed and pressed the knob.  It did all the calculations!4.  Old units display  was much easier to read-- with the new unit I need my glasses and flash light.How many ways can I say that the older unit was beautifully designed and the new unit was not (you actually needed to download the user manual to have the numeric codes to cook many things!).Unfortunately, the old unit is no longer made so I replaced one part (the tray ring) and we'll see how many more years I get out of it.  It will be a sad day when I must throw it out."
1,"Dead out of the box.  What a hassle.  I'd say buying a big appliance over the internet is questionable; what a pain to return.  Who knows if it's lousy Toshiba QC or it got tossed around too much in shipping.  Bottom line is, I'm not waiting for them to send me another one; I just picked one up at Best Buy.  Nice idea to have it delivered to my doorstep, but only if it works.Addendum:I should probably add, I called Toshiba before declaring it dead, just in case I was missing something obvious like a power switch.  The customer service rep I spoke to was having a hard time focusing, and seemed a bit out to lunch.  I said I wasn't going to reorder a replacement through amazon, since this was a hassle, and we really wanted a microwave yesterday; he gave me a hard time about that too.  Not really impressive."
5,"I've been really happy with this purchase!We removed the over-range microwave/hood to open up the space. I was a little hesitant because we use the microwave daily to warm up milk or leftovers, melt butter, defrost, etc. But it's never anything LARGE and we don't otherwise cook with it.So I decided to try this little micro in our pantry and it's worked out perfectly.Some of the reviews offered poor ratings, especially for cook time. So I anticipated taking a little longer to heat things up, and it's true. It's obviously going to be a little less powerful than a full-size oven. So instead of taking 1:30 to heat up my milk for a latte, it takes more like 2 minutes. Or a bowl of stir-fry might have taken 2 minutes before and now requires 3. But I'm fine with that. I'm much happier having me kitchen space more open, with this little gem hidden in the pantry.Features I like: the door-pull is easy to use and preferred over a ""push-button"" open;  I can turn off the beep; it runs quietly, and the buttons for popcorn, defrost, etc. are easy to use and accurate."
5,I was grateful for the next day delivery.  My microwave died on the same day the new one arrived!!  Wonderful timing.  THANK YOU!!!
4,Kind of small but works well for a small office . Not best for in home use. College dorm or small apartment use is good.
4,"Please note that this microwave is really large!  Big!  Immense!  It will fill up an ordinary kitchen counter.  It is also very high wattage and cooks things fast, very fast.The microwave is nicely made and seems to be good quality; I particularly like that it is not noisy.  As with most microwaves, there are a bewildering variety of options and auto-sensors and hard-to-remember button sequences.  But for just regular use, heating something, or cooking a frozen dinner, etc., it works very well."
3,"We ordered this to use while we were redoing our kitchen. It seemed to have everything and we really wanted to try air frying.The good:It works fine, all the functions are functional.The badYou can't just start convection set a time to cook and come back when it finishes, you have to turn it back on with a timer once the oven reaches temp.Can't turn off the turntable.The Manual does not mention the air fry function. (Air fry does work, but I had to get info from youtube.The manual is weak, compounded by strange procedures. There is a section on the turntable reset function. It is hard for me to imagine a circumstance in which that would be important.I accept that the strange procedures may be my flawed paradigm. I am very unimpressed at the thought that went into the procedures to make this work.But it works."
3,I have had this a little while and it works but sometimes it decides not to heat.  The tray does not go around smoothly and makes a lot of noise.  I wont buy again.
5,I bought this because my new home had a defective drawer microwave and had to be replaced.I love this one so much I am keeping it even though my drawer one is now fixed.  Interesting I find I am using both at the same time............I have a gray and white kitchen so this one looks nice on my counter as well.
2,This microwave was delivered with a six inch unremoveable mark down the front.  It can't be removed.
5,"This, along with all other Toshiba items, is a nice product. The only issue I had is that Toshiba does not offer those much needed extended service plans, which was why I had no choice but to return the unit back to Amazon for a full refund. It was also unfortunate that it was not even available through Asurion or Amazon themselves. As we all know all too well about the 1 year manufacturer's warranty curse, and I had experienced it first hand several times, products tend to go bad just days after the original 1 year manufacturer's warranty expires, leaving us to hold the bag when it comes to having to pay out of pocket for very expensive repairs, which is why I cannot emphasize enough the need for extended service plans for ALL products from ALL business and company names. So please, Toshiba, kindly please, finally make it available as soon as you can. Thank you much."
4,"I like the sleek look but I’ve only had this for a few days. I did notice that’s it’s loud tho and the panel does not light up , so it’s hard to see"
5,Going on 18 months used daily.
2,Love how compact this microwave is but it didn’t last long and smoked several times.  Seems like a fire hazard.  Don’t recommend buying this.
4,But the board doesn’t light up to see the numbersThat the control board doesn’t light up.
1,"Trying to use the keypad is like staring into a black abyss.  I thought it might be the protective sticker that was causing it to not resemble the photo on Amazon, but no.  Just as dark without it.  I thought I'd include a picture so you can see I'm not kidding.  Maybe it looks great under studio lighting, or in daylight, but it fails miserably under my kitchen light where all previous microwaves excelled.I owned the previous model of this microwave and thought I'd ""upgrade"" to this since it's supposed to have an ""easy clean"" interior.  Turns out, the interior is identical-looking to my previous model, which has begun to rust out after approx. 3 years of use.  That's right, it's rusting at all the seams, and even the middle of the top panel.  A big chunk of paint even came off from the area just below the front lip.  Too much steam I guess.  Oh, and the LED light that lights up the inside went out on the previous model after a couple of years, which I didn't mind because it was a sick bluish color.  Anyway, all that said, I should have gotten the previous model again since they are both for sale, and the previous model is about $10 cheaper. Lesson learned.  It's too late for me, but maybe not for you.Oh, I've ""fixed"" the blacked-out number issue by marking the most commonly used buttons with white electrical tape so that I can find them and not accidently cook my food longer (or shorter) than necessary.I know that defeats the purpose of the blacked-out look, and it looks awful, but it's better than being non-functional.  Oh well. It's not forever. This thing will probably rust out in a few years anyway.On the plus side, I do like the feature of turning off the sound, but not enough to give it a star."
2,"Very disappointed in this unit. We purchased it for a new home in May 2019. With only very normal usage by two older adults, we didn't even get two years use before it started shutting off after a few minutes.We never even learned to use the convection feature, which in my opinion, is very badly implemented.We are on limited income, and with repair costs such as they are right now, just having it looked at would cost half of a new unit.These failings mean we likely stay away from the Toshiba line in the future. I need more dependability over time.I have never failed to get 6 to 10 years use out of a full sized microwave.I would suggest you take a pass on this unit."
4,The overall performance is excellent. Custom timers and defrost appear to be fairly accurate. My biggest complaint is the lack of a lighted display panel at night. I have included pictures however the reflective surface made it hard to capture a good image. Probably similar issue at night with the non-lighted display.
1,Never got a chance to use it couldn't get keypad to work. Only one number works the number 1..
2,"Unit lasted just three years.  No wonder the warranty is only one year.  Not worth the money, suggest anyone getting this, return it or regift it to some third world place."
3,"Microwave is a good size. It was a decent price during Amazon Day, however it is not the best microwave. It makes loud grinding noises as mentioned by others. I just received mine in 07/23. It's almost like the motor needs some type of lubricant. Fortunately I am not planning to use it very often."
3,"It seems to be a Good little combo oven.There's only (2) things that are problematic for me:#1. Clock doesn't stay on. I'm sure this isn't a big issue for most people, but for me it is. I use it as the main house clock.#2. This is the biggie for me! You can only air fry by using the pre-sets. H1-H9 which ""All"" air fry at 425°F. You ""Can Not"" set the amount of time nor the degrees at which you wish to air fry at!The microwave part and the convection part work fine and are easily set to your preference.It's quiet, easily installed and looks great in the kitchen."
4,Blessings in Holy SHABD. Holy Sound current....so that product is adequate...namaste...
5,I love it! It’s much quieter than my last.
5,Arrived ahead of schedule and undamaged. Works great.
1,"It was fine, until it wasn't. After only two years it stopped working, giving an error message that likely means the unit us fried. I researched a lot before buying this microwave and it let me down."
1,"Dislike, it's very small compared too the photo doesn't warm like it's supposed too, have too warm over and over just too get results"
4,"when I first got this microwave I used it for the first time, it had a loud hum to it, yes, louder that the normal noise hum, BAM!!!! , This thing not only tripped my GFCI , but it actually blew out my breaker in my breaker box, yes blew out the breaker had to get a new one and have it replaced. Dumpster bound"
2,My only issue is it has a very low power level which it probably states I just didn’t pay attention lol so it takes awhile to heat things up in comparison to my last one !
3,"My 3 star review is really about personal preference.  The oven works okay but I'm used to more convenience. Our previous microwave oven that broke down after 17 years had several one touch settings starting with 30 seconds; One minute, two minutes, on up to 5 minutes were all 1 touch settings.  This oven has no one touch settings, including popcorn.  Even ""quick 30 seconds"" requires hitting that setting PLUS ""Start.""  I'm not really as lazy as it may seem.  My vision is failing, and it was so easy to see the one-touch settings on my previous oven.  The Start button on this oven isn't where I expect it to be, so I have to think about it.  I use a microwave mainly for quick conveniences, I don't really get excited about all the sensors. It is terrible for popcorn, unlike our previous microwave.  You have to scroll through the options for how many ounces your pouch is, and if you can find that info on your popcorn pouch, none of the options on the oven are likely to match it.  I have not yet been able to get the add time or subtract time option to work on any setting.  I hate learning curves.  Maybe I'm just too old for the new-fangled ideas. this! It is not intuitive, and for a microwave, this should not be the case.  HOWEVER, it is fantastic at defrosting and also at softening butter, if you don't mind pushing a lot of buttons to get the settings just right."
5,"So far has worked as expected. With several colleagues using this microwave, we've had no issues."
1,Came damaged
1,This microwave wasn't what I was expecting to be sturdy on the surface I have to put something under it to make it stay still
4,"I've had this microwave for a few months & it seems to be quite good at cooking.  It's 100 watts more powerful (900 watts v. 800 watts) than most microwaves this size, so it does cook quicker.  I replaced this with an older, more expensive Panasonic model which was quieter.  The noise level is not disturbing though.  A good feature is that you can shut off the beeping noise (like when its done cooking or pressing buttons).  This is helpful when someone is sleeping or on the phone close by & you have to cook something.  The presets for cooking popcorn, potatoes & heating water work well.  I find the unit easy to clean.  When heating something that gives off significant moisture the glass fogs up quite a bit.  It takes a while to defog.  I leave the door open which helps quicken the process.  Overall, a great value for the money."
4,It’s a really nice microwave but the glass tray doesn’t turn. Isn’t it suppose to turn when your heating something up? What should I do?
5,Size
4,It's a nice color and works great. I use it often. I just wish I would have gotten on little larger.
2,This takes way too long to reheat things - and if it's frozen... just forget it. Have invested in a much larger and more powerful unit. This one is not for me.
4,Wish i could leave a better review.. But fired it up and it started sparking like crazy. Took a closer look and the wave guard is litteraly torn in half... so. I'm sure this microwave works great. Looks great. But... now I gotta buy a new wave guard. Before it burns my house down
3,"No fault of the product, but was weaker and took longer than what I have used before, but I was going for cheap and it was.  Works fine, I just have to cook things longer.  Guess I'm impatient."
1,"New microwaves are supposed to last 7 years. This brand did NOT last long: The bottom is delaminated,(The coating cracked from the bottom so the microwave is not usable). It is really small inside it. A normal dinner plate is a close fit. The plate that turns the food slips off often. The microwave gets hot on top of the right side even when it is not running. Hard to clean once food gets in the cracks at the back on the bottom. Even though I tried to get that area with a soft-bristled brush after using normal methods, It is still stained in the crack and looks dirty inside when it is just cleaned. Wish a warranty was offered for this POS. I would have sent it back if knew the low quality."
5,I love it... And size is good
1,I just received this product the Panasonic Microwave Oven NN-SN686S. As soon as I tried to open the door it would not spring open. I thought I had to plug it in to get power so I did. I would close the door which was fine it had that click sound and I would not be able to force open it. Then I pressed the push open button. The door would stay closed however the interior would light up and I can pull the door open. I would then watch some reviews of this microwave and sure enough the door was supposed to release the door in a way that it would spring open. QA was terrible they need to check this simple issue before sending it out.
1,When we put it together and started using it everything was great. But often the wheel spinner will spin and force the plate off the tracks while it's running. This in the long run will burn out the motor for turning it. The wheel spinner for under the dish just seems too small and I thought that was odd. If I could get the correct parts for this then I would change the review because it's really a great microwave.
2,"First one I ordered wobbled really bad, tried to put a wedge under it helped some, but the door didn't fully shut so the steam (smoke) would pour out the door when using the microwave function.  Contacted support they said steam should not be escaping from the door and they issued a replacement.  Got the replacement today, it has a big dent in the corner so the back is separated from the side and it wobbles as well, not as much as the first one did.  Haven't even tried to use it, just boxing it back up.  Amazon is great for returning it.  Not sure if I want to try a third or not."
1,I was very disappointed and worried for my safety having this product in my home. It started smoking inside every time I use it.. I cannot return it and would not recommend you purchase it !!
3,"It was nice while it lasted, 3 1/2 years, which I guess is good these days. But today it died, dramatically. There was a bang and then flames they didn’t last, but the inside of the microwave is a mess. And now I need to find a new one."
4,"I bought this to replace an old GE convection microwave.  The first one came so damaged it was unusable.  The second one didn't work right, so that got returned too.The convection stops and starts a lot, even the fan, but apparently that is normal?  It seems to bake in the allotted time.I love the size of the inside for my baking.The only thing I don't really like is the stainless on the outside.  It's hard to keep looking clean."
4,"We replaced a 700 wt Microwave. This one is even smaller, so some of our microwave dishes had to be scrapped. The ""Bump"" on the interior really obstructs our prior popcorn popper from turning and if it ""overflows"", it cease to turn. Because we are limited in space, it will have to do.  Pretty discouraging as the  interior is black the ""bump' we were trying to avoid wasn't obvious in the picture."
1,"It worked well for 7 months and now no power. Call Panasonic and can't get past automated service and they send me to a page on support that has no repair stations in a city of a million or so people. Of the places within 75 miles, two are permanently closed. I tried online chat but closed for the day. I will try tomorrow, but I am beginning to believe buying a Panasonic item was a huge mistake."
5,"Very good ,thanks❤"
1,"My fault for not opening it before the return window closed, but panel on front was loose. All tabs broken, and so door wouldn’t shut. Very poor quality"
4,Pros: The shipping and packaging were great and the unit is a great size. Con: The power cord is very short and cannot reach my electrical sockets which are closer to the floor. An extension cord is needed.
5,"The buttons are more like this piece of plastic over a button kinda deep underneath, which I guess is with a lot of microwaves, but the whole thing moves when you try to push it. But honestly, it heats well, fits on my small apartment counter, and is pretty easy to clean! Definitely recommend."
3,"Personally feel it is overpriced. If you need a LARGE microwave, then this is a good product to purchase. Just note it is not small, so if you do not have a lot of counter space, do not buy it. Also, it does NOTHING special or extra then some of the cheaper microwaves. Unless you are just excited about the color scheme, I would say, go cheaper."
1,"I do not understand all the great reviews.  We have had this microwave for 2 years and it has never heated food up fast.  Takes a minimum of 4-5 minutes just to make things warm.  If you want it hot, you need to add more time.  I am finally reviewing this now because I need to finally replace this one.  I noticed it came up as Top Rated and want to steer anyone away from this.  Nothing speedy about warming up anything this this unit.  Bought this in 2020 and reviewed 4/2022."
4,"This is a nice little microwave. Does a good job overall. However, the settings are difficult to manage. For instance: I had to change the time on the clock. Despite following the directions in the manual to a T, I was unable to do so. Nor was my roommate. I had to call customer service to talk me through the process — a process that was _totally_  different — and much more complicated -  than the one in the manual.However, I must say that I reached customer service immediately - which is a huge plus in my book. And the person was super helpful. However, she couldn’t explain why there’s a divergence  between the manual’s directions and the directions she gave me."
2,"My 10 year old Magic Chef, bought less expensively than this Toshiba, was of far better quality than this Toshiba microwave.  The Toshiba is noisy with clinks and clangs and inside platform movement noise, and has a thin and cheap feel.  I’m very disappointed in Toshiba.  Other than the very nice modern look it has little in redeeming qualities.  Not really impressed at all with this product."
1,Died in after 2 years. Just stopped. Expensive junk now.
5,"Todo bien con el equipo, tenga en cuenta a la hora de comprar, que por lo menos a mi  me lo enviaron en la caja original, nada de protección adicional.. y por supuesto la caja llego rota, aunque el equipo parece estar bien ."
5,"This microwave is beautiful! Very sleek and professional looking, sturdy, well built. I read a lot of reviews before choosing theFarberware Professional FMO13AHTBKE 1.3 Cubic...and I made the right choice! So many great features. It also has abuilt in kitchen timer ,which is very handy. Beautiful dark gray in terrier . Love everthing about this microwave!"
5,This microwave is worth buying .
1,Did not work at all from the first moment.
1,I didn't realize that a plastic splatter shield would be too large to fit onto the glass turntable. I won't be using it as often as I thought. I'd sent it back if I could.
3,The microwave works fine.  The problem is the clock frequently reverts to 000 when I set a microwave time and press the power button.  It is extremely annoying.  I probably reset the clock 3-4 times a day.
5,Mostly used for warm-ups but I am sure that you can cook with this microwave.
2,"Totally disappointed and feeling misled - the listing reads and shows a mirrored door to the microwave as well as some kind folks had posted pictures of their beautiful mirrored mic's! Hoooowever, mine arrived just as your basic UNmirrored black edged door. It works almost alright tho a little noise of squeezing as the turntable spins while cooking - I'm seeing if that'll go away with use before I decide to return it but so far very unhappy with the microwave."
3,"The convection oven would not get above 320 Degrees , as oven thermometer placed in the oven recorded and it took too long to get to that. I baked muffins and it only reached 350 at the end of the baking time.No guide  for the use of the Combination feature  likewise for the  Convecion oven.  I would have liked some hints  for use."
5,"Overall, this Chefman Countertop Microwave Oven is a nice countertop microwave.  We've had a Chefman kettle for years that we've loved so I was familiar with the brand, however I didn't know they made microwaves. This one is nice. It's compact, easy to use and I like the display panel. It's a little louder than others I've had, but that is comparing to a built in and I wonder if being built into the cabinets muffles the sound more than the countertop ones. It includes a glass turntable that is removable for easy cleaning."
5,"Honestly the best microwave I've ever used. Maybe because it's the first brand new one, but it's quiet as heck so I love that."
3,Does what it says.If you like your items to stay looking nice run as far away from this machine as you can!!!!Got a few small splatters of food on inside & didn't catch it until later.Stainless steel did nothing and was top brand. Finally tried home remedy worked most of the way but took over 1/2 hour actively cleaning with it.  Still are spots that will not come off.
1,The worst microwave I have ever had. The ventilation does not work right and the condensation is beyond excessive. I almost burned my hand on hot water dripping from the roof. I contacted the company and got passed from person to person. I supplied all the documentation they asked. They told me it is NORMAL. Far from it. DO NOT BUY THIS.
4,"I would have given this microwave oven five stars but just under three months of use and it has started to rattle. We can’t tell where the rattle is coming from—seems like inside, somewhere in the back.Other than that, it is great, larger than some but I’m not used to having one on the counter so maybe that’s just me. I love that it has a selection of buttons for minutes (1-6) that are one touch. Also, the 30 second one touch (start) button is nice to add time to something already cooking.It’s a good purchase except for this recent rattle - which we are going to ignore."
4,"I grabbed an ""open box"" unit when I saw it listed. So, got it for a good price. Unit was new, just as described. Never unpacked, still in sealed plastic, no flaws whatsoever. Saved about half. I'm happy."
2,"After only five light and gentle weeks of use the power, 7, 8, and 9 “buttons” ceased to work and steam penetrates the seal between the door’s interior and exterior glass. The other features and appearance will hopefully last for years."
2,So this one is hard to write because I've been through enough over the past year.  It was smaller than I thought. It traps moisture and causes the inside to rust. The rust caused fire damage inside the microwave. It was a nightmare. Worst decision ever.
4,"I got this for my mom as a replacement for her old one that broke. It's smallish (countertop size) and only 700 watts (the typical low watt ones sold today are 900, with most regular family units being 1200), but this is perfect for her since she only uses it to heat tea or warm up small dishes of food. Nothing fancy, which is perfect for her"
5,Smaller microwave but matches the other ge appliances perfectly and perfect for our first apartment
2,"The unit was good looking and I was eager to start it up. Unfortunately, that's when I noticed this low drone hum followed by a loud buzzing sound. This was clearly not normal so I returned it as I suspect a defective magnetron.I will also add that the unit seemed a bit flimsy, especially the door. This alone would have served as a warning to the Farberware quality but not enough to return it.I would not recommend a Farberware microwave in the future."
1,"One day after receiving this, I gave up on trying to set the clock and called customer service. After 30 minutes the agent “found an  email” describing a manufacturing mistake in this model. Even with a warranty, they had no options for service w/o my paying shipping costs for a return. Thank goodness that Amazon cared more. With a known manufacturing malfunction, this item should have been recalled by the manufacturer! Avoid Farberware!"
4,"As I work with this oven I am more and more convinced that it is perfect for me, but I still need to learn some settings--the instruction booklet isn't great. It's a real step up from the ""heat water for a cup of tea"" or ""guess at thawing or reheating"" microwaves. After reading reviews I selected it over a more expensive one, and I'm glad I did."
5,This is one  of the best values  I gotten  lately  works well  you would  think  it's a large  one  does  every  thing  one dose  has 1100 watts  un heard of for a small  one  buy it
1,"Microwave stopped heating at any setting.  Called the warranty phone number in late August. It’s now October, 6 calls later, and they’re still telling me the Refund Department will contact me; literally “the check is in the mail”. That hasn’t happened.  They just keep reading from the same script and the poor souls have no authority to help the customer."
1,"Well it worked pretty great for the time I had it. Room, built well and easy to clean.Although within 3 months it has died completely. I am no microwave mechanic so I don't know what the issue is but for the price you pay it shouldn't be dead within in 3 months lmao."
1,"I bought this item twice based on brand name. On the first machine, the door would not close properly and therefore nothing worked except the interior light which would not shut off. Returned for a refund. After trying to find a similar product from other manufactures, I ordered another machine. This one at least worked but the front trim continues to fall off (double sided tape used to hold trim in place). Typical Chinese quality control garbage. The microwave, air fryer and convection functions seem to work fine, but my confidence in this product is not high due to the quality control issue. I've only had it for about a week, just not sure how long it will last."
1,"1st one arrived with the door frame scuffed all around. Reordered the exact same microwave hoping that it was a one-off.  2nd one had the same issue, although only 2 corners were affected.  Nothing wrong with the box or packaging.  Strange.Will not try again."
5,works great thanks
4,"Super powerful. Looks great. Love everything about it, EXCEPT for the super loud beeps at the end that you can't turn off. SERIOUSLY FIVE BEEPS. I always try to catch it before the beeping starts. Has anyone found a fix for this? The manual offers no help."
2,It didn't even last a year! Horrible!
1,"I bought this model specifically because you can turn the beeps off which stops the individual keys from beeping at you hit them as well as the end of any cycle -- no noise.  Don't have to worry about waking the house up in the morning with the microwave beeping.  I wish it were quieter in general and there is an ever-so-slight rattle of the outside metal 'skin' of the microwave, which I need to address - hoping to just tighten some screws underneath.  It functions otherwise identical to my last one.  Love the bright LED lights inside on the side.  It's 900 watts so it won't be superfast, but I needed a small one for my counter, so it takes a few more seconds to heat things.I am updating my review:  Not quite one year into light use by a senior citizen and the microwave has decided not to acknowledge any of the buttons - so with no time entered and door closed, it keeps running -- you cannot stop it unless you unplug it.  It no longer function as a microwave.  I see there are the same complaints on here now but with having to ship back a microwave - between packaging it, lugging it to a post office and paying the freight - and MAYBE Toshiba will admit they have a defect in the electronic control panel and bear freight charges -- just seems way too costly.  I would recommend NOT buying this unit and shopping further."
5,It fits my small space perfectly.  It is very quiet.  It works very much like my old one so no need to learn new programing.
3,Plastic covering over numbers is coming loose.
2,The microwave stopped working
1,I take very good care of all appliances. This just died after 2 years. Never had a microwave die on me ever. Even had one that was 10 years old that still worked and I gave it away. Maybe I got a bad one.
1,"I'll keep this short.  I ordered 2 new B&D 900 watt ovens ""back to back"" during July in an attempt to get the oven I wanted.  In both cases, the ovens were dented even though the shipping boxes showed no apparent damage.  The first one was so bent that it would not sit flat on the countertop.  The second was dented on one side.  Someone at B&D had even put a piece of tape next to the damage on the 2nd oven, so the factory was aware of the damage to the unit.  In each case, I had to repackage the unit and haul it to UPS for the return .., ugh.  Perhaps my experience was an isolated one since I see lots of positive reviews of this unit, but ""twice bitten, thrice shy"".  You might want to try a different brand if you're looking for a small microwave."
4,"I've had the microwave about a week.Pros:So far I'm pleased with the cooking functionality. It is reasonably quiet, spacious, and nicely styled. The owner's manual is excellent - informative and very easy to understand.Cons:Although there is a light inside when it is cooking, it is difficult to see what's going on inside as the light is not extremely bright and the protective screening blocks a lot of the view. I'm comparing this to my previous microwave that was much easier to see the food as it cooks.Although it does beep when done, this is more of a personal peeve -  doesn't have a visual indicator. My last one did as sometimes. I'll put something in there to warm, walk away and forget about it. The indicator was useful, as you can't really see what's inside, it would remind me that it had finished and to look inside."
2,The ring that sits under the rotating glass is cracked making  it difficult to function.  The legs are uneven and requires some inventive additions to one leg to make the unit sit level. Very disappointed in both these issues and the fact that it could take months to get a replacement for the broken ring.
4,This is a good capacity microwave. I like that it has 6 presents. I really like that it has the child lock feature for safety. Very modern looking since it's stainless steel and it's a nice size. Makes about the same amount noise as a regular microwave but it has a mute button. Cool for those late night snackers. This is a top notch microwave and the extra features are worth it!
5,"Build quality is mid-tier as expected, and looks modern and neat to the first glance, even the next. Light, yet feels durable. Decided to heat a Danish up for about 10-15 seconds just to warm and soften it up a bit, but I did not expect such a short amount of time would make it warmer than expected. Even heats up soup and turkey bacon in quite the hurry, and very efficiently at that. It's a bit on the noisy side initially, but quiets down after the first couple seconds. The surface doesn't attract much heat at all, even after extensive use, which is great for the surface it sits on and the items you may have around it."
2,"This died in 22 months of use, which is frustrating.Also, the model beeps once and stops -- often we heat something up and forget it because it only beeps once. Will not buy this again."
2,I bought this beauty looking at all the bells and whistles...and EVERYTHING overcooks despite me turning down the cook time. everything boils over in bowls i used for my previous microwave and i cant remove anything without pot holders...the steam that hits you in the face when you open the door can burn your eyes....gonna send back....not sure if i should just go with another brand
2,"Good size, does not take up too much space, but it does not heat up food well. Will be returning."
4,Like all the cooking functions and  rate it a 4 Because it is very noisy
3,"Our plates do not fit in without turning them sideways, so check to make sure the measurements will work for you."
2,Have had a month and some numbers aren't working on keypad.
5,Like everything!  Easy use and right size. It fits 9 in. Glass pie pan with glass lid so perfect for reheat
5,It heats up your food fast. Has 5 different settings..
3,"I wanted to love this microwave. •Sleek flat front design. •Elegant, monochromatic panel.  •Updated, even-cooking feature. •The auto warm/done feature sounds very nice, but does require extra effort to manually program the unit and to carefully cover the food with a fitted and vented lid or plastic wrap.  •It heats the food fast. •It’s roomy enough for my full size dinner plates and big bowls. >PROBLEMATIC: •The large plug, and short, super stiff cord protrude too much from the wall, a problem since my outlet is not behind the unit. >THE DEAL BEAKERS: There is no quick-touch, 1-5 minute, cooking feature. •The “30 second“ button is not a one-touch, but also requires the start button. •The “30 second” button can be repeatedly pressed to reach up to 5 minutes, but beeps...e v e r y...s i n g l e (10 annoying times) press of the button. •Unit continues beeping (FIVE loud-in-your-ear times) when finished, even after you open the door. •There is not a no-sound feature. >CONCLUSION: Sad to report that for the simple, reheating and super non-fussy manner, in which we use a MW, this is not for us."
4,"This Panasonic's features are a huge upgrade from our older microwave.  We especially like the Inverter technology and sensor re-heat function which is easy to use and greatly improves the quality of our leftovers - no overcooking while always achieving a good temperature.  This is a versatile appliance at a reasonable price.  I'd have given it a 5-star rating except that in our kitchen the glare on the face of the microwave makes it difficult to read the clock/timer, and fingerprints are always visible unless cleaned after each usage."
5,"We got this one to replace a 1200 watt monster oven we'd had for 15 years. We don't really cook in ours, just heat up water, nuke frozen vegetables, or reheat yesterday's pizza. It works just fine for that, although it takes a little longer than the super powered unit we had before. No big deal.I really like the smaller footprint. Our older oven dominated the countertop. This is a much better size for us.It has plenty of built in settings but is very intuitive to use. The model shipped to us has the same keypad design as the one shown, but with an easier to see design. Time for Amazon to update the picture.One improvement: I would like to see this made with high traction rubber feet, possibly height adjustable. The feet are hard plastic and don't grip on a Formica countertop, so unless the oven is up against a wall, pushing the button to open the door will move this lightweight oven. A buck or three at the hardware store got me little press on rubber cup feet which did the trick. To be fair, most microwaves don't have high traction feet. We had to use those adhesive felt pads on our old unit, and any oven that doesn't weigh a ton will get pushed around by pressing door button or by pulling open the handle."
4,"The clock lights are green, not blue. I don't like false advertising. The blue lights advertised in the Amazon pictures would be so much nicer. That is very disappointing.The inside is black and gloomy. It would be nicer if the inside was white.There are too many unnecessary buttons which make the controls look crowded (all those food buttons, like ""Fish"" and ""Meat"" aren't necessary to me).But the platinum & white exterior is exquisite. It's a beautiful and stylish color that really works (but would be so much nicer if it had the blue clock lights as advertised).I give it 3 1/2 to 4 stars."
4,"Great product for the price, from Amazon’s Warehouse Deals. Brand new but I got a discount due to it being sold with a damaged box.  The only complaint with this model is the push-button open feature.  I have to hold the microwave every time I open it’s door; otherwise, the whole thing gets pushed towards the back of the counter!  I wish it had a bar-style open/close handle, instead."
5,"This is a great size, it’s easy to use, and it heats evenly. It looks very nice too"
5,"Works great. The large 16"" turntable is big enough to handle a turkey. It's powerful, so read the instructions carefully. We use ours every day."
5,"I needed a small microwave to fit the small kitchen we just moved to. This was listed as one of the best models (consumer reviews) but the reviews on Amazon were not so great. I just took a chance and got this anyway and I am so glad I did. It’s quiet and I love the feature to turn off the beeping! It’s not as powerful as our last one but it does the job. We only use this to reheat but do use it everyday. So far so good and it’s been several months of daily use. Even if it dies after a year, I think for the price it is a good buy. Will update if it breaks before a year."
5,"It was time for an upgrade,  easy to understand.  Several settings for all types of food."
3,I found that the Toshiba directions were unclear about how to use the convection oven. There are no clear instructions on the internet on how to use it either. The products out on the market don’t tell you how to use it either.
1,"Do not buy this microwave for anything over $75.00 dollars. For one thing it's not even made right. The metal shield that covers the sides and top is not molded right. It is lifted on the top right front and back corner. The keypad is not accurate, when you press the number you want sometimes the number next to it comes up, sometimes the keypad resets for no reason. The microwave is so light that every time you open up the door the microwave moves towards you. You have to open the door quickly or hold the microwave so it doesn't move. What manufacturer in their right mind uses hard plastic as feet to hold it in place, I guess a softer material to hold the microwave in place was more expensive. The only thing this unit does is heat food. If you can live with all the things I mentioned above then buy it, but don't pay more than $75.00 for it until they fix all the issues."
1,It worked well for two years and now it shuts off on it own and will not cook properly.  The electronic screen just goes out at times.
5,Love the look of the appliance!  Very simple to use and love popping popcorn in it.!
3,I feel like I received a refurbished microwave
2,"I knew when I bought this, that it would take longer to heat things than I'm used to, but it's very weak: takes over 4 minutes to boil 1 cup of water.My bigger problem is that it seems very cheaply made.  I've had this it for 3 months, and will be surprised if it lasts another 3.From the start, the plastic coating over the keypad doesn't lay smoothly, and there's a small bubble in the plastic coating on the inside of the microwave's door.About 2 weeks ago, it began to make increasingly loud noises when in use; it sounds like the turntable is the source.My advice: save your money and buy a better product."
5,Needed a smaller compact microwave for my countertop cabinet and it fit like a glove. Perfect size
3,"My microwave fits on a shelf made for microwaves in my remodeled kitchen. The bumped out back was in line with the electrical outlet and the microwave’s 1 1/2 plug so it did not set on he shelf. A flat extension cord was purchased and an electrician installed a recessed plug then it just fit. Clock hard to read for a short 5’2” me. Instruction book requires a Master’s degree to use and comprehend. Oh wait, I have a Master’s degree and it’s still too much. Would return it but too much hassle to return an online purchase."
3,"Don’t know what the average lifespan of these microwaves are – – this lasted four years until last night when I turned it on it started sparking inside. The digital number display also stopped working a few months ago. Was good appliance, easy to use, small footprint, pretty good power, not loud, but I will likely try another brand for this next purchase."
1,This microwave was a perfect size and wattage for what I needed it for. It stopped working after a week and a half. Very upset. I’m not sure if this was a defective one or not. Save the box if you purchase this microwave. Because you might have to return it shortly there after. I was so glad it happened while I was in my return window. Otherwise I would’ve paid $$$ for an item that became worthless.  Very disappointing.
3,"Works as advertised, compact and fits nicely into limited space,HOWEVER, the beeping alert is very loud and can’t be reduced nor disabled. It’s priced right so it might be something you can live with. I’ll try!"
2,"It was a good microwave for a while. But now the inside gives off an electric spark when it cooks. It doesn’t matter whether the dishware is ceramic, glass or plastic. It sparks. I’m afraid it will cause a house fire. I’m going to have to get rid of it. Which is really frustrating"
1,I liked that it fit the space I needed.  There were very few options for that size.  Really disappointed about all of the rust that happened after less than two years ownership.
5,Faberware Microwave reviews were read before purchasing & works great!
4,"I really like this microwave. Since it’s 1200 watts, it’s so much faster. The only complaint is that the numbers are very difficult to read because they only a shade or two lighter than the panel."
2,"I bought this specific model number because I wanted a bright LED light in the microwave so that I can monitor my food better than the old fashioned, somewhat dim incandescent bulbs. Unfortunately, the LED started flickering 6 months in, then finally died around the 8 month mark.No problem, I thought. I will just find the replacement bulb and change it out. Boy, was I wrong. The LED is actually a small circuit board soldered in. No bulb to replace. Ok, find the replacement led assembly.  The company in charge of parts for Toshiba, Encompass, did not have the part.Please Toshiba North America, fix this problem. In theory, yes the LED should outlast the microwave and I understand why you would solder it in.  This may fall on deaf ears but...... (SOLUTION) Please either put use an E-17 lamp socket  so that the bulbs can be replaced or get better LED light assemblies installed in your microwaves!Just noticed..... there are at least 8-10 other reviews with bad LED's!I am currently out of  a job due to the Corvid-19 outbreak. If you need help with product testing and development, please contact me as I am available for hire."
4,"This item works as expected, but it also has a weird buzz that doesn't seem normal. Sometimes the buzz isn't there right away, but it usually starts after a few seconds of cooking. The sound is sort of like an electrical shorting sound, but it hasn't caused an issue so far and there isn't an electrical burning smell, so I keep using it. But it does have me a little worried."
2,This is a cheep microwave. No way to put in my own time.Not happy.
4,"You're probably reading this to see what people think... Is it good or bad. So here's the scoop. I had to get a replacement sent due to a defect in the first. The second one has a door that's not level but it works...Well, so the microwave works. It also has the oven and airfry features but I find that it takes SO long to airfry thing I've not tried it. I did try the pizza, to oven it, and it was ok once you removed microwave insert and glass plate. Knowing I have to store that somewhere while using the baking removable parts. (metal tray- no good for the microwave.)"
1,This microwave smokes every single time we use it. And we only use it for reheating leftovers a few times a week for 1-2 min. At this point we are waiting for it to die
2,"Product has functions of multiple appliances, but they don't work as well as the individual appliances might.  Microwave is O.K. but slower than others of comparable size and power.  Convection oven is disappointing (slow to heat and takes only small pans), and air fry is limited to auto settings for small amounts of food.  The instructions are terrible and make it very difficult to use some of the features - I had to view some online videos (not from the manufacturer) to see how to use the air fry (there are no instructions for using the air fry pan and rack).  And, seriously - 35 minutes to air-fry 8 ounces of frozen french fries?  That's what the automatic setting shows.  If it weren't such a hassle to pack up and return, I would have done that once I realized its limitations."
1,"After ordering this I decided to look at the reviews and oh boy was I nervous to receive it! One I got it, the box was fine, undamaged then I open it up and I see a dent at the top of it!! This lets me know that this was intentional!! Hopefully the replacement is decent !!!"
4,"I have to say it is the most beautiful microwave I have ever owned, and matches my red kitchen aid mixer.  However, it was a challenge for me to learn how to operate it.  The instructions were worthless.  It took 2 telephone calls to daughters in both Michigan and Florida and they went on line and tried to help me over the phone.  Then one came to visit me and we finally have it going.  I really like it now, but it took abit of patience.  I am 79 and some of technology passes me by.  But it is a good product."
1,"I recently just purchased this microwave in comparison to other manufacturers because of its reviews and number of buyers, however when I got the microwave I tried to open the door and it would pop out as other microwaves. I thought it was just the features so I manually open the door put a item to test the microwave it turned the timer on but no sound, did a few research online and it appears I got a faulty microwave. After spending a considerable amount on the microwave and waitng for the shipping one would hope for a functioning equipment, I haven't contacted Panasonic or Amazon yet but I hope to get some assistance in regrads to a replacement or money back"
4,It would be nice if it continued to beep lick the old one.  It’s easy to miss the timer or forget you put something in.
3,"I purchased this microwave just before  moving to a new home that did not have a built-in microwave. When I received the box, I just put it with my other belongings to pack and move but did not open the box until I had arrived in my new home.  When I arrived at my new home, the box was in perfect condition, however when I opened it up the handle was broken off of the door of the microwave. Unfortunately I was beyond the window to return it but my son-in-law was able to reattach the handle using a strong epoxy and it is held up since then. Other than that I really like the microwave it works well and has nice features. The only other issue I've noticed is that the touchpad buttons seem a little bit small so I have to be very mindful of what one I am pressing."
4,"For the price its a great product. My old micro decided to give its last ""BEEP"" so it was time for a replacement. The Black and Decker is easy to use and straight forwards. I enjoy the ""add 30 seconds"" feature adding time to be and ease. Keep in mind that this is a smaller size micro so large plates/cups are not going to fit, though average size should fit juist fine."
1,"Returning to this order two years out to report that the microwave started sparking on the right side wall during every use. Ran it three times and it happened on all three runs, so obviously not going to try for a fourth. Had to toss it. Didn't show any signs of wear up until this recent failure."
2,"Then I took it out of the box.  The display went flaky (switched out of Time mode) within 2 months.  Never did make the clock continue to work for more than a week after that.  Then if less than 100% power is selected, it intermittently would stop prematurely without a sound or indication.  The convection oven never achieved 375 Deg F.  Then at 14 months EVERYTHING QUIT except the internal light bulb.  WoW.  Two months out of warranty and its dead.  COOL."
5,"Good power and it seems well made.We gave ours a bit of a retro look by adding some atomic starbursts I cut from scraps of peel-and-stick vinyl. See the pictures. The round ends were made with a 1/8-inch hole punch. The stripes are about 1/16"" wide.Yes there is a piece of cardboard in the oven covering the vent, and the instructions say to not remove it. It feels water-resistant though. I don't think it will be a problem.The oven slides around a bit on a laminate counter top. You have to hold the oven while pressing buttons, or pull it back into position afterwards.It doesn't automatically add 60 or 30 seconds when you press cook again like some ovens do. But it's easy enough to set the time and press cook.The light comes on when you open the door. And it stays on while cooking. The oven does beep to remind you there's food still in there after cooking."
5,Really love the wattage and size
1,"This is among my worst purchases ever!!  I was so excited to get a new microwave, which is probably pathetic.  But I was so sick of seeing my old microwave that was dirty and being lazy I figured getting a new one would beat cleaning that old one!!I got this microwave and set it up and right away it blew a fuse.  It did that several times.  When it didn't blow a fuse it did what it wanted to do instead of what I programmed it to do.  I tried the preset buttons and none of them worked.  My old microwave is probably over 10 years old and never given me a problem.  But after spending $200 on this piece of junk I had nothing but problems!Thankfully Amazon is one an amazing vendor to work with on returns.  They took it back and I went back to using my decade old microwave that actually works."
1,Right out of the box the door would not open and the button to open the door stuck in. Sent back for refund.
2,Nice looking microwave but the ‘microwaves’ are targeted on one particular spot that tends to leave the inner and outer edge of a dish of food cold while drying out the mid circle of food. Weird but not impressed
5,"Awesome microwave.  Quiet, powerful, fast, and balance cooking through out the food. I would buy one with the same specs and brand.  Paid a little more, but it was worth it!"
3,"I had to purchase this item three times before it was right.  First time damaged in shipping, the back of the microwave was caved in.  The second one came with no damage during shipping but the front control panel was hanging off, not secured properly at manufacture. The third one seems to be fine, is working correctly and there are no real issues.  I am now scrutinizing so closely I have noticed a bit of a flaw in the screen between the door window but really not noticeable so I am keeping this one.Overall the microwave looks good, seems to be heating evenly and the price was right.  I will update if any issues arise."
4,"Looks great with my stainless steel kitchen, and leaves some space on counter.Watch out it gets hot. I limit use to under 12 minutes and then it feels too hot to use it a second time.Easy clean, weekly with just a paper towel or two. So far so good. It's keypad is the annoying kind where when you hit a 1 it autocooks for one minutes, and a 5 would be auto start cook for five minutes. That annoys me because I would rather be able to enter 3-5-2 to get three minutes and twenty five seconds etc.I would also rather not have to worry it getting to hot in summer because the heat carries through into the house environment."
5,Lower power than my previous brand but adequate. They proclaim it is a lower power microwave. I use mine mostly for coffee and it takes about 15 seconds longer. I'm ok with that as this is a nice looking unit and good value.
5,"I had my old microwave for nearly 15 years and it still worked great, but I decided to change my color scheme in the kitchen to stainless steel apllicances. This microwave was my last new addition and I took some time researching various models, features and sizes that were compatible with my old one. I'm glad I discovered this Panasomic model. Not only does it weigh a lot less than my old one, but the dimensions were a bit smaller, yet the inside was bigger than my old one... if you can figure that out. The buttons were very easy to use and after watching some of the Amazon videos attached to it, when I first used it, it felt like second nature to me. I would definitely recommend this model to anyone looking for a new one."
3,"I have been in a bad luck streak for a few months with appliances just going bad . First hot water tank , then the fridge and now my not so old microwave.The day I got my fridge fixed after 4 months my microwave died . I really needed one super fast and read as many reviews as I could . My husband came home from the hospital after being in a coma and on a ventilator, so he was in need of one quick .I thought this could be the answer to our needs , but as I said “I thought,”The Alexa app hardly worked properly, but when it did it was great . We worked around that issue . Then we kept noticing one thing , each time we used this we had trouble with the internet and that’s where I just hate this thing . I wish I never hooked that part up . I have tried to take this off but I can’t figure it out .If I could do over and how I wish I could , I would just never have this connected to the internet .This cooks fairly good , not great , but workable. Things are either cooked not hot enough or too much . Maybe when my life slows down I can figure it out and find out what could be wrong .If you are looking for something to mess up your internet then you have found just what you are looking for . Would I say this is worth buying , not on your life . Maybe I’m just stupid , but I think this isn’t right ."
4,Thought it would have been bigger from pictures but in all great product
1,"I had it for two weeks and it does take a bit longer to cook food than what I’m used to using.I put a larger baked potato in the oven tonight and I said the time cook for five minutes and before the timer went off the whole apartment was full of smoke and I open the door of the microwave and the potato was on fire and completely charred there was no paper nothing in there I just put it on that plate or turntable. Obviously, that’s not supposed to happen after two weeks.Returning to Kohl’s tomorrow.  I should’ve listened to my instinct told me not to get Farberware because they’re not noted for their microwaves."
5,Perfect for a small space. Great value. Not really full-sized but fine for small jobs.
1,We purchased this for my in-laws for Christmas last December and the control board went out 8 months later
2,The box came in perfect condition but when I took it out of the box it had a huge dent on the side
3,The depth on the product description says 20.5” but it does not account for the 3” hump on the backside of the microwave. You will need at least 23”-25” of depth counter space to fit this microwave.I had to return mine because of this though it would have been a nice appliance to own.
2,"I was very happy with the appearance of the microwave but as soon as I plugged it in to heat up some water, it was so loud and kept rattling. Returned it today."
1,"The light is too damn bright. The alert sounds are too damn loud. Display buttons are boring. Door makes a horrific sound when closed, it can wake up sleeping elephants and the dead!"
4,"Right out of the box, everything was in order, except, there is a small brown plastic drive mechanism which fits into the drive shaft which turns the glass table .... this brown part was too loose on the shaft (shaft is hidden), so it dropped in over the shaft so much that it was too low and could not engage the corresponding slots and dogs  under the glass table, rendering the turntable non-functional, and reason for return.I did not return the unit, instead, I took a small piece (approx 1 inch square) of the wrapping plastic, laid it over the hole in the brown piece as I pressed the brown piece into the shaft (thus created a ""bushing"" between the shaft and hole), only far enough so as engage the glass turntable.Its been over a week and it works as intended, we use it many times a day.So, the overall rating is 4, instead of 5 because of this lack of adequate QC. I think the ordinary consumer would have returned this product.Its quiet, heats well and fits in a shelf which I had built for my old m/w oven."
4,I like it
3,I'm not too happy right now.  I've had it just over a week or so. I find that the timing is way off from my old Sharp.  3 strips of turkey bacon used to take exactly 2 min 20 seconds.  Now it burns to a crisp by 2 minutes. The containers are a lot hotter than the old one. The numbers are very hard to see. They are black on black and hard to push on. Maybe there is a trick that I haven't figured out just yet as to how to get the oven to start by pushing the button just once to get it started. I don't know how hard to clean yet as I haven't had the occasion to do so yet. The microwave pizza is hard when Iuse the time specified on the box it came in. It's also louder than the old one and it sounds like it cycles rather than just hearing a steady sound. The manual is written in very poor English so it's a bit confusing as to what it is actually telling you to do. It was probably written by someone without a command of the English language who didn't realize how confusing their writing was.  I'll either get used to it in a month of use or I'll be so discouraged that I'll try to return it.  I don't know how hard it is to return something this big to Amazon as I haven't done it before.
2,After 2 days the rotating glass plare quit.
2,"I loved everything about this microwave convection oven, but after two months the turntable makes a strange & loud wabbling noise. I've adjusted the inner plate and circle ring with rollers but its not that.  It's coming from the internal mechanism that turns the plate. Very DISAPPOINTED, since I did a long search to find a good long lasting microwave convection oven after the Frigidaire brand i had constantly broke & had to have repaired many times. It will probably cost the same amount as the microwave to get this one repaired."
5,"I wasn't too sure about this microwave, but I actually love it.  It has an air fryer feature, (plus  a few more I haven't used yet) which is great!!  I've used that a few times and once you get the hang of it, you will love it.  Very easy to use.  Make sure you get the instruction booklet with it, or you will have to contact Amazon, to download it for you.  Definitely would purchase again."
4,So far so good.
1,This microwave is the worse . I wish I can return and have my money back or exchange with a good one. I make a big mistake to buy it . Please help me to refund or exchange. Thanks
3,"I seldom give less than 4 stars and, even then, there must be something obviously wrong. I guess ""It stopped working!"" is wrong enough for just 3 stars. Let me explain. I bought the RCA RMW733-BLACK Microwave Oven about six months ago. Delivery was great, as expected with Amazon. I liked it when I got it. I liked it when I first used it. And I liked it for the next six months. At less than $10 per month, then, I can hardly complain about the price. But this morning, it stopped working. It just stopped. The LEDs went dark. The control panel wouldn't respond. I've been around a bit. The first thing I checked was the power. Nope. That was on. Externally everything looked OK. I'm not about to open the case to see what internal fuse needs replacing or resetting. And I'm not interested in packing it up and shipping it back on the hopes of some kind of warranty fix. It's not worth my time, considering the price. What I will do, however, is purchase another microwave oven. Just not this brand."
2,"Update to my original review.  Unfortunately, it is not any better than my first impression of this device.  Now that the bulb has blown out I come to find it is not able to be replaced.  I called the toll free # in the back of the user guide and the nice lady told me that this model does not have a way to replace the appliance bulb, to take it to a small appliance store to see if they have the tools required to do the job. Disappointed.  This is a safety concern.  I reached in to remove a cup of coffee I reheated and since I was unable to clearly see where I was reaching I knocked the cup over spilling the hot contents on my hand and all over the inside of the microwave.  I hope no one gets seriously burned because of this design flaw.  Just sayin'.1st review:  I'm not really happy with the flimsy quality.  The door doesn't line up with number panel and there's a dent in the top. The color is not as bright as I was hoping for either. Disappointed."
4,I’m very happy with this purchase.  It’s a good microwave.  I do wish I had purchased one with a handle as opposed to the button to open it.  But I’m happy with my purchase.
3,"The user manual is barely anything (just 1 page directions for the air fryer function). It’s like the manual writers were directed to be ‘minimal’ like the tech companies but failed to understand how the product actually worked and took that as an excuse to not do anything.The online instructions are barely helpful either, mainly just warranty or product info. Other than that, we manage to get by with the air fryer and microwave with a lot of trial and error. Sadly, the biggest pro on this product is that it saves countertop space."
3,"I bought this microwave just about two years ago. It cooked slower than my older one, understandably, I was willing to give up power for size convenience. But I already have to get rid of it. The inside is all cracked and flaking off, exposing what looks like metal below? I expect a microwave to last more than two years."
5,"When my identical GE microwave finally bit the dust (after three good years of very heavy daily use) on the first Amazon Prime Day (October 10, 2023), I was very happy to buy the exact same model, again, as a Prime Day deal! This has been the best, most reliable workhorse of a microwave that I have ever owned (since the late 1970s). It is also one of the least expensive gems to ever grace my kitchen. Buying it again was a no-brainer for me!"
1,"Plugged it in, was running for 1 minute, all of a sudden it went dark. No display,no light, no beep to signal end of cooking time. Unplugged it, thought maybe it overheated, plugged it back in after 5 minutes…nothing. Outlet worked fine for everything else."
3,mainly reheating and we ordered panasonic and this one is toshiba
5,"Just got this last week, and so far really like it.  It doesn't have a handle on the door, which some reviewers of other microwaves say causes it to slide on the counters, even when well anchored.This one has the large button you press to open the door which I'm used to. No sliding.I agree with others it's lacking a more detailed instruction book, which would be handy for the air fryer and convection feature.  But I'll just pull this off the web."
4,"I didn't read the information correctly.  It is 700 watts, but I thought it was 1200 watts.  I made it work, until I moved,  then I gave it away.  Just be aware of watts."
2,"the first day that I opened the package and set it up it looked great, however, when I open the door the handle BROKE!"
2,the control panel peeling already keeps getting worse with each use
4,Great product for price. Have only had it a short period of time. Have to get used to the longer cook times but it will get the job done.
1,"This microwave did not heat at all!!!! Unfortunately I bought it and set it up in my daughter's college dorm room. Then I got on a plane and flew back across the country. Of course she calls several days later to say it does not heat anything at all. I called Amazon customer service to say my dilemma and they were no help. Now I am stuck with a microwave that doesn't work, and a college freshman that really needs a microwave. DO NOT buy this one - and probably not one form Amazon. But from a company that will help you!"
4,"Works well, great for small kitchen. My only complaint is that it started sqeaking a little when it rotates, about a month in, but it works perfectly fine. The auto-heat options aren't useful at all, but who really uses those?"
4,It seems to microwave food a lot quicker than the instructions on a particular dinner indicate to set the time for.  By the time I open up the door the food is very hot and steaming.  But I specifically follow the instructions on the dinner as to the length of time.
4,"Was looking to replace our 10 year old Microwave and wanted to look at getting the convection features as well.  This oven was very easy to set up and use.  Easy to pick up how to either microwave or convection cook.  Large capacity, and the included convection racks are useful and can hold 2 pounds of salmon fillets or 40 meatballs.My only 2 issues are: 1) Difficult to clean inside.  With convection cooking there is a lot of splatter and with the exposed convection coil on the top of the oven it is difficult to clean the ceiling. And with all of the holes punched in the sides for airflow, you have to be careful not to use too much liquid in your sponge/paper towel or it oozes through the holes.  Yet with all of the grease, you need a lot of soap to clean it.  2) You will learn quickly that if you plan to convection oven a meal and then microwave the veg, you can't use a microwavable bag as the entire oven (including the glass tray) is now 425 degrees and you'll melt any plastic you put in it.  You have to plan to microwave in glass or just stovetop cook your veg.One other warning.  We like to leave butter on the counter to keep it soft.  We keep it in a ceramic tray/lid.  Made the mistake of setting that on top of the unit when convection cooking and the heat from the cabinet transferred up through the ceramic tray and melted the bottom 10% of the stick of butter.  Don't leave anything on top of the stove!!"
4,"Microwaves have been around for decades -- so why go backwards in technology?  There are no ""express"" buttons, so to put in for 1 minute, you need to put punch in 1 - 0 - 0 and ""start.""  You can use ""add 30""  twice, but that button is hard to see while the unit is resting on the countertop, so I ended up affixing a large colored dot with ""30"" on it.-- And push each button hard each time because the buttons are not very touch sensitive.  You sometimes end up having to re-enter times because you didn't push hard enough on each number the first time.-- My poor mother is so flummoxed by this microwave that I have to operate it for her.  And how said is that?"
5,"Love this microwave! It looks great, I’m a fan of the stainless steel. Has all the microwave feature you need…I mainly just heat up food, so I don’t need anything fancy. This microwave is perfect for me!"
4,"Update 4/9/2021. On 4/1/2021 a new version of MSmartLife app was released which fixed this problem. The Alexa interface is now working again.Was very happy, 5 stars, with this microwave and it worked well from day 1 until a software update in ""MSmartLife"" (a required phone app to interface between the Alexa Toshiba Skill and the microwave) on 3/1/2021. Now, Alexa simply says: ""Hmmm, microwave is not responding"". You should read the reviews of the Alexa Toshiba Skill (Alexa phone app->Skills->Toshiba Microwave) which has not been updated since 01/2020 and you will see many other customers having the same problem. Got this microwave for my blind mother; she can no longer use it."
4,"I ordered this microwave after redoing my kitchen. We had a larger, GE microwave that also served as the oven hood. With that gone, we needed a countertop unit, not too large but still powerful enough to heat food properly. This one serves its purpose. Despite its small footprint, it is efficient. I like its appearance and the door handle, the interior light, the ease of controls. Its only downside is that it is noisier than I expected. The door could be designed for less of a thud and the unit's operation generally is noisy. Still, given the price and the stated efficiency, I would buy it again and recommend it. Update: Having read about the LED light failure, I purchased an extended warranty!"
4,Got this as open box to replace my previous Panasonic one I loved .. until my son microwaved a chicken patty for SIXTEEN MINUTES ….. just wasn’t the same after so decided to replace it. This one does the job for sure .. but it is pretty loud. First thing we all noticed. The vent blows some pretty strong wind out the side also .. not bad or anything .. just something I noticed.Overall not a bad microwave. It does the job. Just do wish it was but quieter. Maybe I’ll try a chicken patty for 16 minutes and see if it passes the test ……
5,"It was time to toss out our old energy guzzling microwave and replace it with one that has more options and less energy. This one fits the bill. It is very energy efficient and heats up a variety of food in seconds as expected. But unlike our old one, it has pre-set buttons and different cooking cycles. The stainless steel is much nicer and easy to clean too. It is fairly large (16x20) and takes up a lot of counter space so if your kitchen is small, you may want to consider another size."
4,"Everything is fine except popcorn setting.  If you leave the popcorn in for the entire cycle, it will burn.  Therefore we have to manually use time settings manually."
4,"This microwave holds large items easily and is easy to program. My only complaint is the door release button. On other microwaves I've had, the button pops the door open. On this unit, the button releases the door, but you have to use your other hand to pull the door open. I don't know if this is a manufacturing defect or by design, but either way it is very annoying. I would have given 5 stars otherwise."
4,"I replaced the exact model last month and purchased a new one. Be aware that the inside paint started chipping off of my old one after about 2 years. So this microwave only lasted me 2.5 years. I still purchased the exact same model to replace it because I love the outside of it, it's not too large and it works well... until it doesn't. So don't expect this to last 5-10 years.  Expect 2-3 years. If this isn't long enough for you, don't buy it."
2,"I have had this unit for less than 30 days.First off, no manual was a pain.Second, even with the manual, it's sort of complicated.  I have yet to use the air fryer successfully.  Unless you push the correct buttons quickly, it reverts to microwave function.  I mainly use it for microwave fortunately.  Hopefully I get the hang of airfryer one day.Thirdly I went to use it today and the inside light would not work.  I took the llittle cover off inside but found no bulb.  Nothing in the manual about light. Customer service, GE, transferred me three diff numbers.  What I was finally told was that I would have to return to vendor and the return date would be determined by vendor policy.  GE would replace it, but I would have to buy another one and then apply for a certificate showing I bought a new one.  The GE rep said all small appliances have that policy.  There was no place I could take for a repair at their expense.I'm old and it would entail lots of work to get this returned.  I can't even lift it.Since there is  no backlight on the key pad, a flashlight is necessary anyway.  I guess I'll also use the flashlight to look inside the unit."
1,Fix daylight savings time or leave the time setting alone!  for love of all that's holy!  Please!  Think of the children!
4,"Overall like the product, would have liked a slightly bigger inside dimension."
2,"It works.. what else do we need, right?My only big gripe is that I (most of the time) cannot use any keypad numbers until I press Stop/Reset.  I tried different approaches (especially letting the last cycle end by itself) to see if there was a way to avoid having to click Stop/Reset before clicking anything else, but no luck.  So, it’s annoying that I have to click Stop/Reset in order to enter a cook time…it’s notable that sometimes this isn’t the case."
1,It is exactly 1 month and three days after I bought this microwave and it is burning from the inside. The rubber that holds the glass tray melted. I cannot return because it’s past the 1 month period. How convenient for them.
3,I've only had this microwave oven for a couple months a d I just don't know...It seems to work great at times yet it sometimes seems like there is something wrong with with the oven...since day one. I reviewed microwave ovens for at least 6 months and chose this particular oven for many reasons. The majority of reviews said this microwave was very quiet but I have to disagree. Only time will tell how long it will last but I have my doubts.
4,Our previous microwave stopped working. Got this smaller one.  The power and design are fine.  No complaints.  But the smaller door and flimsier rotating platform are less convenient than for physically larger model.
5,"I searched and searched for a microwave that would fit the shelf in my kitchen to replace an old one.  Found this one and absolutely love it.  Inside is big enough to fit a full size plate and the outside is sleek and has all the appropriate buttons, settings etc.  I am really happy with it."
1,"Just got the microwave out of the box, set it up per the manual and it won't heat food"
5,My original first microwave was a Panasonic I replaced it with a sharp carousel and now that that has died the new Panasonic with the sensor program is a standout ! the best I've ever owned and I'm 70 so I've owned quite a few since the day they came out
1,"The media could not be loaded.I don’t like this product because it doesn’t work !  I wasted my funds and my time getting it . The microwave cuts on as soon as you plug it in but it doesn’t cut off or get the food hot ! The numbers don’t work on it as well , it don’t let you heat anything up better yet turn it off without unplugging . I would like a full refund for this waste of time"
5,"Lower wattage which work for me. It is light weight and I read reviews about it sliding when you push the button ( I prefer handle open, but price and all) anyway this will be a problem on a slick counter however a cheap silicon mat will solve this perfectly.I love the look and size. I have purchased several  black and decker small Kitchen appliances and have been happy with them, although as a wood worker always avoided there tools, I have found these to be great, affordable and stylish."
5,"This is a solid high quality microwave that is perfect for the counter top.  It's quiet, easy to use, easy to clean and everything I was looking for in a microwave."
1,"We figured this might not last long since it was a smaller, mid range priced microwave, but super disappointed that after only 7 months it started to spark and smoke up! I was only reheating something for 30s and thankfully was right by the microwave, so I was able to stop/unplug it before it caught fire. The smoke was so bad (I thought the sound at first was just the food re-heating). The food itself was not the issue, but I didn’t eat it anyway.What’s even worse is the link to their product support page leads to a 404 Error message, and when searching for microwave, there are 0 results. We’re obviously well past our return window, so this is just a warning that your microwave may short circuit at some point and potentially cause a fire."
1,I loved this thing while it lasted but now the thing starts running when I open the door. I see A LOT of people are having this same problem. Doesn't seem safe to me. This was a lot of money for me too.
2,Loved this microwave. Was the perfect size. It worked great for about 18 months and then stopped heating. Very disappointed it didn’t last longer. Will look for a more reliable one and won’t buy this brand again.
1,This Panasonic microwave works fine but I noticed that there was often an electrical zap when I plugged it in.  I also noticed that the cord was warm when I ran it for a couple of minutes or more.  I happened to mention this to a friend with electrical experience who brought testing equipment the next time he came to see me.  When in operation the unit tested at around 16.5 amps and 1880 watts.  My friend said this was a fire hazard and advised me to stop using it.  Therefore I will be returning it.
2,The unit is noisy!!  It sounds like it is vibrating apart inside. I would not buy again.
5,Perfect fit in my small apartment. It warms the food really good. It takes a little long. But other than that I love it.
4,SO FAR I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS. IT WOULD BE NICE THOUGH IF THE CONTROL PAD LIT UP SO YOU CAN SEE IT BETTER AT NIGHT.
5,With very limited counter space this was my only option. I do a lot of baking so I can’t sacrifice space.It gets the job done. Only issue is size.A large dinner plate will just barely fit.Standard popcorn bags are too large. It rubs against the sides and burn that cardboard thingy in side the oven.Use the mini popcorn bags usually call 100cal snack packs.Also it doesn’t heat the food as quickly as my previous oven did.
4,works just fine so far. It's a little under powered and the turn table and rotating mechanism seem a bit weak.
3,Unit overheats and will therefore not last as expected. The earlier unit of same model number lasted six years and did NOT overheat. There IS NO AIR FLOW from the LEFT SIDE although the grills are still there.There is MINIMAL AIR FLOW FROM THE REAR. This unit will burn out after the one year warranty but long before its expected 10-year lifetime.You should state that MODEL JES 1072 is ONLY for reheating items at low temperature.This is the most important feature of a microwave.
5,I like the look but not the price of what I thought I was purchasing. It heats well as a microwave but as an air fryer it doesn’t. My ninja foodie airfrys better. So I would have ordered for less the same brand for just the microwave part but not the airfryer part and come out cheaper.
5,It does a good job on food. Absolutely recommended.
1,"Pull it out of the box, plug it in, put popcorn in, push popcorn button- nothing happens.  get out manual ""with mw in waiting state"" absolutely no description of what that is.  Buttons seem difficult to push, because they're too small and also because the letters on the cover do not match up with where the buttons actually are.  Seems you have to adjust power lever on every single use.  After a few attempts, and after following directions explicitly, hitting the start button adds 30 seconds to cook time.  After pushing many buttons, if you don't start it immediately, it will reset and you get to start all over again.  Called customer service.  The little girl in the third world country was as confused as I am, ""that shouldn't happen""...  Most likely will return it and get my money back."
4,"Great for small spaces! Hardly takes up any room. However with that being said the power is significantly decreased--but when you look at the stats on the microwave it indicates that. We had a regular microwave it broke I decided to get this smaller one, however it took so long to heat things up my husband went to the store and bought another one. So this one now sits in the closest but it will be great for a back up."
5,"Such a great microwave for small spaces, gets the job done! Just what I was looking for. Not too small, but also not too big."
5,"Great microwave for the price. The air fryer option is awesome! This was installed in our new home, and one of our builders immediately bought one for himself."
5,There was nothing i dislike.
5,Brought this for my elderly mother and she loves it. It fit under her upper cabnets perfectly and she loves the performance. She is very happy with it.
2,It was too little for my needs.
2,plastic covering the buttons wore out after 2 months.
2,The tray doesn't  stay seated.  A lot of moisture  collects  in side.  Steam escapes throu door .
3,"I thought the microwave was going to be bigger. It's basically a a small dorm or little apt size one. And I'm very disappointed that it did not have the ""mirror"" finish front as the description stated. Overall, it's fine"
1,"Press ""1"" and the set time change and in addition to other weird things happening when the buttons are pushed.  I would not buy this product ever again.I noticed that they don't ask to give stars for Quality.  so I had to give zero stars on all"
1,"Hello,We purchased this microwave in May of 2022, it worked fine until we used the ""broil"" feature this weekend. About 1 minute into ""broiling"" it started to smoke, then there was a pop and the entire ceiling of the microwave burst into flames. Luckily, I was close by hear, pull out the food/tray, unplug and take it to the back porch where it continued to make sizzle noises for about 10 minutes. Unfortunately, it is past the 1 year warranty, but it would be great if GE would refund the cost of this product for us!"
2,I really liked this microwave up until I had to have someone replace the fuse within the microwave itself. It worked fine for about 6 weeks after replacing the fuse before it did it again. And of course it didn’t happen until my warranty expired.
1,"Very disappointed in this microwave.  When running, it makes a loud vibration humming sound.  I have never owned a microwave or used a microwave that makes such a loud noise.  The defrost does not work as it should.  Returning this product, I do NOT recommend."
4,Smaller than it seems
4,Quickly warmup. Little noise.If you do want your food was fast to served then this is a perfect one.
5,So cute and works well in small places. I really recommend
4,I like the microwave although it took getting used to as controls are a bit sensitive to touch .It is a very nice color. I bought rubber feet for it so it wouldn't move on the counter. I don't like it as well as my previous microwave but it does the job.
5,"I bought this for my office and it does the job perfectly. It's small enough and it is really nice looking, with a stainless steel-type finish. Only thing that some people may not like is that the door is mirrored. some people like to keep an eye on their food while cooking to make sure it doesnt overflow or explode. I use the mirrored door to reapply my lipstick, so it all works out in the end."
1,Bought it thinking its a good brand but it doesn't work properly.  I am always afraid of fire when using it as vapor comes out from inside while heating the food.
1,"The interior dimension was t almost 2 inches shorter in width than they listed and as a result it only has about 1.0 cu ft capacity not the 1.2 cu ft as listed. That extra 2 inches of width which my current microwave had would make it a lot easier to grasp and lift large bowls or the platter in and out of the microwave. Inaccurate information wastes a lot of people's time having to send back an order and look for a replacement and I won't buy panasonic again since i feel they are not trustworthy with the accuracy of their information. Its already hard enough to not be able to see a product firsthand and have to guess at what it really looks like in size or features, so in the very least they should have accurate dimensions."
1,"Had it for less than a month. Not powerful at all, the glass plate kept shifting regardless of how often it got fixed, it rattled somehow - not very stable and no 30 second button (a big deal for those that are used to it). Didn't have the time for a return pick up so still looking for a microwave. This is one went straight to the thrash."
4,"For small spaces, perfect for dinner plate size."
3,"Only one thing prevented me from giving this nuking machine a five star rating. It has metal feet which cause it to slide every time you open the door or push a button! Not too swift if you have a Formica or Granite counter top or any smooth surface for your kitchen counters! There are a couple of cures for this brain fade on the part of the engineering team that designed it. [1] Place the machine on a rubber dish mat or [2] Order ""Slipstick GorillaPads CB147 Non Slip Furniture Pads/Gripper Feet (Set of 16) Self Adhesive Rubber Floor Protectors, 1 inch Round"" from Amazon or go to a hardware store or discount home center and get some self-stick anti-slide rubber pads around an inch to an inch and a half, cut them in half and make a semi-circle hole in the middle to go around the small feet on the unit and stick them on. Depending on the thickness of the pad, you may have to apply a second one on top the first. Outside of that, it does a great job or microwaving your food and it easy to use if you read the instruction book first. One more thing, it's not the greatest of instruction manuals. Know that you have to enter the clock time during your initial setup by entering four digits for time. For example 1:15 should be entered as 0115. They don't tell you that!  While entering the cooking time, entering the left zero isn't necessary. Farberware are you listening? You can't put feet that slide on a smooth surface on a microwave!"
1,Trying to cook a baked potatoes the unit over heated after about 5 minutes. The power cut off and tripped the breaker on my breaker panel. GE dosen't repair because they don't make replacement parts
5,I bought this for my classroom to heat up lunches after the older microwave started melting on the inside. It is a great microwave.
5,"This 1200W microwave from Panasonic heats quite a bit faster than our older 900W Sharp model, which died. That's to be expected given the higher power output, but nice nonetheless. It also uses counter space more efficiently. The oven cavity is about a third larger in volume than the 900W model, but the Panasonic has about the same outer dimensions. It's about an inch wider and higher, and about an inch less in depth.The controls are a bit simpler as well: there are fewer button pushes to start heating. It has lots of cooking features, but our primary use is for heating refrigerated items (leftovers, etc).Our old Sharp was very inexpensive and lasted four years. We paid up for this Panasonic model, so we'll see if it outlasts that. But on the basis of power, counter footprint and features we are happy."
2,"My parents have a microwave that is more than 30 years old and still functions perfectly.This piece of junk lasted 2 years. I'm giving it a rating of 2 stars for 2 years of annoyance but some functionality.The details:Pros: -It has a silence function so there are no beeping noises when the kids are asleep.-It's small, but still fits our dinner plates.Cons!!! -The paint used on the top inner part of the microwave is so bad that there are chips and rust spreading everywhere! There is a full rusted crack in the seam of where the door meets the body.-It doesn't have much power so it takes forever to warm up food.-It is super difficult to clean any food that splattered because of the cheap paint and parts."
4,"I am a bit prejudice because the Panasonic Genius microwave that we are replacing lasted 37 years. If this one does the same (I don't expect it to.) it will out live me.I spent a lot of time reading about other manufacturer's models. All have their pros and cons, as does this one. We have used this one for one month and find that it does everything that we need it to do.There are more options on this microwave than we will ever use. However, we soon learned the basics that we use every day. Don't be intimidated by all of the bells and whistles.I wish that the 13.4"" turntable was a little larger. Our old one was 15"".The weight of the microwave is only 25.50 pounds. It is annoying that the right side moves back on the counter from the pressure of opening the door.All said, I would purchase this model again."
5,"This is a very attractive little microwave, perfect for small spaces. It has a number of features, but my favorite is the Mute Button, allowing you to turn off all beeps. I LOVE this!  Unnecessary beeping has always irritated me and until we had to replace our old microwave recently I never knew beep-less microwaves were a thing. I'll never go back now! The overall design of this microwave is elegant, (especially in black), and the recessed handle is great for minimal counter space. The operation is quiet and you certainly can't beat the price. Make sure you order the model with the Mute Button, though. All Comfee models do NOT have that awesome feature!"
2,"THIS IS AN UPDATE FOR THE BELOW: I have had the microwave for less than a year and the timer went out. NOT pleased. Toshiba used to be top end. THIS IS THE ORIGINAL REVIEW: I cannot give you any information about longevity because I just plugged it in and used it twice. It is lower wattage than my last microwave, so, obviously, it heats a little slower. That is fine. This one is a third smaller and that is great for a small kitchen. It is very quiet when it runs. I have seen people rave about it because you can turn off the timer beep. I don’t want that option. I need to hear it! I leave it on.  It does fit a full sized dinner plate and the inside light is BRIGHT! All in all, I like it. My last microwave lasted ten years. We’ll see how this one does."
5,Beautiful product. Seems like good quality
4,"This fulfilled our need for a microwave oven that fit inside a cabinet. We remodeled our kitchen and wanted the microwave off the counter. Our cabinet is 13.5 inches deep.  Most appliances we looked at were either too large for the space or grossly lacked features. This is a nice combination of size and features. We mostly use a microwave oven for defrosting, reheating, and melting butter.  Our former oven was 1100 watts compared to this 700 watts.  So, it is slower than our former oven. It does accomodate a10.5 inch dinner plate, large coffee mugs, and an 8 cup / 2 quart Pyrex batter bowl.Pros:Small footprintNice array of featuresAttractive exteriorPre-programs for popcorn, potatoes, and beveragesLarge interior (adequate for a round 2 quart casserole dish)Cons:Moderate power levelLimited interior space (no big turkeys)Less accurate automatic defrosting than our full size 1100 watt Panasonic microwaveConclusion: This is a nice product satisfying our requirement for a small footprint without compromising too much in features."
1,"I bought this microwave exactly four months ago. About 3 weeks ago, after being used, a continued beep  sounded until I disconnected it. I never thought it was something to worry about until a couple of days ago. Suddenly, we had a smoke odor that alerted us. My husband and I went around the house checking and found nothing. Today I used the microwave to reheat some food and I kept nearby. It seemed to function normally, but I started to feel the smoke odor again, I looked at it and  black smoke had filled the microwave and was coming out of it, we had to open all windows and doors. I did not keep the box, I never imagined a Farbweware microwave oven could be disposable and a fire hazard. Terribly disappointed! It was a complete waste of our money."
2,"Pretty much from the beginning, this would overheat and shut itself off or just half stop working if asked to heat food for more than three minutes.  It has room on all sides for ventilation, and I'm just talking about heating up TV dinner sorts of things.  After 18 months, when you plug it in, even without turning it on or putting it into cook mode, it gets super hot and smells like burning plastic.  Two stars because when it was wasn't overheating, it did manage to microwave food for a while."
3,Hhhmmm...bought this for my sister in February. Now it doesn’t work. Will call to see if something can be done. It’s not expensive but wasn’t expecting a fail this soon.
1,"Not even a month old and the Keypad bubble clearcoat is forming bubbles under it and growing quickly. It looks like it will reach an edge soon and then start to peel. At which I can only assume that it will become unusable. My last countertop microwave oven last almost a year before having serious problems and I had to finally replace it just last month. Now the new one, at twice the cost, is taking a #$%^ in a month. When this one finally dies in short order I will NOT be buying another microwave. I'm done with them. They are all junk."
1,"Nothing, it’s vary poor quality, I really want to  return it . Well it ask me to rating I mark a star but if was up to me it will be no star at all ."
5,It works for my purpose. Love the gray interior.
5,It's definitely huge! To my surprise it wasn't complicated to use and it's extremely powerful.
5,Ought this because lost husband due to cancer.  Don’t really need to use stove/oven because too big.  This purchase makes it easier to cook in and doesn’t heat up whole house.  Glad I bought it.  Would recommend to someone who is single.
3,"Overall, it's a space saver. The stainless trim looks nice. - Otherwise, it's nearly identical to the one I had for 10-years before it just gave up. I DON'T EXPECT THIS ONE TO LAST THIS LONG. And I sure don't know how it became an ""Amazon Pick."" Why?It has one or two very defective features and one negative. Importantly, if one presses the ""OPEN"" door tab just a little to the right, THE MICROWAVE TURNS ON, with the door opening!! Scary! One must REMEMBER to press the open tab/button to the left, or else!It's a bit noisy in its rotation. This pretty much means something mechanical is not centered. In machinery, noise always equals eventual breakdown!And my personal peeve is that my last, old microwave had a means to set ""SECONDS,"" not just minutes. This does not, only minutes and a half minute. So you can't simply WARM a taco, for instance. You have to HEAT it!If there was an option to give it a 2.5 stars rating, I would. My 3-star rating is generous."
5,Easy to see screen with semi quite door.  Timer has a nice sound for ready notification. I won't bother to mention the Inside quality and easy cleanupSetting well lit for anytime use
1,"I bought it because it was GE; however, it did not last long beyond the warranty period; betrayed by GE; never buying GE again."
5,"Largest size I found, perfect for all my large casserole dishes.  Works great and is fast.  I miss my old microwave that had express defrost and defrost for common items like butter, cream cheese and ice cream.  The plus timer is worthless as it only works once the microwave has stopped.  You cannot add time to a item that is already cooking.  This does not help at all when you are trying to make popcorn.  No easy set buttons like a 30 sec button.  Good value for the money, wouldn't buy this microwave if there were any other  choices available when I purchased this one.  If you just use to warm up items this works just fine."
1,"I removed my old Magic Chef microwave which always worked reliably, but the door opening button stuck a little bit on one side (after 10 years of daily use!). I plugged this new product into the same outlet and the power came on, I set the clock and tried to heat up a bowl of soup. The turntable turned and it made noise (more than my other one) and seemed to be working but after 30 minutes of trying and reading through the manual, I gave up. My soup was still cold. I plugged in my Magic Chef and was happily slurping my soup in about 90 seconds. Bummer but the manufacturing must not be as good as Amazon thinks because this is now wasting more resources to be returned. I guess I will stick with my good old Magic Chef!"
5,"Chefman products are great. I have several of their small appliances and I’ve found them to be reliable and of high quality. This microwave is no different. It is of the same quality you’d expect from any of the top brands and it works perfectly. It has lots of preset modes for easy use. One thing that keeps me coming back to Chefman products is their excellent customer service and warranty. They back their products and will provide you with great service if you have any problems. If you’re considering a countertop microwave, this is the one to purchase."
1,I ordered this microwave because Amazon recommended it. The control panel buttons didn't work.  I even had a friend come over to try. It just didn't work. I was hard for me to carry it to UPS to return. Very disappointed.
2,"The media could not be loaded.When the little ring base is on, it makes the plate too high to reach the center brown piece so it can rotate. Therefore it doesn’t rotate. The little brown center piece seems too short. My other microwave (different brand) has the same part but taller and that plate does rotate."
1,"The moment we plugged it in, it smelt like electrical burning. I even unplugged and tried several times. Something was clearly wrong with it. I bought this for my sons apartment, I had to return it,  couldn’t risk a fire!!"
4,"The oven is great. I would give it 5 stars , but the instructions are very incomplete.  The oven has programmable functions that are not described anywhere either in the owners manual or online.  For example if I want to do a ""sensor defrost""  how do IO set the oven.  I tried this and the results weren't pretty.  So - a great oven, but no help for use of advanced features."
5,"Using the power of light, this machine causes all the water molecules in your food to dance. I would highly recommend it to any fans of hot pockets, pizza rolls, breakfast burritos, or anybody who hates cooking as much as I do."
1,"I'm old.  My family bought our first microwave in 1976.  Yes, way back in 1976.  That oven was better than this one.I've owned this for a little over a month.  The first week it just decided to stop in the middle of a 30 second heat-up.  Weird. Ok, whatever.  A few days later, same thing.  The following week it just displayed a ""5"" and wouldn't do anything.  Last week I requested a replacement.  I mean, weird things happen, right?I just hooked up its replacement.  The ""go"" button doesn't work.  The quick cook (1-6) buttons don't work.As soon as I hit send I'll be shopping for a replacement oven so I can have a box to ship this piece of crap back in."
1,"I haven't even plugged it in yet, but this product deserves to be panned because the images, which I presume were supplied by the manufacturer, are a lie.  I don't know what they might claim to me be measuring, but the actual interior dimensions, measured at the door, are 10 7/8 inch wide, 8 inches high, and 10 inches deep.  The image in the product description shows the interior larger in all three dimensions.  My dinner plates only just fit in - had it been any smaller and they did not, I would have been VERY annoyed at having to repack it and send it back.  There is no excuse for the lie."
5,I like it's appearance and also the light that lights up the inside in the oven. It's very bright and you can see your food very well when you're it's cooking.
1,Touch pad did not process the items input. Returned.
5,"My old Panasonic microwave that I bought in 1998 was rusting inside and so I thought it was time to be replaced. I was worried b/c I had an under counter nook that was built to house my old microwave and I thought I would have trouble finding a replacement of the same size. (It baffles me why so many manufacturers change the dimensions of their products over time....making it a huge headache if you have a ""custom kitchen"" and an appliance breaks). Anyway this microwave was the perfect size and works much like the old one. Was very pleased."
1,"There is a little plastic overhang rectangle on the top, in the front-left corner that rises OVER the top of the microwave. As you can see from the photos, the wooden cabinet pushes it down and gets scraped up every time I open the cabinet. A significant design flaw in my opinion."
2,"bought this in April, 2 days ago will not heat food up. Everything else is working. I should have looked at the return policy closer, I have to pay to ship it back and include 7$ money order for insurance. I got what I paid for............"
3,Bought for my son’s small kitchen space when my husband had to go live with him and cook for him after he lost the use of his right arm & hand and left arm in an accident and had so many other additional injuries that time to spend on cooking would be in short supply. It was the right size to fit in that small counter space but they had difficulty getting things to cook to hot enough to eat in a reasonable amount of time. So it didn’t really help as much as we were hoping. Now that my son only needs the bone grafts to heal in his arm abd then physical therapy and is otherwise functioning mostly on his own except driving he’s still not finding the microwave very practical.
3,Wheel inside broken : (
5,"Lo compre para mi madre, le encantó el color, calidad y para mi el precio"
1,"Like its physical appearance, wished its interior was all white.  However, absolutely dissatisfied with the moaning and groaning sound it has started to make over the last 4 weeks or so. Have no idea why and would appreciate anyone who has bought one of these to say if they've experienced the same moaning/groaning I'm experiencing."
3,"The loudest microwave I have ever used. Not sure if it is due to the shipping - the box was broken, although there is no obvious damage inside. Can't trust this brand of microwave anymore."
4,It’s not as powerful as my old one. My mistake. The Wi-Fi isn’t a great addition.
3,"Met expectations, however, decals for the buttons were printed in French."
3,"The unit will heat up food. However, if you reduce the power on any level, it really doesn’t do a whole lot of anything. For instance, if you cook something on regular power for two minutes, it’ll be blazing hot. However, if you reduce it to half heat over four minutes, it’ll still be cold. I’ve tried to see if experiment even reducing it to maybe seven or eight power level. So I’m saying with my unit is that if you leave it all in all the time you’re gonna be happy. Anything else and you’ll be sadly disappointed  And take five times as long to get the same result. If you don’t go full power all the time."
2,"I've had the Comfee for a while now and I wanted to update my review.The inadequate vent fan mentioned in my initial review has become a true annoyance. Condensed moisture coats the interior of the oven after every use, and the trough onder the rotating glass plate fills with fluid that must be mopped away daily. Odors also linger in the oven to a much greater extent than other small microwaves I have owned.I've removed a star from my initial 3-star review -- you can do better than this oven.---------------Small footprint and an easy to understand interface. I really like the ability to turn off all sound prompts. Problems: the vent fan isn't up to keeping moisture from building up in the cooking chamber, and visibility thru the window is poor. Also, although rated at 700 watts the cooking times are longer than other ovens with the same power rating.  For the price it's an adequate product."
4,"What you can't see in the pictures is that there is a LOT of room inside... the left and back walls recede to allow bigger dishes to fit.  Also the inside is grey not white.  It is a large unit, but fits on my counter nicely - shown next to the stove for reference.  Cooks exactly as expected, and have had no problems with it so far.  The only reason I took off a star is that is seems a bit too loud for my liking."
5,I have been using inverter ovens for a while. Works better than most microwave ovens.
5,Mostly to microwave but have used the air frier.
5,I love this microwave.  It heats the food perfectly.  Can't find any complaint. Thank you 😊
3,Had a broken turn wheel
4,Fit the space I needed. Very quiet.
1,"After 7 months it makes this horrible grinding noise and sounds like it is going to explode. It's so disappointing. My mother is on a fixed income and thought this would be a good microwave. Nope, its a piece of junk!"
3,It does ok. Just was use to a bigger model
1,"We bought this unit based on a known brand and good reviews. The unit failed exactly one year and 6 days from purchase. That was 6 days past the warranty. When I contacted Toshiba, their rep was unsympathetic and said she couldn't do anything. I wrote the customer support and after a pretty long wait finally heard back from another rep who said they would issue a refund check. However after weeks of waiting and numerous attempts to reach them about the refund check, we have heard nothing and gotten nothing. So the unit failed within a year of purchase. Customer reps were unhelpful and did not follow through with what was promised. Toshiba is not what it once was. The new company that took over that brand name is delivering crappy quality and does not stand behind their products. Stay away from anything Toshiba. Very disappointing."
3,Too loud but does it’s job.
5,We have one of these at work that gets a lot of use.Expect a long life from this one with the lighter use in the home.
5,"Have only had this for a few weeks. Primarily I use to heat up food or liquids. Easy to take out of the box and lift on to the counter. So far heats my foods well, not noisy and I like it"
5,"I have a small apartment in the city and this was just what I needed. Fits great on a countertop sitting below a cabinet but still leaves a little room in front of it. A standard full size plate just barely fits inside so it's great for reheating leftovers. I also use it for heating chai tea lattes and popcorn and it works great.I like the ""quick"" buttons that just let you push a number for that many minutes and it starts immediately. I also use the ""add 30 seconds"" button a lot. For instance if I want 1 minute 30 seconds I just push the Add 30 Seconds button 3 times and am done.I wasn't really concerned about the looks but the unit looks very nice in any kitchen, especially for the price."
4,Works good but the smell hasn't dissipated for two weeks. Had a electronic burning smell.
5,"I ordered this Toshiba medium-size countertop microwave for my mother-in-law who, at the age of 90, is nearly blind, now.  The reviews were mostly very positive, and many of the features seemed good for someone with limited sight.First of all, the interior is white - not dark gray, like some.  The bright LED lighting makes seeing the interior far easier that way.  Besides that, the start and stop buttons are bold, colored rectangles.  The start rectangle is white, and the stop rectangle is red.  They visually stand out.Also important for someone with limited sight, is sound.  Whenever a button is pressed, there's a loud beep to confirm the selection was made.  For those who don't want beeps, the sound can be turned off by holding the sound button for a few seconds, or back on with another long press.When sight is limited, having a nice, large door handle is much easier to operate than a small push-button type of door release.  I also believe that a door handle is more long-term reliable and durable than the push-button-type.  I've had more than one microwave push-button door release fail.  The digital display is very bright, which is another bonus for the vision-impaired.I was really impressed by the very low noise level.  After a couple seconds, the magnetron quiets down and is super-quiet throughout the cooking process.  The numbers 1 thru 6 can be pressed for quick minute settings.  For example, if I press the number 3, the microwave begins a 3 minute run.  But, if I first press ""Time Cook"", then the numbers can be used to set a very specific time that you may need, like 3 minutes and 45 seconds, etc.  If you first press the Start button, it begins an automatic 30 second run for every press of that button, so 3 presses equals 1-1/2 minutes, etc.My only real complaint for people with limited sight, is that the turntable doesn't make one full revolution for every 10 seconds, as microwaves always seemed to do back in the day.  So, if my mother-in-law were to set the time for 1-1/2 minutes to heat a cup of coffee, there's no telling exactly where the cup handle will be facing.  She will have to carefully feel the cup and turn it to grab the handle.  Though I can see quite well, even I would like it the old way @ 10 seconds per revolution.By the way, I set the time for 90 seconds to test-heat a cup of cold water, to compare it to my much larger and more powerful LG microwave.  Mine is rated at 1200 watts, while this smaller Toshiba is rated at 900 watts.  The water was very, very close to the hot temperature I'm used to!  Impressive.  So, this oven should be no slouch when cooking veggies, stuffed green peppers, potatoes, etc.Whether your sight is perfect or very limited, this excellent Toshiba microwave oven should serve you well.  I'll update this review in the future to report the good or the bad, as it's used daily in the coming weeks and months."
5,"I got this microwave for my nephew who just went to college. He has it in his new apartment and he was so grateful when I gave it to him. He tells me it is fast, powerful and it works exactly as it should. Microwaves are a necessary appliance for a kitchen these days as so many foods can be cooked or heated up in a microwave, so this is a no brainer. 5 stars."
4,I bought this to replace a like sized microwave that finally died after 20 years. Size is perfect for the space and the stainless steel details look nice.  Powerful enough to cook bacon in a couple of minutes yet quiet. The glides aren’t adjustable so I needed to use a little shim to make the appliance level so it wouldn’t slide when I push the button to open it and you need to type in a zero before setting the timer if it’s for less than 10 minutes but other than those annoyances it’s been great. Hoping that it lasts as long as the one it replaced.
5,"I needed a microwave for the office and this worked great. Especially when considering the price the value is amazing. It works great, and has a lot of options that I've never used.  Some smaller microwaves seem underpowered and take forever to heat food, this isn't one of those.  Highly recommended, great value."
5,Great buy
5,Love this
5,Had a 1000 watt microwave before but it failed. This 700w takes up less space and I like it better when heating up food. The larger microwave seemed to over heat things. This one takes a little longer but seems to not overheat (dry out) the food. I do not eat tv dinners so this may not be the best review if you are heating/cooking those types of frozen meals.
2,"The media could not be loaded.Researched all the best microwaves and finally decided on this one.  Part of the reason for selecting this microwave was because of its alleged quietness.  It is the loudest appliance in my kitchen.  Since the first time I used this microwave the unit has been rattling, vibrating, and cling-clanging for the duration of each use.  I would prefer not to have to return it but I am approaching the end of my 30-day return window and I don't want to be stuck with the noisiest microwave I've ever owned."
4,To reheat foods
3,"Beware if you have asthma or sensitive lungs. I have never had a microwave that has put out such a strong chemical smell. I was very surprised when I smelled that chemical smell come out of  it while it was cooking. I figured I would give it a chance and that maybe over a few days that stench would go away. After 5 or 6 days, it was still there. I don't think that inhaling that stench could possible be good for my lungs.Otherwise, the item arrived on time, packaged well. Worked fine unless you don't mind inhaling a toxin.Why in heck can't we make things in America."
1,"This is the worst appliance I've ever owned.  If I heat something for 30 or 60 seconds (cause, there's not a button specifically for that) when I take the food out and close the door it starts back up again for an undetermined amount of time (usually about 5 minutes).  Nothing stops this thing from running, not the cancel button, not even unplugging it from the wall, you do that and it starts back up as soon as its plugged back in.  Don't waste your money."
4,"I downsized from a big clunky microwave that was black and steel.This one is smaller but it gives me more counter space , does the same job . looks really cute in white!I like it."
1,The media could not be loaded.The fan inside the microwave for the airfryer and oven function was rubbing against something and extremely noisy!! This is a bad one brand new out of the box!
3,"The microwave itself is fine. The problem is that the feet are cheap, plastic garbage that break so easily."
5,Purchased as a temporary replacement during a kitchen remodel. Worked great and has decent power for size and price.
4,"Update - 2020-01-08 [2 years, 8 months after purchase]So today I experienced my first problem with the microwave - one that makes it somewhat unusable: many of the buttons no longer work, especially the STOP button. So now after each time something's cooking, it's necessary either to pull the plug out and plug it in again, or add time in increments, and manually count down, pulling open the door to finish cooking. I opened up the case (requires special star screwdriver heads), and pulled out the keypad panel connector to attempt to tighten the connector flat cable to the circuit board, but it didn't fix the problem. The flat cable connector to the keypad is under the glue-fastened front stainless steel panel, so even if I did get it off, the microwave would look horrible after repair. Time for a new microwave. Star rating reduced to 4 - I'd expected at least 5 years, but it was good while it worked.Update -  2019-09-15I was just using the microwave this morning, and again wanted to do an update on how good this microwave is. I haven't had a single problem with it; it does what I need it to. I love being able to interrupt cooking by just pulling open the door. It's very reliable._______[Original Review]We bought this back in May 2017. I didn't write a review back when it was delivered because I'd rather use it for a while, then assess. This morning, I was just reflecting on how happy I am with this microwave.When I bought, I was looking for an economical, 1000W microwave with a simple interface, and a door that could be opened with a handle at any time, including when the microwave is cooking. This microwave does just that, and it looks good too. Some features I like:-- I can open the door with the handle at any time just by pulling on the handle (no need to press some button to make it open). And the microwave doesn't slide across (forward) the bench when I pull the door - the tension of the latch is just right.- Cooking quality is good (haven't done any tests about evenness of cooking, but the plate in the microwave does rotate, unlike some microwaves that don't have this feature).- Pressing START without any other input starts cooking for 30sec- there are quick start buttons 1 through 6 that just start cooking for that number of minutes when pressed- pressing the STOP button stops cooking. Pressing again clears any remaining time. Pressing again turns off the display (e.g. if one doesn't like the bright light of the display at night).So far, I'd recommend this, it's a nice microwave. Thanks to all the others who reviewed this beforehand and helped me make an informed decision before I bought it."
1,"This is a nice-looking microwave. But that's about it's only good feature.I noticed when I received it that the touch panel was slightly bubbled -- and although it didn't seem to affect the performance, I was afraid that it might in the future. So, I ordered a replacement and it had the exact same problem. After cooking anything, excessive, dripping condensation forms inside the microwave-- and it doesn't dry. The door and turntable were literally dripping wet all the time. Other reviewers have noted the same about this and other Black & Decker microwaves. And within 2 weeks, the power seemed to drop by half. I unfortunately had to return it."
5,Love it.  A perfect small size that we needed in a special place in the house.  Works great.
4,"I would rate this microwave as five star.  It has worked without a fault, the controls are easy to use and I find no fault with at all."
3,"First, I wouldn't trade this throwback to the 70's for three times its price. I find it absurd and not a little obscene to charge consumers for silence. The scenario of working- or poor people getting the noisiest, beeping-est, microwave, because that's all they can afford, having their sleep disturbed in close quarters, is SOO offensive. It's like paying more for foods with less sodium.For as much as I LOVE this microwave for the d*mn silence, I'm writing a review after a month-and-a-half ownership to warn people that the turntable is extremely unstable. This is the matter of bewilderment, because the turntable isn't lightweight. It goes off track so easily, and I worry that if I don't keep a very close eye on it while it begins heating whatever's inside, the turntable might remain stable.I would buy this again, no question, but for people disabled with motor-related disabilities, and definitely for households with children allowed to use the microwave, I'm writing this review to call your attention to this deficit. It is a deficit. I have a loud, 5-beep, cheap, 700-watt Hamilton Beach microwave whose turntable goes off-track only if I pull it. I have never owned a microwave where the turntable is as easily dislodged as it is with this Toshiba.So buy it, but beware."
5,"Even at .30secs the power of this microwave is incredible; and not to mention it's quit beautiful and elegant (as far as kitchen appliances go😍)This is a large, beautiful,  and Durable product!I'd highly recommend😉"
3,"It does everything well except the rotation timing is off. When I put in a cup of coffee handle sticking forward after one or two minutes the handle sticks backwards. Having a hard time getting it out without burning myself. My previous microwave did full rotations. So if you enter a cup off coffee handle sticking forward at the end of 30 seconds, one minute, two minutes, etc. when the microwave stops the handle is still sticking forward. Easy in an easy out."
1,"This microwave has become a record setter in our home. It can heat up a cup of water in about 5 minutes, plus 2 more. Wanna defrost a 1½pound pack of burger you forgot to thaw for dinner tonight? 45 minutes later, it's thawed! Want the time displayed on the clock? Too bad! It only works as a timer! We have grown accustomed to doubling all heat times. (It's been a disappointing purchase for sure!)"
2,This is an overpriced microwave!  If this is an air fryer or convection oven it is defective.  But which is it?  It is sold with the description of an air fryer but the manual says its a convection oven ~ and the control buttons have a button for both.  It took 55+ minutes to air fry/ convection oven some chicken wings at 425* which normally take a real air fryer 25 minutes to cook and brown nicely.  Even at 55 minutes they were not browned at all ~ they were still slimy.  And this unit gets REALLY hot on the outside/inside when you're using it as an oven/air fryer.Save your money and buy an actual air fryer.  This works great as a microwave but its overpriced for just being that.
3,Its not dead all the way. Its just acting erratically as in always on to some degree (we hear something running). We unplug it when not using it now as we are afraid of it starting a fire. It was great for about 3 years.
2,"Don't believe the hype - centers still hot, large dishes still uneven temp, popcorn setting way off for all size bags.... As in you better not walk away or you will have a fire, i wish i would have taken a picture of the flaming popcorn bag. 2 stars, second star purely for the size of microwave, other than that do not spend the extra money here unless that is what you want."
4,We have had for less than 2 months and the plastic film over the numbers has bubbled
3,I really wish I would have returned this as soon as I tested it and it only got to 400 degrees (not 425) and doesn't brown or toast any foods. The microwave is okay but it really gets dangerously hot on the outside and has a huge countertop footprint. The worst part is that it is very hard to clean the metal interior and it doesn't broil. I'm holding onto my old toaster oven (that this could have replaced) because it can broil a steak quickly and gets to 450 degrees whereas this oven just makes a mess on the interior and doesn't brown. Even my home made pizza takes twice the time to cook and it is barely crisp. I've tried all of the fancy controls such as sensor cook for frozen vegetables and sometimes it works but most times it's either still cold or flaming hot. Worst of all is that the interior is extremely hard to clean after convection cooking. Even the outside gets smeary and looks messy easily. And I really like a clean kitchen. I was really looking forward to finally getting a new microwave and this has been a real disappointment.
3,"The Farberware microwave is OK for most basic uses.  Plenty of volume. OK appearance of machine. Instructions for use OK if rather skimpy.  The cooking levels sometime do not work, i.e. for frozen dinners do not cook the item thoroughly but instead leave food still cold in part of tray so that there is a need to add minutes to time.  Maybe I just didn't understand the instructions?  It would help if the selection button keypad was better lit, too dark when using in a dark kitchen."
4,All features are functioning and it cooks ok.  I would like it better if it were larger.Delivery was terrible it bounced around in California for a week before heading to me in Virginia which took another week.
1,"I purchased this two years ago. It’s now throwing an error code and won’t function. I see there are some ways to fix this, but I’m annoyed, because this was more costly than most of the microwaves I could have chosen. I have never seen a microwave break down so fast. I don’t feel I should have to pay a repair man to fix what shouldn’t be broken. If I had purchased a lesser cost microwave I’m confident I wouldn’t have this issue. Also, I got this because it was a higher wattage than most, but it does not cook noticeably faster than any other microwave I’ve used of lesser wattage.Might try to fix it myself, but certainly not dumping any more money into this bad investment."
3,It looks good from a distance and it works. Up close some manufacturing issues are visible. It's a little noisy too.
2,"This unit is ok as a microwave goes but as far as linking it to Alexa , the Msmart app has way to many problems."
4,"The auto locate of the rotating tray is nice as it places it back where it started which reduces spills, but only works if you set the time once and let it run without change to the end of the cycle.Pros and cons on this I think depend on how you actually use a microwave. This one seems geared more to actual cooking than reheating, which is most of what we do with it. For people who actually cook in their microwaves  this is probably a really good, effective bargain priced microwave.  Still playing with the auto-cook/reheat and melt quick select to figure out best way to reheat. So, nothing wrong with it, just isn't the best for how we use it."
2,I bought this Toshiba unit twice.  Each time it stopped working shortly after one year.  After the first failure I bought the Asurion warranty.  I would have expected a longer life since it is only used by my wife and me for reheating and defrosting.
4,Inverter technology is the bomb. Heats food so much better. My only wish is for it to have quick start buttons. Meaning you push #1 and it microwaves for one minute. No more buttons needed. Cheaper microwaves have this option. It should be standard on a higher priced microwave.
2,I liked the design of the microwave but for anything I cook in it it burns it.  Everything gets overcooked.  When I go by the directions of the food I want to cook it always gets overcooked.
2,After one day of owning this I realized it wasn't cooking the food evenly but thought I would just deal with it as the reviews for other microwaves in this size range scared me. But after 4 days of use the lights started blink on and off while cooking and then turn off. Eventually the lights were off 90% of the time so I wrote Amazon and they are sending me a replacement. Hope I have better luck on the next one!
1,"I owned this very make/model for 9 years without problems. I *gave away* the item to a needy friend and purchased a replacement for myself 8 months ago. BIG mistake!The unit purchased from Amazon 4/30/19, delivered on 5/1/19, was perfect until it Wasn't.On or about January 21, 2020 it. JUST. QUIT. Period. Code H-97= no heat, no cook, no way.As of this writing I have spent 4 full days on phone, internet, social media, and with Amazon reps (amazing assistance), all to no avail.I have documented at least a dozen combined ""800"" numbers, web addresses, ""support"" request forms, and message links all leading to NO HELP IN supporting 1-year Warranty with repair or replacement of this item (Retail $168).I am furious with Panasonic USA and hope to complain far and wide using all available modes (Twitter, etc) only AFTER I satisfy my need for a new appliance. First things first. But I have no money to waste on another microwave expense.A Tucker, Georgia, USA, appliance repair person kindly LOANED me a large, working microwave for my personal use.I am a disabled person over age 65 and have limited energy to spare and certainly can't buy a new microwave every 7 months.  So don't buy this particular model, and specifically,  AVOID Panasonic if you foresee needing support!"
4,Just a microwave
3,Great for small spaces but It takes a little longer to get your food hot
4,"Todos,osea facil de usar ,facil de limpiar"
4,Wish I would have got a bigger one this one takes a bit longer to heat stuff up due to the size b. Works great
2,"It worked at first, but then started making a horrible racket whenever I used the convection function. It’s an EXTREMELY loud metallic grinding noise, I’m pretty sure it damaged my hearing. Has to have something to do with the function, because it now takes about twice as long to cook as it used to! I’ve only had it a year and a half. Really wish I’d just gone ahead and gotten a more expensive one.Also the legs are uneven."
5,Bought this microwave for our church kitchen. It's so easy to use and looks great with our other stainless steel appliances.  Easy to clean and works fantastic.
2,This is a perfect microwave for someone stuck in a Tiny House Nation Episode! RV & Camper owners would love this item! Everyone else buy 1000 watts or more.
5,We’ve had no issues with this microwave! It’s a great size and easy to use.
4,I really like this microwave and is my third purchase of this model through the years. I especially like the size because I actually cook in it not just warm up food and coffee like most people do. I gave it a four star rating because when I want to use a lower power rating I have to push the power button several times to get the one I want. My previous one you just had to push the power button and then the number you wanted. Also it was easier to turn off the beeping. This one you have to select to turn it off when you first plug it in which I didn’t know until I read the manual later.
2,Was OK except couldn't see the read out from more than a few inches away.
5,After trying multiple air fryers microwave combos this is by far the best
1,"The microwave broke after one month, I just missed the return window by 1 week. It made maybe 3 bags of popcorn and 4 reheated dinners. I would not recommend buying this microwave unless you enjoy throwing money down the drain."
2,This microwave is so loud - definitely louder then most.
5,This micro/convection oven is quite easy to use.  All controls are easily memorized and/or easily noted on the control pad.  One thing could be improved...a louder tone when the convection oven is up to temperature and ready to receive the food for timed baking.
4,"I bought one of these for my home and one for my office.The one at the office is used 4-6 times per day, the one at home is used maybe 4-6 times per week.The one at the office is still working, but the one at home stopped working over Thanksgiving weekend, thankfully my husband and I were not hosting the holiday.The microwave at home started to make a bubbling/gurgling sound when I used it recently to warm up a small piece of chicken breast on a microwave safe ceramic plate--I didn't think too much about the noise (thinking that the rotating plate in the microwave wasn't sitting in the grooves correctly and there was only 6 or so seconds left on the timer, so I decided to just let it go) until I saw and smelled SMOKE--not steam--but smoke coming out of the microwave. For the record, the rotating plate WAS sitting correctly in the grooves, and after hitting the 30 sec button (aka the start button), my chicken was still as cold as it was when I took it out of the fridge.I'm not sure what happened to my microwave at home, it's always spotless, it doesn't have anything on top of it, and it sits on a counter with nothing else around it (the one at my office is usually piled high with stuff on top of it and the inside has food splatters on it about 70% of the time). I think that I just got unlucky with the one at home.I don't have any bad feelings regarding the microwave, it did what it was supposed to do, unfortunately one of them only worked for 3-1/2 years and the other one is still working--hopefully for a few more years at least!I don't recommend this microwave if you are looking for something small, because it's not small. I'm not re-purchasing this microwave for my home because I really needed a smaller microwave to begin with, I probably will re-purchase it for my office though, when I need to replace the one that I have.That's all."
2,"Beautiful color. Very noisy which I put up with. Sadly did not read the comments about the light bulb. After some months, it started flickering and going out and RIDICULOUSLY you can not replace it! Would not buy again."
5,The media could not be loaded.Goes great with my GE fridge. Fits in small space.
5,Perfectly blends with our newly remodeled kitchen cabinets. Most importantly it functions as expected.
5,"Keypad difficult to see in dim light but we put a small led light above it and that works much better.  Nice to have convection,  microwave and air fryer in one"
5,Bought this as a gift for someone!!!!!
3,Had several months and still can’t figure out how to work the buttons. Instructions are extremely complicated.  May take a loss for a more simple one.???
4,"We purchased this microwave back in July 2020 and up until now, it has been a great microwave!! All the functions worked perfectly, cooked/defrosted foods the way we expected it to come out, and it was easy to use. Unfortunately, it just stopped working a few weeks. No idea why since it was working perfectly fine earlier in the day. I'm planning on purchasing a second one as this one fits perfectly in our lower cabinet microwave slot. I'm hoping this new one will last longer than three years..."
2,"It is not connected to AlisaOf Amason.Alisa does not recognizes it. So no voice order that bad for my blind husband . It was feature that I bought for. Spent hours to connect - Wifi Sygnal exist but connection is not established. Also to put time higher then 6 impossible- 7,8,9 does not activate , so need some kind of strange way. Not share that I keep it. Will try help fromToshiba"
5,Buen producto y muy buen precio
2,"This microwave has an automatic shut off function for when it over heats so it doesn't burn the house down. That's great! Except it over heats ALL THE TIME. I try microwaving two bags of steamed veggies and this thing throws in the towel. I gave it two stars for the quantity of frozen veggies it can microwave before it gets dramatic and gives up. On the plus side, it looks great in the kitchen! And the quick buttons are cool."
2,It was fine right up until the flames started shooting out of the little venty thing on the right side interior wall.I would not buy again.
5,The microwave is great . It is easy to clean and has serval usuefull functions
5,"We actually decided to get rid of the microwave... so we could install a nice Range Hood over our oven/range.  We have a nice toaster oven and that eliminates most uses of the microwave (and toaster).  However, the need to quickly reheat a cup of tea or coffee or left overs, held us back.  I looked for a SMALL footprint that could handle normal dinner plate, pyrex containers (up to 4 cup), or lg mug of coffee.  It had to take up small amount of counter space and it had to be stainless steel to match our GE Profile/Cafe appliances.  This one was perfect.  It was exactly what we needed and we gladly take the 700W for smaller footprint.  It only takes up back half of counter so can still use space in front of it for prep.  Its even GE so it matches, and it was under $100.  My wife says its cute too."
3,"glad i bought 1500w inverter, not 1000w as i though would be enough for 700w microwave"
2,"I've owned this product for about 4 years. It's digital clock has always run fast, gaining about a minute every month or so.During the time that I've owned it, it has worked reliably with infrequent use. I typically use it maybe once every week or two. I did use the kitchen timer feature daily.About a month ago, the machine started having problems.  Without it having been touched or used, the machine would issue a constant and ongoing ""BEEEEEP!"". It fixed itself after being unplugged and plugged back in. It did this about 3 times since. Then, yesterday, it barely heated/melted some butter and the machine seemed to smoke.So, the machine worked well with infrequent use for about 4 years, but now no longer seems safe.According to a websearch, a typical microwave should last 7-8 years with proper and regular use.This means my machine failed at around halfway thru a typical lifespan."
3,"So far we have been satisfied; however, today I tried the popcorn feature and the popcorn burned.  Any suggestions to what we might have done wrong?"
5,"This is a great microwave. That is an ideal size. Not too big or not too small. It has nice quick options on it, and has the +30 button that everybody likes the finish matches my other appliances and it looks nice in my kitchen. Heats up well and works great."
2,"I have had this micowave for a month now. Really wanted to like it, but the things I dislike are important features that this microwave just doesn't have.1.  The beep alert sound is way too low.  Even in the quietest setting you can barely hear it and I have extemely sensitive hearing.2. You can NOT adjust the power.  I've never had a microwave where you could not do this.  I've searched to see if I was missing something, a step, on how to accomplish this and it is just not there. Very disappointing as there are items that require 50% power and you can't get that with this microwave.3. The kitchen timer is crap!!!!! Another feature I use many times a day.  You can set it, but it will shut off to whatever the clock time is.  Example:  If I set the timer for 5 minutes and it is 2:02 in the afternoon, the timer shuts off at 2:02.  If I set the timer for 10 minutes, and the time is 4:15 pm, the timer shuts off at 4:15!  I've unplugged, try resetting, and get the same result every time!  If my husband had not thrown out the packing from the box, (I kept the box) this thing would have been returned within the return period.4.  The clock is weird.  Do not like that it shows a 0 in front of the numbers like military time when the time is not in the double digits.A complete waste of money for our family.  The only positive thing I can say, is the interior is attractive and easy to clean."
4,It fit easily. Worked immediately.  No problem seeing controls. Still to try air fry and convection cooking.
3,Arrived with small dent in front.  Still kept and using as I needed it asap
4,"A good solid unit, easy to use and well worth the price I paid."
2,"I've had the microwave for less than two weeks and the power went out.  It was plugged into a grounded plug in and while I steamed some vegetables, the power went off and the plug in's reset button went clicked out.  Got that pushed back in, but the microwave gets no power from this plug or any other in my kitchen.  Checked the fuse box, but everything else is working.  And have I mentioned it is the noisiest microwave I've ever heard."
5,Beautiful compact yet large enough counter microwave!!
4,"It’s 100% my fault for not accurately measuring, but this really is a small microwave. It’s fine for what it is, but don’t make the mistake I did. It doesn’t even fit a regular sized plate.It would be good for a college kid sneaking one into a dorm maybe!"
2,"I didn't get a great deal of time to really tell how good or bad this microwave would be because as soon as I plugged it in and started a test with a mug of water, the light started flashing off and on and my ears were hit with a crazy rattling sound. Unplugged and returned the same day it arrived. Shame too as I really like the idea of the grill, but not enough to put up with that kind of noise and light show."
2,The digital display went so dim that its impossible to use after the better part of a year and a half.  There is no fix.  The warranty only covers the oven for one year.  Buy something else if you want it to last because a search of the internet shows this to be  a common problem.
2,You need to add double the time for this microwave
1,"2 years, this microwave ran perfectly, then out of nowhere, I heard crackling coming from inside. It's on the inner right wall of the microwave. Thank goodness I was near it, because it started to smoke and had I let the microwave run and not be there, it could have started a fire. Do NOT buy this. It comes with a 1 year warranty only. My last microwave lasted me well over 10 years. Idk who in their right might thought this was ok. If you have this microwave, please be sure not to leave it running if you have to step away."
1,"I REALLY wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this microwave. Similar to what a lot of people have reported, the LED light started flickering after about a year and a half. It happens every single time I open the microwave. The LED light may not sound like a big issue but it's really irritating and disorienting. It's like a club strobe light - what a headache!It's clearly a manufacturing defect but you can't replace the LED light and Toshiba's limited warranty conveniently only lasts for a year. If I spend $100 for a microwave, I really expect it to function for longer than a year. It's also clear that it was a manufacturing defect because since October 2018, they no longer use an LED bulb. Unfortunately I was one month too early in purchasing this microwave.Extremely frustrating. Don't waste your money on this microwave. I've never had an issue with any other microwave I've had for years and years. I decided to ""upgrade"" my microwave which turned out to be a huge mistake."
1,"The door didn't close fully. Amazon is wonderful so I returned, and they replaced it within a day.The second one? Looked repackaged AND the door didn't close AT ALL!VERY disappointed!"
1,"Wish I had spent a bit more for something better. 700 watts is not enough power, takes too long to even heat a cup of water. Cant go by regular directions on frozen food packages, must increase cook time--and its your guess by how much! Plus it has an odd feature-if you stop it before the time you originally put in, then take it out and press stop...it doesnt stop, you have to press reset, then stop again and sometimes it will still keep going till the original time you punched it...drives me nuts. Its only a matter of time before I just go and get a better one/ Plus the keypad area, I found out real quick to use my knuckles to press the numbers--I have fingernails-normal length-but the slightest touch of them to the pad began to put dents, started to rip  the keypad- after first few days I realized what was going on then used my knuckles instead! The plate also shifts alot if anything heavy is put in-like an oversized mug filled with stew-the plate shifts right off the track, I found that very annoying. FYI a cup of soup takes 6.5-7 minutes to heat--my last one I cooked a frozen dinner right out the freezer to table in that time. Maybe it'd be good for single person minimal use..college dorm maybe."
1,"About 9 months after I purchased this microwave, the light started to flicker. First, occasionally, then much more often, then either flicker or go dark. I decided to ignore it. Today, exactly 1 1/2 year after I bought it, the glass turn table cracked and broke in two (plus a small piece). I did nothing different from my usual heat or reheat food and drinks.I thought Toshiba was a reliable brand. Turned out not to be.Last Toshiba appliance I buy."
4,Muy bonito pero el primero llego totalmente dañado lo volví a ordenar y el Segundo llego con unas pequeñas cuarteaduras en el panel de control
2,Turntable ring assembly was missing.  Touch buttons are inaccurate and not very responsive.
2,Not quite the quality of my 31-year-old short but powerful and very reasonably price
5,Got this to replace 10-year-old Emerson and I'm very happy with the purchase. The best feature is to be able to shut off the notification beeper! (Hold down the #8 for 3 seconds). Powerful enough for all of our needs in a smaller space saving model. It's very quiet when it's running too.
5,"This is a nice microwave that cooks food fast and is kind of easy to use.  I like the quick cook feature just push a one or two and it cooks on high for one or two minutes.  That seems to be the most I use it for.  I do see it has a popcorn setting, havent used it yet."
1,"The plastic smell won’t go away, it’s awful and I’m pretty sure it’s poisoning me with toxic fumes. I don’t know how to return it because I don’t have a return box. Such a hassle. It’s also very annoying because you can’t click “cancel” when the cooking it done, so you just have to listen to the very loud 6 beeps."
3,Poor design on the inside. Makes it more difficult to clean
5,"This is such a great appliance it rates as one of my favorite purchases of all time.It heats stuff great, but the best part of the whole thing is the “Sensor” cooking for reheating leftovers. You just throw your food in, punch the sensor cooking button, and that’s it! I love it!Inside is not any easier or worse to clean than any other microwave and I have always disliked that part of having a microwave, or a traditional oven for that matter.The spring button you press to open the door sticks some times. It seems to help some if you keep the prongs that are on the inside edge of the door and hold the door shut clean.Again, one of my all time favorites."
1,Microwave quit heating food after 4 months of use- bought it in Sept 2022. Reached out to Toshiba and crickets. Never buying from them again. Amazon was nice enough to offer a return even though the return window was closed. Shipping it back was more hassle than it was worth.
4,Was defective.  Would have reordered but not enough time for new year use.
4,"Box was damaged on arrival and the microwave itself is dented pretty significantly on the top edge about halfway back behind the control panel.  I was initially disappointed when I saw the damage, but decided to plug it in and see if it heated.I put in a coffee mug with some water and set it for 3 minutes.  The water was hot and steamy when I took it out!I keep a couple of those plastic covers that prevent splattering on the top of the microwave so I never see the damage anyway.Some people have said there isn't a light when you open the door.  I can verify that there definitely IS a light.  It's not the brightest and it has to shine through a grating in the right-hand side just behind the control panel.All in all, it does what I need and if it hadn't been damaged I would have rated it 5 stars."
3,Not worth the money for the size.
4,It works. It is loud though.
2,It’s very nice but  much . bigger than I expected. Very noisy as door is open and closed.
1,"One day short of a year of when I ordered this it had an electrical fire from the top area!No, I was not heating anything with metal- used the same cup I always used. No sparks just suddenly smoke pouring out! Small flames .  Unplugged it and shut door.Very scary!  And happened a year only!"
2,"Worked fine, was nice and compact. But now its arcing electricity after just 1 year"
3,"It's a lot smaller than I had anticipated, a regular sized dinner plate does not fit in it"
2,bought this on august 2nd it broke on november 27. randomly stopped working today it’s not heating anything at all and making a disturbing loud noise
1,"I just started using the microwave and it malfunctions!After heating the food, when you open the door it makes a loud sound and the word HOT appears.Then the initials of PF appear."
3,Like many other have complained about:  The light flickered and finally went out after about 10 months.  I've had it 13 months.  Toshiba Service is of no help.Otherwise its a good little microwave.Not super zippy - but decent.
5,Can live without. Beautiful style
3,"3.5 rating my be for now.CONS:(1) After 3+ weeks of use, still I see fumes in the oven after use (most of the time).(2) and burn smell sometimes.(3) taking slightly more time than past GE one with same capacity.(4) lesser window-glass view than my last one (of same capacity)(5) the base is not rotating, I need check/research on that why?Pros:Almost same sound as the old one."
4,"Works fine. One thing I dont like.Must hit ""time cook"" button to use exact times everytime you want to do non-full minute intervals which I think is annoying.Otherwise great product."
1,The media could not be loaded.I bought this instead of a different microwave that I liked the looks of better and very similar price based on the measurements picture they show... I was led to believe the opening on this microwave was 14.5 inches across and 9.1 inches tall It! NO! It is more like 12.9 inches wide by 8.25 inches tall.. I am talking about the OPENING only... not the entire dimensions of the microwave. Very misleading... I haven't used as we are debating if we want to return this one now.. so I cannot comment on anything else. I will say the door seems loose and doesn't exactly line up flush either.  Please see pictures.
2,"Everything works fine and like all microwaves you have to find figure out the quarks of each model. Like the beverage button. 1 serving isn't going to do it. Need at least hit that button twice, unlike my parents beverage button which 1 serving is  scolding hot.My biggest disappointment is the response of the buttons. You have to press very hard to get them to work. I wont by this brand of microwave again."
5,"I have been using my new microwave for the past 2 months and I am very pleased with it.  It's medium size, the controls are easy to understand and use and it cooks the food well.  It's not super fancy, just a good every day use microwave.  I read many reviews for lots of different microwave brands and models and I am very happy that I chose this one"
5,"I purchased this to replace a first generation microwave that came with the house I purchased. Fits great in small spaces, as I purchased it specifically to fit in a hutch/cabinet. However, it has enough capacity to fit a larger plate in it. I have two different sets of plates, and only one would fit previously. Now both do. Works much better than my old one and the family loves the easy convection feature. I like this little machine and would buy it again."
3,too big heavy
4,"I bought it specifically because of Alexa compatibility.  Several times already Alexa said there was a problem with the microwave and said they reported the problem to the microwave company.  One example is I tried to defrost and instead it cooked at full power with nothing telling me it had changed settings.  It ruined the food.  So far, saying,""Alexa, microwave for 2 and a half minutes"" and statements like that work.  I'm afraid to try anything else."
4,It works for what you want it for but I miss my convection microwave/oven comb that is broken and it costed me 500.00 to purchase  and they want almost that much money to repair or replace it:(
1,I microwave took double the time. It took me to heat up my food compared to the old one. I have another small microwave in another area of my house and it does not take half as long as this one dead garbage it is not to be sold to anybody else.
3,I'd like to know why I was charged 13900 over the price I see in the list?
2,"While the microwave preforms well, the legs are uneven and requires propping up one leg to make the unit sit level.the other issue is that the smoke does not exhaust efficiently and the smoke builds up inside."
1,I purchased this microwave less than a year ago and it’s already broken.
3,not what I expected price is reasonable you get what you pay for I guess!
4,"I really wasn’t expecting too much for 65 bucks but it’s actually a decent deal. There are a few things that are annoying, but I can live with. The dots between the numbers on the clock continuously flash after it’s been set. That’s the most annoying thing for me. The keypad doesn’t light up so you need lighting if using at night and it’s lightweight so it tends to slide around. I put it against the corner of my counter so that prevents it from sliding. Another thing, it has a built in handle/crevice which opens it then swings to the left. I can’t just pop the door open by pressing on the bottom like my old microwave. This is mostly just something I need to get use to. Hopefully it won’t be so annoying after a while. It’s only 700 watts and my old one was 800, so it takes a little longer to heat food. My10 inch dinner plates fit, which I was worried about. I mostly use it for reheating leftovers and making popcorn. The first time trying it I burned my popcorn, but hopefully I’ll get the hang of the timing soon! It has some cool presets, a kitchen timer and power setting. The numbers 1-6 can be used for express cooking. That means whatever number you push on, that’s how many minutes it will cook for. That means if you only want 15 seconds, you need to push Time Cook first and then the numbers 1 & 5, then start. That can be annoying but the expressing cooking is a nice feature. I love being able to turn the sound off, no more beep, beep, beep. The good thing is, it’s smaller than my old one, so it takes up less space on my counter, which is nice. I saved the carousel and wheel from my old microwave to keep my spices on. If I think of anything else or have any problems I will update."
1,"manual not included and customer service's link to manual led to a pdf with pages incomplete,unnumbered out of order and hard to follow. many of the buttons on the control panel did not respond or produce the response described."
4,After 6 months of use the inside panel on the right sparked and blew. I should've gotten insurance.
1,It arrived with a significant dent on the inside of the cooking chamber.  For us that made it unusable because the evidence of damage or mishandling raised questions of leakage  Will reorder and amend this review if appropriate.
3,Every time we cook something that takes longer than 6 minutes (presets) the clock gets messed up & we have to resetWe have never been able to get it to work with Alexa
1,"it’s really not worth any of your money. it didn’t even last one use. it took almost 45 minutes to heat food, even then, the food was barely heat up. heating it on the pan was more effective. this product is really a waste of money and amazon labeling it “amazon’s choice” is very misleading."
4,"Took a chance and went with this microwave after I read all the reviews. I love it it's quiet, not too big, heats food evenly. The only thing that is a minor thing, is the printing on the touchpad is a little small.  Otherwise it was an excellent purchase and worth the price and I ordered it on Monday and was here by Wednesday. I would highly recommend it."
1,"The box was damaged when it arrived and taped up. There was no manual and the microwave is extraordinarily LOUD. Maybe something happened to it when it was shipped to make it really loud like that? I have a photo of the damaged box, but it looked okay otherwise. ( no dent) It really sounds awful, so I am returning and will actually purchase one in person"
4,I bought this unit instead of a regular microwave because I needed a convection to heat Epacris seeds to 200 degrees to simulate a fire. I was very disapointed to find that it did not have a 200 degree setting.I have to insert a remote sensing thermometer probe and alternate between 150 and 250 degree settings to accomplish my purpose.
5,"My only issue with it is that there is a button for “cook time” and “clock” that is shared. If you hit it once you will be setting the clock. If you hit it twice, you say how long you want to cook it for. Should t that be in reverse?  My goodness. I have hit the set clock 3 times, ever, and I hit “cook time” every day. I keep meaning to look at the manual to see if I can change that. I do find it to be really aggravating but not enough to wish I had closed something else. It’s nearly the perfect microwave."
4,"The product is fine, but there is no owners manual in the package."
3,"I purchased this microwave in October of 2019, and it worked well for most of that time, but in recent weeks it's started to smoke when microwaving smaller amounts of food. I've also noticed that the paint on the top of the cooking area is becoming rusty and peeling away. I wipe down my microwave weekly and regularly leave it open to dry, so this seems unreasonable.Overall, I expect purchases of kitchen appliances to last longer than 36 months. I will not buy this brand again."
5,"This microwave replaced a top of the line Sharp model that my mom and dad bought in the nineties. If you haven't had a new one in a while, either, you are probably going to be shocked at the improvement in the technology.Inverter technology - this one has it!  Microwaves without inverter technology mimic the effect of lower-power settings (like defrost!) by alternating bursts of 100% power with zero power to approximate the results of lower power. Without inverter technology your turntable circles the entire cycle, but your defosting item is being cooked on full power a percentage of the time.  WITH inverter technology, if you set a cycle that uses 50% power your microwave is cooking at 50% the full cycle.This microwave also has sensor technology. That means that it samples the moisture and air temp inside the microwave to determine doneness! I haven't burned ANYTHING and instead of guessing, checking, guessing, checking, I hit the start button and come back to a perfectly heated bowl of food.WHO knew!"
3,"Bought this in September 2019.. the time cook and power level button no longer works, so we are left to use the 1-6 min fast buttons then pressing the ""add 30 secs"" button to go any higher. It also seems now that the power level is not as high and food is taking longer to heat up than it was before, but since the power level button doesn't work, we have to deal with it. Not too happy about that, but we will still use it so the job is still being done lol"
5,Worth the buy. Put it in my guest bedroom and it’s working perfectly well.
4,"Monday, September 12, 2022 Just got this microwave. Shipped and arrived perfect, looks great. I downloaded a digital manual for it, and it referred to the ""STOP/CANCEL"" button. I looked at the control panel and there is none?Only the printed manual (which is different than the digital one - for the same exact model) has a picture with a caption off to the side that says ""STOP/CANCEL"" and points to the ""Eco"" button? See the included picture.Huh?I'll update this review after we use it for a while, but the design of the control panel is very strange. The operation is also counter-intuitive as well."
5,This microwave replaced a older same type model and brand. This unit makes more noise then the old one (loud hum). Works well but it is noisy.
5,"Okay so I purchased this product at 3am one night because our old microwave kept catching fire and I had had enough. What I have now learned is that I am a terrible estimator of dimensions especially when tired because when my package arrived in the mail, I realized that I had not ordered a microwave so much as I had ordered a full sized 4 door sedan. This thing is roomy to say the *least*. We're a little tight on counter space and couldn't fit the microwave where the other normal sized one was. We ended up putting it on top of the fridge and it has done well there so far. For reference, the front of the microwave sits at the edge of the fridge right before the freezer opening starts and theres about 5-6 inches of room behind it (but I guess take that estimate with a grain of salt, I'm tired right now). We put anti-slip grips underneath the legs to keep it from going anywhere and after 2 months of use, we haven't had any issues.Now, regarding the microwave itself, it's very powerful and heats food very quickly and thoroughly. In past microwaves I've had issues reheating things like pasta and sauces where the center is always cold and I have to keep remicrowaving. This microwave hasn't shown that issue. I also really love the sensor reheat and keep warm features. The normal sensor reheat option works really well but everything was piping hot (which, I mean, I guess is the point) and it was difficult to remove from a microwave that sits above my head. But you can select ""more"" or ""less"" with the sensor reheat (and I think the sensor cook) options. Even selecting the ""less"" option still leaves my food plenty warm but I'm less likely to burn myself on the plate. I have never needed to select the ""more"" option because I am not a masochist.Setup was really easy and pretty quick. The microwave isn't flingable but given its size, it's actually a little lighter than I anticipated. The manual also explains how to use the different features and gives examples of what you can cook with the sensor cook option and I found that to be very helpful since I am a barely functioning adult (if you couldn't already tell).Here's some overall pros and cons:Pros:- Very powerful/quick cooking times- Easy to wipe down- Thorough cooking- Beeping is audible but not as loud as microwaves I've had in the past. For me this is a pro because my roommate and I have opposite schedules (I work nights) and I'm always stressed about waking her when I get home from work. There is also an option to turn the beeping off but this also turns the keypad beeping off and while turning the beeps on and off isn't hard, it's not as simple as hitting a button.- When the food is done cooking, the microwave beeps three times and then it is done. I hate when a microwave ""reminds"" you that your food is done by beeping every so often if you don't open the door. I didn't make it this far in life to be rushed by a machine, I will get it when I am good and ready.Cons:- Size is a little inconvenient but that's really on me for not paying attention and not making an effort to actually dimension out my kitchen.- I would really enjoy if there were just a button to mute/unmute the beeping"
5,I love the easy button time cook. Push a number and it will turn on and cook. Also has the 30 seconds add. Other microwaves I’ve had you have to push button the push on. Not this one. Love it!!  Also love the two tone color. Got a new coffee maker with the same two tone color
1,I've had this microwave since approximately the end of January 2023 and can no longer use it because it has an electrical burning smell when used. Of course the return window has closed as well.
1,"I waited to review this item to give a true review of it's performance. I highly recommend saving your money and investing in another microwave. The plate never stays in place, it's very slow to heat up food and is inconsistent in it's heating temp and speed... Sadly we are stuck with it and make do with what we have but next time i will definitely spend $20-30 more and actually be happy with my purchase."
3,"I bought this because I'm a fan of all in one and without 2 ovens an extra convection on my counter is very useful. Microwave has good power and is what it is. Air Fry, on the other hand is useless. There is no mention of air frying hardly at all in the handbook. All the air fry settings take incredible amounts of time to do anything, it's basically a honed down convection without the pre warmup. Don't buy it for the air fryer and think you will replace your standalone or deep fryer. 3 stars because I was fooled."
2,After three years it is rusting inside because moisture collects during normal operation—unacceptable  in a microwave. The fan is very noisy but is not effective in expelling moisture.
3,"Bought this microwave on Aug 23rd, received it a few days later, I used it a lot. I liked it! But it just blew up almost 2 years to the day I received it. I thought it would last longer than that. Broke with no warning. Lots of smoke, noise, turned it off immediately and unplugged it. I doubt if the warranty is still good for this. Very disappointed."
5,this mighty little microwave is wonderful.  i love that it has a handle as most have a psh button to open door which can be difficult for people with arthritic hands.  also most small appliances come with a very thin plastic film which you have to remove and are hard to remove.  this dandy came with blue film which was really easy to see and remove.Great buy
3,NOT A STURDY PIECE WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR SUCTION ON DOOR NICE N TIGHT HOWEVER NO WEIGHT TO MICROWAVE SO IT MOVES ACROSS THE COUNTER WHEN U OPEN THE DOOR WHICH I HATE SO I FEEL IF IT HAD MORE WEIGHT IT WOULD NOT  MOVE OUT OF SPACE EVERY TIME YOU OPEN THE DOOR NOT COOL WHEN I HAVE LIQUID
3,"I agree with others that the buttons are too hard to press on this model, and I also think that the light is pretty dim, though that bothers me less. My main problem is that after I cook something, the keypad becomes unresponsive. I have to press Reset to get it to work again. I can't find any information on this being normal operation in the manual, so I guess I got a defective unit. Back it goes, and I'll probably get a different model because the high keypad pressure you need to use for this thing is actually pretty annoying. A big disappointment -- I trusted in Panasonic quality."
3,Nice microwave but as another reviewer stated the film over the control buttons blistered up.
5,Large interior. Beautiful inside and out. Works like a dream. I have no complaints.
4,"Cheaply made, would be surprised if it lasts a month of daily use. The express function is not a good idea for the elderly to understand."
5,It was a gift to son and family…
2,"If you wanna hear your microwave all the way in your bedroom, than this is the microwave for YOU!Plus as an added bonus it will burn the heck out of the center of whatever you are cooking, while leaving the outside edges raw.Really bummed, was looking forward this this thing being awesome.I have it 2 stars, cause at least it didn’t start on fire the first time it was used.  That would be a 1 star for sure."
1,Waited weeks without microwave until the day I received the pkg. I got everything set up. Missing part - no turnable shaft. Completely useless.
4,"The item is ok.....good price , enough for heating up meals"
1,Horrible
4,"I got this for a small space.  It's easy to turn off the sound so it doesn't beep or ding or whatever, just does the job.  I do a few things over and over, so I've learned the sequence of buttons to push and don't have to look them up.  My family have to look them up, as they rarely use this machine.  The color is nice."
3,Regular microwave but need to clean it 3 times a day because it literally shows every single finger print or smudge on the front. Very annoying if you’re expecting a new “clean” look.
1,IT IS NOT HEAT AT ALL IT IS NOT WORTH IT and start make electric fair . iam sad because i spend good money in this and it is too bad
5,Panasonic brand is one of the best
5,Was delivered quick and does not take up too much space. Great energy output
2,Much bigger and heavier than expected. I returned it unopened but got a gift card credit instead of a refund to my bank account. Very unhappy. I won’t be ordering anymore items from Amazon over $50 in the future. If I have to return an item in the future then I can give a $50 gift card as a gift to someone. I don’t need a gift card. I purchase hundreds of dollars a month from Amazon Prime. Very dissatisfied.
3,"So this microwave is wonderful for small spaces, and so far works fine but the top of the microwave is dented in a few places. New items should not be dented any where"
5,"I replaced a 15 year old failing Emerson 900 watt unit with this one (increasing electrical problems and the interior paint along the door was peeling which caused sparking. Repainting the inside worked but looked clunky). This new unit is much quieter than the old one, so much so I was concerned it was not working!  I love the dark interior though it makes it seem harder to see the food. The light is a little weak being a cold white.  The power seems sufficient about the same as my old one. The alert beep is also quieter than the old unit. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would do it again.  Let's see if it lasts. I don't expect 15 years, but 6-8 would be nice."
3,"I loved it until it until this happened. I've never moved it except just enough to keep it clean under and around it. I clean the interior whenever it gets food on it. I don't understand why it broke so soon. Acoule of weeks ago, the interior light started flickering and I could feel this strange sensation. Thought it was the flickering light. Then shortly after the light went out  and I could still feel that weird sensation. So I checked it today and it's leaking radiation. Read the warranty. Wish I had bought an extended. Seems microwave manufacturers have tons of arbitration clauses, disclaimers and limits, just in case something like this happens.  I have been feeling a bit strange since this started happening. Hope it clears up. If it doesn't, I'll see the doctor and update this post.  I honestly was hooked on this brand and still don't want to believe it, but it's true. I was looking to replace it, because of the light, with a Panasonic with the child and extra safety features. Now I'm not sure if I want one at all."
4,"This microwave is the best especially for the price, looks sleek and heats up quickly, great product"
5,For a counter-top microwave this is perfect.  easy to use.  works very well.  quite powerful
1,It never worked when it was first plugged in.  Checked to make sure it wasn't the fault of our outlet which it wasnt.
3,I've never had a microwave sound this loud! It honestly sounds like it's going to explode. We got a replacement because I just couldn't believe it could sound the way it does but I was wrong. It is meant to sound like it's going to explode. lol Other than that we really like the super-easy button features like the 30 secs on the start button. The main reason we bought this microwave beside the reviews. I just didn't do enough homework for noise on this guy. You would think in this day in age that they could get the microwave to be quiet and not sound like it might break at any moment. lol
1,Bought this for my parent in October 2022 in January of 2023 when heating a breakfast sandwich up she said she smelled something burning and noticed a fire in the microwave. I told her to unplug it and throw it away. Don’t waste your money on this microwave.
5,Use everyday
4,"I expected low power, but not twice the amount time it took my old 1,000 watts microwave oven. The Toshiba EM925A5A-BS oven was highly regarded by the editors of Wirecutter, in the NY times. I knew that it had only 900 watts of power, but the Wirecutter article suggested that oven design often makes higher power meaningless, as there are high power ovens tyhat do not work as well as this one. I bought the oven with this review in mind. After 2 months of use I found that that I like several things a boyt this oven it has a small footprint, it is quiet, and it has a good control pad. However, the time required to heat food could be better. What it usually took 1 minute in my old Ostetrizer oven now takes two miniutes. It is not a big deal, really, but when you wait in front of a microwave oven for your food to get hot, one minute can feel forever."
4,Great little microwave. Fits nicely into small spaces.  The pre set buttons are really great and easy to use.The only downside is the door cannot be closed quietly.
5,It was the perfect counter top microwave
1,"The oven works well enough and certainly much quieter than our old one.  But the control pannel is impossible to read under normal home lighting conditions.  The aptly named ""Micro"" button is small and the grey on black lettering is so hard to read that we've resorted to using a flashlight. Seriously considering giving this one away and buying something else."
5,"This is a small 700 W unit. No point expecting it to heat stuff up as fast as a 1100 W unit. It has worked out well as a second backup unit for our bedroom closet. Particularly nice: it has the option to turn off all beeps, which is very nice for late night operation."
1,The media could not be loaded.It worked for six months and is now trash. I don’t even use it that often. This morning I went to heat up some bread for a few seconds and it no longer works. I didn’t put anything in there other than bread! Agh now I don’t have a working microwave.
5,Runs quiter and cooler than the new GE I had
3,"Pros: good for reheating foods, water for  coffee or tea. Cons:if you cook with a  microwave then this is not for you, Continues to beep after the oven has stopped ...this  is madding  if your busy doing other things  in the kitchen, most presets don't work on the one I ordered just the popcorn button"
4,n/c
1,"Purchased Nov 2021. Out of warranty I guess. Very troubling it has quit. At first I thought it was some problem with the plates I was using. It worked with some but not others. Never anything metal or gold  rimmed, I know that. .Finally it was clear, the thing is broken. Just a frightening sound. A defective item, although it worked for a year a month."
4,Warm food
4,"Ive had this microwave 2 years now and it's been.... okay.  After about a year the light went out,  so there is no interior light. Also at one point the beeping started slowing down and it sounded like a dying robot.  Speaking of the beeping, the beeps FIVE times when its done. That seems a little excessive to me. It also sometimes decides to stop microwaving in the midst of it....microwaving. Then i have to press the start button multiple times to get it going again. Nice looking microwave but it doesnt last in the long haul."
3,It made soggy but with some crispy edges frozen pizza.  Just a basic microwave
1,"I tend to believe this was an isolated incident; however, on multiple occasions this microwave made a flash of a fireball and a loud exploding noise while I was getting ready to remove food. btw, I have used microwaves for 30+ years, and am cautious to avoid any type of metal and even using non-microwave plates, etc. I know the was not a fluke as it happened twice to me. Then, my mother used it and it did the same think and she nearly had a medical condition. IT""S NOT AN SMALL LITTLE FLASH OF LIGHT LIKE THE YOUTUBE VIDEOS FOR GRAPES, THIS WAS A FIREBALL ENGULFING THE ENTIRE INSIDE OF THE MICROWAVE AND A LOUD BAM. VERY VERY VERY SCARY. Again, I have no problem with the ease of use - I love the one touch cooking feature. However, this problem was very scary. Not to get more technical, the back wall of the microwave ""browned"" from the big volley-ball flash of light- I believe behind that wall is the device that creates the 2.4gHHZ microwaves that cooks the food (esp., vibrating the water molecules in the food).  Oh, Amazon has the device in route - I alerted therm of this danger and they are taking the microwave back."
3,"For starters the unit has a 'quick 30s' button that doesn't start the microwave. You have to press 'quick 30' then press start.The 'technology' they talk about didn't work any better than any other microwave I've had. I will say that for the first month or so it did seem to be working really well. But after the first couple months of use, it’s just like a normal microwave at this point."
1,"This was disappointing. Within 2 days of using, microwave created a ton of moisture within and therefore made mildew. Not safe or sanitary for anyone. Beware!"
1,not heating. didn’t last a couple years.  not worth the $ . don’t even use often
1,This microwave broke after 3 months. First the light stopped turning on and then the door wouldn't shut.
3,It's a bit loud but works well
5,I buy GE cause my family worked and retired from General Electric
3,"I liked the microwave other than it totally died at 11 1/2 months.  I am still jumping through hoops to get the warranty coverage that was promised.  I gave up my Kenmore that lasted 12 years for this, a poor choice on my part.  NOTE  The warranty was honored so I am very happy with the product support"
2,Nice size. Easy to clean. Super disappointed that somehow I thought it had convection capabilities.
1,"I had a 8year or older Hamilton Beech microwave, that I popped popcorn. I simply set it for 3minutes +33 seconds...and it made the best popcorn serving ever. But I decided to upgrade to the new Toshiba. Yes it looks great, has good reviews... But I dialed in 3minutes & 32 seconds and it burned the popcorn into a blackened ball, and smoked up the house! So, I thought that possibly I need to read the ""instructions"".Using the same ""Jiffy-Pop"" bowl, and the same measured-amount of pop-corn, I selected the [Popcorn] setting. The time only read 1:50 and so I pressed [Popcorn] the 2nd time, giving a 3:00 time reading.And the Popcorn seem to be ""popping"" O.K....however only about half-the kernels popped, and so I put it back into the microwave, and pressed [Popcorn] again (thinking that another minute or so the totsl serving would be popped... But within 15 seconds...the popcorn was burning and the kitchen was being smoked-up! Immediately pressing [Stop] stopping this...and there again I have a burned-black ball of popcorn!= = =Surely it must be ME! not understanding how to microwave a 'serving' of popcorn...in which I had always flawlessly accomplished in my old HB microwave!Is there anyone our there for ""advice"" as to what am I doing wrong??? Surely, this wonderful looking Toshiba can popcorn! That is primarily the only ""microwave"" thing I do...is to popcorn!"
2,"Exactly after 1 year it starts to lose power so much heating time is 25% longer, for exactly the same thing we are heating. Other than reliability issue it's very good: noise level, ease to clean, interface etc."
4,Got this about a month ago to replace a 1000 watt that was tripping breaker sometimes.Like it fine so far except for the excessive beeping.Five when one is enough.
1,"it's ok and so far it's working ok.. but the noise is a bit louder than previous Microwaves I've had in the past. I used to buy another brand for years, but earlier this year the company was giving me a hard time regarding the warranty so I decided to switch over to Toshiba. Hopefully, Toshiba will take care of me if something goes wrong with this one.  Good Customer service and warranty are the main reason why customers coming back and buy the same brand/company. update, in July, i called Toshiba regarding the warranty - the Microwave simply stopped working. They claim that the purchase date is what they go by and not when i receive the Microwave.  Even though i called weeks before the one year warranty due date, i was told it's past warranty DATE.  The microwave lasted less than a year - Bad microwave and bad customer service.  I do not recommend anyone buy this Brand. So upset how they handled the warranty issue."
3,The media could not be loaded.Plugged  it up to try it out.put it on 30 seconds.at 23 seconds it started smoking🤔
4,Very sleek looking! I enjoy how it works I was disappointed when I realized it was dented in the back from shipping but Amazon customer service was wonderful and assisted me with the problem. All in all the microwave is small but perfect for a small house or apartment and is very powerful!
2,I ran the simple cold water test which did not boil nor did this unit come close to advertised watt/heating ability.
4,"This microwave oven does what it is supposed to do. It looks nice, too. It is certainly worth the money.This was knocked down a star when we found the plastic ring track for the rotating plate was shipped broken. However, we called B&D and they sent us a replacement ring track for free. All is well now."
2,"It's a fair to decent small microwave.  After 2 years of light use, it started rusting on the inside for no apparent reason.  Now 3 years later it is pretty yucky looking inside.  From the beginning it has taken longer to cook things that I had expected.  Based on the price and the nice way it fits on my counter in my small galley kitchen, it was worth the purchase price, but if you're looking for something that lasts more than a few years or if you're looking to cook bigger items, this may not be it."
1,"Look, it isn't 1985, microwaves should at least be big enough to fit a bag of popcorn.What a travesty.It is rare I am so upset about a purchase."
1,"Didn't always heat the same each time for the same time, and it must have an Internal timer bc since I bought it lots of people have stated that within a month or two after the warranty was up it just quit working. I just went to use it, and it wouldn't even turn on and it was burning hot inside and out. Had to unplug it, not sure what caused it to heat up while it was not running but it did."
4,"If you want to cook a big thing you might like this. Personally, I wish they would kill the mandatory 3 beeps when anything finishes a cooking cycle. Hate the beeps."
5,Nice product was bigger than I thought.....really the new stand was not compatible otherwise great buy
5,"We purchased two of these Farberware microwaves (dairy and meat). I purposely did not choose the smaller (and somewhat less powerful) model (a) because we have the counter space available for this model; (b) the speed which the extra power gives is well worth the tradeoff; and the larger unit allows, naturally, for putting in larger plates of food.I have been using microwaves for decades and I've not experienced a quieter, smoother and simpler warming and cooking experience."
1,Makes rattling noise within a month after purchase.
2,I’ve had the microwave for a year. Buttons started to wear out after a few months. Difficult to clean due to element on top
1,"Yes, this microwave failed within one year.  Wouldn't heat.  Contacted Toshiba who said they would send me a refund within 10 days.  Over 10 days and no refund.  Although this microwave has a high rating, don't expect any warranty or help if this unit fails.  The seller apparently misled us in actually issuing a refund.  There was a one year factory warranty not has not been honored at this point in time.  The seller, also has misled us by ""guaranteeing""  a refund would been sent, but none has been received."
1,"Update.  Second new microwave died within 3 months of purchase.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!Microwave turn-table broke in the first 60 days, making horrible sounds & not turning.  Getting a run around from manufacturer who outsourced answering of customer calls to someone who can only say mail in the warranty card & tell them your problem.  Won't provide a extra copy of the warranty card or give a phone number to get one."
1,Second one I bought and smokes seems like it will blow! Cheaply made and fire hazard.
4,"Door is very stiff to open. Cooks good,easy to clean. Light stays on whenever door is open, this l don't like as l always left door open to keep moisture from staying in unit. Now l have to wipe it down & have it stay open a bit after cooking then shut it."
1,"There are a few problems with the design of this oven:1. If the kitchen timer is in use, the microwave cannot be used. This is the first microwave that I have owned where that is the case. My first microwave, purchased in the mid-eighties, had that functionality.2. The window is semi-reflective which makes it near impossible to see the food inside.3. The glass carousel chipped really easily. Perhaps the one I received just had a defect.3. Lastly, stopping and clearing the timer makes more noise than just letting it run out. Sometimes, I like to stop the microwave and press the clear button so that the noise doesn't disturb others.Lowered to one star. The power control setting is just bizarre. For instance, if I set it to power level 5 what happens is the microwave cooks at FULL POWER for the time set, beeps, and then cooks for an additonal 5 seconds. If I set the power level to 9, it cooks for the time set, beeps, and then cooks for 9 more seconds. No matter what the power level is set to, it cooks at FULL POWER. I tried this experiment with a different, older Panasonic microwave and it exhibited the same behavior."
1,"Looked good enough.  Bought only for the claim it worked with Alexa.  Neat, I thought.  Nah.  Following their setup instructions, the first few steps are easy enough.  Then you go to teach Alexa the skill so you can voice control the thing, and it takes you to a Mideast air conditioning app where you'll be prompted that your brand new password just created for the the MSmartLife app doesn't work.  Well, of course it doesn't, on an unrelated hvac app.  Called midea tech/cs.  They ""opened a ticket"" for me.  Got a call back days later asking if I'd set it up following the instructions, which I had and had already confirmed for them.  Then I was told to go to YouTube and watch ""the video"".  I asked which video, and was told ""it will be right there"".  All reviews of the Alexa skill for this microwave are 1 star and many reference this exact roadblock.  Toshibe/midea is not helpful.  Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks and just buy any old microwave that isn't supposed to work with Alexa, as that will work equally as well with Alexa as this one."
1,dislike Returned to Amazon after two days. Used to heat soup ran for two minutes took soup out and returned for one more minute heat. Microwave would not turn back on ran for 2 seconds and then off.Unable to clear or reset. pushed rest unplugged child lock on off. All of sudden worked again. When through process three different times. Was unable to reach panasonic tech support. In frustration returned to amazon and will not be buying another panasonic anything.
4,Does what it is supposed to do. No problems.
3,"Its best feature is it is powerful, cooks faster than previous one by a lot, besides that its not the best.  No quick start buttons, which is a very much missed feature.  Popcorn buttons dont work and burn the popcorn even if you set it to a smaller bag size than what you put in.  Doesnt vent well, steam builds up on the window and just seems to stay there.  I like the look and once you relearn your normal cooking times, if will save you some time.  Expect to burn the top of your mouth until then.  Over all I wouldnt buy again"
3,"Did not last long, disappointed."
1,"Owned for less than three months. There is some kind of defect in the interior. I discovered this when the right inner wall of the microwave started sparking and then caught fire. I’m calling GE customer service on Monday for a refund. It’s a nice-looking microwave and worked well for the few months I owned it. I’m no expert, but microwaves generally shouldn’t catch fire. Luckily I was close by and could put it out right away."
2,"Microwave worked very well for 15 months before the control panel freaked out - resulting in the microwave turning on without any buttons being pressed (dangerous!). Usually with microwaves, it's cheaper to buy a new one than it is to have an older one fixed, so I'm disappointed this lasted only from March 2017 until June 2018. But life goes on."
3,"OK for the price but the door makes a big clang when you open and close it, the 5(!) alert beeps are loud and obnoxious and the control panel is awkward. But it cooks and warms food just fine and the prices is reasonable. Just nothing special."
5,The price has gone up since I bought it but the tech this microwave uses is next level. At $206 the microwave is a bit pricey but if you can get it for less it's well worth it. Also at 1200w this thing just flies through cooking or heating food.
5,"I needed something fast ,it work fine for what I need it for"
1,There's no light inside! Doesn't complete even a five minute set time.
2,My old Sharp 1100 watt microwave died after 18 years. When I got this 900 watt Toshiba I knew I may have to adjust cooking time a little with the frozen foods I use it for. Using the directions on the box in a dinner with meat and potatoes the meat was cooked ok but the potatoes were frozen on the first pass then dry and choppy at the end. Frozen pancakes come out hot but the bottom one was stiff and chewy as were breakfast biscuits. So it's not so much the cooking time but the inconsistency. Toshiba should have stuck to TVs.
1,Just spins continuously even after unplugging for a while.  Doesn’t heat.
4,"Easy to use.  Quiet.  Turntable plate doesn't stay ""anchored"" very well however.  Tends to float off the ""teeth"" that are supposed to keep it still."
5,It works just fine.
2,"Returned.Very loud, rattled/vibrated like crazy!Not as small as I was looking for either.Easy return."
5,"I looked at consumer report. I didn’t buy the top of line, but middle of the road. Happy !  However, brand new should not have dent in front, question if it might have been return."
5,"Powerful, quiet, roomy, user friendly, tough. So far so good after two Samsung microwaves and a Samsung fridge made me dump that brand on appliances. They are only good making two things: TVs and cell phones. Now I feel safe with this Toshiba microwave and a Whirlpool fridge. Pay attention to the experts, not the brands."
3,Delivery prompt. Microwave good.Unfortunately I've been using less than a month and the plastic coating on the keypad has already bunched up and is peeling.I owned same microwave for eight years before and never had this problem.
4,"We have had this microwave for a few weeks now. Works great. Prettier than I expected from the picture. Big enough interior for my needs. I like the dark interior. Fairly quiet. My only complaint is that its ""finished"" signal is 5 loud beeps which do not stop if you open the door. A minor point, just a little annoying."
3,The handle broke off within two months and there’s two adults in our house so there wasn’t any chance of abuse I went ahead and fixed it myself by putting a bolt and apoxy  through it since it was completely shattered off inside cheap junk
1,"This microwave worked fine for the first 2 years.  Then when I was out of town, a friend stopped by to check on my house and thank goodness she did.  The microwave was running by itself.  There was no way to turn it off except to pull the plug.  When I got home I tried to plug it in and it immediately started running.  None of the buttons work so no way to stop it except to unplug it.  I looked it up online and it looks like the motherboard burned out.  There are others on here that have had the same experience.  Beware this can happen before you purchase."
3,"The instructions that come with this microwave are a joke. The QUICKSTART  doesn't tell you much. There is a downloadable manual that's a bit more informative but not by a hell of a lot. I finally got it to work by sheer accident. It  does work pretty good. I have a much older version of this oven that worked flawlessly for years 12 I think. It didn't have the air fray stuff on it like this one does. I suppose that's the reason for the control snafu on it Who Knows? I sure don't. I don't know if I'd recommend this thing or not? It's ease of operation is anything but. Who needs this crap? Why not just write up a good, easy to understand instruction manual with it instead of one that's written by engineers?"
4,If you don't have an inverter microwave it will not cook right. I had another Panasonic from 10 years ago with an adult inverter. I can tell already this one is better. It cooks evenly. The auto cook works good too. I had it on my lists when the price dropped so I'm very happy. For safety I bought the 4 year extended warranty so I'm good for a while.
1,I had received one that had some damage on the front control buttons so I returned it and was sent a new one and have the same issue again.  It works but doesn't look that great. Now I am just done with the entire thing will probably donate it and buy a different microwave.
4,"Does have short instant cook button, controls are a little complicated and its inside is smaller than I expected with the larger 1.2 c.f. oven"
1,I BOUGHT FARBERWARE THINKING IT WAS A QUALITY NAME.TICKS ME OFF. I WATCHED A YOUTUBE AND ITS NOT A BULB. ITS A CHIP.  SO NOW I GUESS I HAVE A MICROWAVE WITH NO LIGHT FOREVER. I CANT AFFORD WHATEVER A REPAIR SHOP WOULD CHARGE TO REPLACE THIS.  PROBABLY COST MORE THAN THE MICROWAVE COST.  THIS IS STUPID.  I GAVE THIS A LOW RATING EVEN THOUGH IT DOES A FINE JOB OTHERWIZE.
4,"Small but holds a dinner plate, barely."
5,"Works great, heats quickly, and fits into smaller spaces easily."
3,Not liking door. You push a button and door should pop open but it doesn't you have to push button and pull open
3,"As a microwave I like it, but the other functions are difficult to use. I've never had an air fryer or convention oven so I was looking forward to using this. First thing I noticed is how big it is. Because it is a convention oven/air fryer it takes up a lot of space and needs air flow behind it. It works in microwave just as you would expect but none of the buttons are backlit and are dark colored on black background which makes things difficult to read. The convection oven part works ok and cooks well, just pick your temperature preheat and cook. The air fryer function is very frustrating! There are codes for what you want to air fry but it doesn't say what they do. The instruction booklet is awful! It is very vague when talking about the air fryer function. It doesn't tell you anywhere what the codes are so you never know what code setting to use for what food. I was able to get it to air fry some things by trial and error but got so frustrated trying to guess that I just went out and bought a separate air fryer. When in air fryer or convection mode the outside gets very hot! My cat jumped on top during cooking and hurt his paws. Because of all the problems I only use this as a microwave. I would not recommend buying this, it was a waste of money for me and if I knew then what I know now I would have just bought a standard microwave."
1,"Had this in an office kitchen, got fairly regular use each day at lunch.  After about 19 months, it quit heating.  Still turns, light comes on, makes normal humming noise, but the food just does not get hot at all.  Tried to look up fixes or reset options, this unit does not even have a reset button.This unit is also way too complicated - we just needed something that can heat up and defrost.  This has 200 other features that junk up the control panel making it hard to figure out how to simply heat up some lunch.Chinese junk, not worth the money."
2,So small and not powerful at all. What should take 2 minutes to cook it'll take 10. It'll definitely fit on a countertop but not worth it.
1,"This is not a ""microwave"".  It is less successful heating anything than a child's toy is.  It is inconsistent.  It heats less fast than heating on a stove top. Do not buy this.  It is misclassified as a microwave.  I wish I could return it."
4,"Keypad is frustratingly insensitive. You have to scrub your finger around on the key to make it touch the contact. Also, who decided that rotating  the plate so the cup handle is exactly where it was when you put it in was an absolutely critical feature? I would rather it just stopped when it’s done. Otherwise it’s fine, fits in the same space as my old microwave, heats the food adequately, etc."
3,"It rocks back and forth sitting on the counter so I looked under it and it’s dented.  Don’t want to deal with sending it back, because who knows if the next one will be better or worse.  Seems to work ok so far.  MAD ABOUT IT!"
1,"It looked good on my counter and it was exactly what I wanted, but it didn't work. I plugged it into all the outlets in my kitchen, but found no signs of electrical life.  I ended up buying a $55 microwave from Walmart.  I have a hard time getting around, so I paid $12 to have UPS pick it up.  This was a disappointing experience."
1,Burnt food. Undercooked food. It took 20 minutes to heat a frozen dinner. And next time went to put some nuts for 30 secs and it came out burnt. Called Amazon and they started telling me if I had put something that I shouldn't have put and trying to put the blame on me. I got pissed off and complained and got a supervisor and they said they would send me a replacement. Waiting for it now. Let's see if it works. AMAZON STOP PUTTING AMAZON'S CHOICE ON CRAPPY PRODUCTS. I am never again buying anything that was recommended by Amazon. You are losing my faith.
3,"I wanted a smaller microwave. This is tiny and  small portions take much longer to heat. I knew there’d be a difference, but it takes 3 or 4 times longer!"
3,I bought this for my elderly mother. It's simple and easy for her to use. Exactly what inwas looking for. We are very pleased with this product!
5,Easy to use - fits in compact space
2,"1. I use the microwave mainly for warming up leftovers and meals, and for popcorn.2. I am 80 and the numbers and words are too small to see.3. I could return it, but I've used it for a week and the others won't fit in the space I have for it.4. It looks easy to clean, but I haven't cleaned it yet.At my age, I would definitely buy one with a handle to open the door, as I don't need a child lock."
2,"While the unit itself seems to be working well, I am not impressed by the fact that the interior, white lining/coating is peeling off.  At this point I'm just hoping that peelings don't fall into my food."
4,"So far so good. When our last microwave started sending up smoke signals I wanted something petite, hopefully quiet, and not insanely expensive to replace it. This ticks all the boxes! I don't find the auto-start options real intuitive but then that's true of most of the options on the market, I think. The option to silence all beeping is MAGICAL and I don't know why this is not a standard feature on every single appliance. it has a bit of an odd sound when running; it's quiet, but it almost sounds like a motor that's running down, or weak? Not too concerned as it does heat well, but it's kind of off-putting and it's why I took off a star - it does not instill confidence. Same wattage as my last microwave so no surprises there. The keypad has gotten very noticeably dirty very quickly but that's probably not the microwave's fault..."
4,Live the push buttons. Never again a dial to turn. Love the 30 second intervals. And the push 1 -5 for minutes. Great features. I tested where heat goes by toasting coconut. Hits center. Was very good to know even with a turntable.
3,Good size.sound off/on works.The only problem I have us the clock.Every time I set the clock it changes the time on its on beyond hours ahead how can this be fixed??
1,First use I noticed the lack of power and uneven heat distribution.  I was microwaving popcorn and it couldn't even do that correctly unpoped kernels and burnt popcorn.  1 week in the push button for the door won't work.  2months  in the microwave has loud popping sounds and won't heat  anything correctly ... spend the extra cash and get a good one . Stay away from this one !!!
5,It’s quiet and works just like it should. I haven’t used the air fryer function mostly cause I don’t want to clean it yet.
4,"Connecting this to Alexa was beyond me, and I have over 10 active connected devices but the integration of apps and wifi kept dropping connections so I gave up.The unit itself is good, but to heat anything for less than 1 minute requires 2 button pushes before putting in the time.1-9 buttons when pushed will cook for that  many minutes.Something I really like, when the power goes off and comes back on again, you don't need to reset the clock."
5,I will never buy an above range microwave again. They are very expensive and don't last. Instead I put a shelf in and installed a counter top microwave. It looks great and allows me to have spice racks on each side. I love this setup and when the microwave needs replacing it will be a cinch to do.
3,"Works ok.  Quick cooking, buttons are a bit hard to push  other wise does the job"
5,I like this microwave except for how loud it is. We've had it for months and so far so good except that 1 thing. I probably would've looked for something different if I knew this.
1,"I initially ignored the fact that this microwave is really loud and rattles constantly when in use. But then one day I microwaved some food for my 2 year old son and it tasted like burnt plastic. I figured it was maybe that the food was too old from the freezer (although it shouldn't have been), but then the next thing I microwaved had the same bad taste. I then noticed that when I opened the door after it finished cooking, a small amount of smoke came out of the microwave. I immediately stopped using it again for fear of a fire and poisoning my son. It lasted about 4 months."
2,"After intensive research, we bought this microwave and have used it at a moderate pace for just over two years. The unit stopped working after 2 years and 1 month! Not acceptable!"
3,"So, first of all, it took a long time to get here and when it came it was in a beat up box with no manual. The manual is important on this one because the buttons are not standard. I found the manual online, but it was written in odd English, that means translated from Chinese? to English without really understanding the English language. I can't figure out if the features on this work or not because some things work and some things do not without extra steps such as figuring out which power is on. You can't just push a button and have it work, which is what most of us are used to. The power level is important because if you can't access it then your food gets overcooked, which is what I experienced. I am considering returning it, which is always a hassle."
3,"When I unpacked the unit, I found a piece of cardboard in the interior of the unit. I have owned many microwave ovens and have never had one that had a piece of cardboard in the interior of it. Thinking that it was part of the packing material I took it out, bending and breaking the cardboard. One removed, it seemed like the cardboard belonged in it because it was covering something that obviously needed to be covered. After calling the manufacturer I learned that this was a critical permanent part and had to order another one. I can only surmise that BandD used cardboard as a cost saving feature, rather than a metal plate. I can't imagine that it will hold up over time due to normal splattering, steam that develops cooking some items, that the cardboard will decay and need to be replaced. The unit may work fine but if I had known that BandD cheaped out, I would not have purchased it."
2,The mcrowave doesn't heat up correctly  and the  button panel wears out quickly. I'm giving it two stars because its small and I can make due with it.
2,"Very well made (much better than the old RCA model it replaced). It heats well and evenly but the firmware in it has a few glitches requiring a firmware reset by the removal of power from the unit for 20 seconds or so. It happens so often I have now put the oven on a plug-in switch. These glitches often result in the buttons not working on the front panel and the alarm sounding continuously for 20 seconds or more when the door is opened.Also, the LED light inside isn't near bright enough. And the buttons for entering the cooking time and power are often very slow to respond, which is annoying. And, I really don't like the touch-type buttons. I much prefer buttons that provide tactile and/or audio feedback when touched.Either something is wrong with the oven I received or the company didn't adequately test the firmware in this model before approving the design for sale to the public."
4,"Husband only uses microwave function. It is quiet. A crisper pan and two air frying racks are included bonuses to this reasonably priced microwave. Likes - 3 in 1 function. 2. Accessories included. 3. Affordable for social security household. 4. Downloadable user manual, one less manual for hubby to misplace. 5. MW interior lighting allows viewing of cooking items. Dislikes - 1. Number pad is not illuminated. Keeping a small flashlight nearby is necessary 2. The cooking is completed beep can not be turned off."
4,"The plug sticks out when placed in wall socket, so had to have a 'flat' short extension cord to make more room on the shelf.  The door takes a hard push in the center of the door to close and it makes a loud click-so no hiding treats in your microwave or all the family will know. I placed little rubber no skid pieces under the feet in the front so it wouldn't slide around. All the buttons are spot on, but I don't like the power level button. You have to press it multiple times to get to the power level you like, then set your time. The defrost button is great for softening butter.  The timer buzzer could be louder. I relied on my old timer and this one isn't loud enough if I'm in another room. It's also not irritating enough if I'm in the same room, so I tend to ignore it."
1,Fit perfectly in my new remodeled kitchen. Only work for 1 month. All die but one button & clock. To late to return.
5,Smaller than I thought but it works great
4,Love the small size. It works well and goes well with my other GE appliances.
5,This microwave is exactly what i needed and wad perfect for what the price was!
5,"Received the new machine a couple of days ago. Our old Panasonic microwave was nearly the same size, was twenty years old, and still worked. Amazing for something used several times a day. As a matter of fact, the glass dish inside is the same as the one in the new machine so we will keep as a spare. Have played with some of the features and so far like the inverter technology (the way it heats). All in all, happy with our choice."
5,"my mom's caregivers have one night off a week, so it's me and my elderly, memory impaired mom heating up food in the microwave on wednesday nights.  until now, we were using the costco panasonic 1.3 cu microwave.  it's interesting how the design can mean night and day for a user like my mom.to make the panasonic usable, we put 3 colored stickers to help guide her to what to press.  but now that we have the google assistant enabled toshiba, she simply puts the food in, and i turn on the microwave with the proper settings from thousands of miles away.  ding!  food is ready without any raised voices or hair pulled.i think overall this interface is really preferable to the panasonic and quite well thought out.  most importantly, there is a genuine pull handle--not a push eject button.  for elderly, finding yet another hidden button is torture.  everyone knows what a pull handle is!  also, for in person operation, i love that you simply press the START/30 second button and it starts cooking.  that's pretty much most of what i do.  with the panasonic you have to first press a 30 second button and then press a start button.  over a human's life, that's 2 trillion presses i have saved.lastly, the clock sets itself.  we just never bothered setting our panasonic's, because it was simply a matter of time before the power did something and we'd have to reset it again.if only the toshiba was sold in a place that had costco return policies, then it'd be heavenly. but still, it's a better deal overall than our previous costco microwave. if you are remotely helping someone prepare food, this is the only remote controlled microwave that utilizes a handle interface as of 8/2022"
5,It works.  Will update this review if there are any issues.
5,"Buen producto, hasta ahora ha cumplido con mis expectativas. Buen precio, entrega en buen estado y a tiempo."
1,It doesn’t work
5,"Since I burned up my old microwave (complete user error lol) I decided to get on Amazon & see what I could find to replace it. The space in my cabinet where the microwave is housed is small so this item fit perfectly! Super simple to unbox & set up. I think I had it unpacked, in place, plugged in, & the correct time set within 2 mins of bringing it inside. The stainless finish compliments all my other appliances well. Unbeatable for the price."
1,"Last Panasonic microwave oven lasted over 15 years before breaking. Liked it so replaced with this model. Today got the H97 error code, so basically it’s toast, only 2 years old. Last Panasonic microwave I will ever buy! Worked well until it didn’t, but very noisy."
5,"My older, smaller microwave just never seemed to work well.  It always need more time than the item suggested and after the panel started to act up, I knew it was time to upgrade.  So glad I did.  This thing works well and love the features for fast minutes and adding 30 seconds, not that I need to add time anymore, but it's nice to just press 3 to get 3 minutes and it goes.  Cannot complain, even though it might be bigger than I needed, but better to have it and not need it than to not have it and need the bigger space."
2,"Not a fan of this microwave, does not heat food evenly at all. Will have to replace."
3,"I replaced my previous microwave due to the endless beeping sounds with each use.The Toshiba silent mode works well.  I immediately activated it and have no complaints. Once the sound is off it stays off.My complaint is the door closing cannot be done without making a loud noise. Even with care, closing makes too much noise. Attempting to Close the door slowly creeks like a rusty hinge and still loudly slams. The microwave is a cheaply made metal box and it amplifies the sound of closing. The handle is just a push/pull, with no lift to release."
1,"GE refuses to provide a printed manual even though an insert with the microwave says they will. I do not have a printer to print a .pdf. They claim it is for the environment but more likely it is for them to save money,"
2,"I just received this microwave today, took it out of the box got ready to set it up, and the inside still had dry food stuck to it and the glass bottom was greasy and dirty! It was described as good as new! I have not cooked in it yet because I need to clean it first!! Not really happy with the shape it came!! I hope it works better then it looks! There are even fingerprints all over the front door of the microwave! I have no idea why it was cleaned and sanitized before offering it for sale!!!"
1,"Original product received sparked/smoked when reheating food (no metal was present in the microwave). Unit was replaced by Amazon. Now - after 90 days of use, the microwave is getting glitchy. It beeps for extended periods of time after use (pressing buttons/opening/closing does not stop it), and you are unable to use while you just wait for the repetitive beeping to stop. It's very frustrating/concern."
3,"INTERIOR SPACE SMALLER THAN ANTICEAPATED , POOR FIT AND FINISH"
4,"Product works as advertised.  It fit my space.  30 sec button is handy.  Haven't used all features yet.  Seems fast to heat and seems fairly even heating.  The LED light inside was important to me too (although the light is harshly bright if you look at it).  Not all models have this. Somewhat quiet overall during heating, better than our old microwave.  Door seems somewhat lightweight and flimsy.  We hope this microwave lasts."
3,"I don't usually write reviews but of all the things this microwave could get wrong, it was a simple light bulb. Sure, it microwaves food as you would expect. However, do not be surprised when the light bulb starts flickering and eventually goes out completely 1 or 2 years in. I was an optimist and thought the light bulb could be easily replaced, but alas, I can't be bothered to test the connection with a voltmeter, find whatever light bulb they used, and solder a new one in. Unlucky..."
4,"I've only had this for a few weeks now which is not very long to really give much of a review. I've not had the opportunity to try all the features. I'm not really sure I'll need to. Most of my uses of this are reheating and thawing, which this does very well. This is my second Panasonic microwave, the first one lasted for well over 20+ years and I'm hoping for the best with this one.  This one has much more power, a larger diameter turn table and is much quieter operating. With my aging eyesight I find reading the control panel somewhat  difficult in limited lighting, but other than that it's fairly simple to operate, it does what I want and i'm quite happy with it. The price was reasonable as well."
5,"Me gusta este modelo , buena tamaño , ni muy chico ni muy grande, lo justo para tamaños reducidos, trabaja excelente  , lo recomiendo 100 x ciento"
2,"The microwave was installed and did not work. The RCA customer service process was lengthy, cumbersome, answers ultimately unhelpful. It was easier to return to amazon than to deal with the microwave."
1,"To change a burned out Light Bulb was almost impossible. And we are pretty handy with Home Repairs. You have to pull the entire case off to get to it. The case is put together with completely round rivets, and can't be removed by any type of Screw Drivers. My Ace Hardware guy couldn't figure out how to remove the casing either. Also Nowhere in The paperwork does it say what kind of Light Bulb to buy. There are many different kinds. Theres no website or phone number to contact them that I would ever find. Including in my Manual I received with the Microwave! I finally found a similar looking Light Bulb at Walmart online that cost $22. I would say it took us 10 hours research and work to change the Light Bulb! This Microwave was not intended by the manufacture to ever be worked on in anyway. Not even to change a simple Light Bulb! This was ridiculous. I will NEVER buy another Farberware product again!"
3,"Bought this microwave because of the Alexa integration. The MSmartHome app you are forced to use to setup the microwave on your home network DOES NOT WORK. It will not complete the setup and now the main reason I bought this microwave is a 'no show'. Very disappointed. Please Google reviews on this app before you purchase. It seems there has been MANY ISSUES with it and the associated Alexa skill. I tried to find support, but it's a Sunday and they are closed. All the videos online to show how to setup are using the older app, not the one you must use now. This may be the first return I have with Amazon.UPDATE: I did not return the microwave. Toshiba tech support reached out to me a week ago, but nothing since. I figured out the issue and resolved it myself. It appears there is an issue with Samsung phones and wi-fi 6 with certain apps. This is an ongoing issue that I just learned about. To resolve it, I updated my router setting for the IPv6 LAN Assigned Type (TP-Link brand router). It was set to SLAAC+Stateless DHCP. Once I set it to DHCPv6 I was able to connect to the microwave on the 2.4GHz network and configure it finally. This change also fixed all my app issues with my Samsung phone. Upgrading the review from 1 star to 3 stars since I had to figure this out on my own with little to no support from the manufacture or app developers."
4,Es muy buen producto facil de limpiar no ruido
3,"The key pad is very insensitive. The tech support is not very knowledgeable. Not impressed by it's sensor cooking.But once one gets past this, it seems to work ok although I've only had it a few days.  I bought is for the wattage and price."
1,"Had broken parts, box was beaten up.  Called number given for product support or replacement parts and did not have the option. Severely disappointed."
2,Past MWs have always had a shaft with a flat side to attach turntable. This has basically 3 protrusions on bottom and the glass turntable. It just sits on and is continually popping off and will probably shatter the turntable at some point. I don't recommend buying this but with my luck it'll last 30 years and I'm too cheap to toss it and buy another as long as it's working.
2,"Purchased it as a wedding gift for my cousin. Had it shipped to her,  it was received with scratches and a ding on the front. :("
1,It was tiny for the price.
5,Very quite. Can not even hear it run.  The turntable is easy to remove and replace for cleaning. 900 watts is very sufficient for my purposes. Excellent size for countertop.  I recommend this microwave for the price point.
4,"I gave the Noise Level a rating of 3 stars because it is not the oven noise that is loud but rather there is no ""quiet"" way to open or close that door without everyone in the neighborhood knowing you are heating up leftovers ....AGAIN!"
4,"A major issue with the microwave was resolved by chatting with customer service.  (i walked away to get serial number and got disconnected and had to restart chat, but otherwise experience was appropriate and pleasant"
2,"I am returning our microwave. It does not set level and you cannot adjust the legs. I could prop something under the back right leg, but I don't feel that I should have to do that. It is also very light-weight...when I pull the door handle to open the microwave, the whole thing moves! You have to hold the top of the microwave when you open it so it doesn't move. I cannot truly answer the 'noise level' because I never even turned it on."
1,Noisy
2,"Rated at 1000w but not perform anywhere arpt that level and even has declined in performance in 5 months owned. Now,  can I return or get replaced? We’ll see"
5,This works very well for a medium power microwave. It fits well on our counter top. We don’t use it for much more than heating leftovers and occasionally defrost.
4,"No issues in 3-4 months so far, and it's pretty much your basic microwave. Don't cook much with it, so it serves my needs perfectly."
3,It’s kinda loud and really for the wattage struggles to heat as well as the one we replaced. There is no easy to silence the beep. Just thought I was getting more than I got.
5,This item is exactly as described. It’s much better than my old Whirlpool.
3,"This is not actually a review because I didn’t use the product in order to review it properly. (I gave it a middle rating because I had to give something.)When I chose to buy this unit I noticed that there were *others* selling this item too. So I looked and saw that there were a couple of used units. The one I chose said that it was used but that there was only some damage on the exterior box. It was also $30 less expensive. It was also listed under “Amazon.com Services LLC”Of course I felt safe to buy this unit even though it was “used-very good”. I’ve purchased several things from Amazon services/warehouse and have never been disappointed. The first picture shows a dent in the side. It’s minor and won’t affect the use of the unit, kinda what I expected, and could live with. It was going to be tucked into a microwave hole in the wall type arrangement so it wouldn’t show anyway. But!! The control panel was flopping around! It does simply snap-in, which I was surprised to see, so I tried to snap it back in. It wouldn’t stay in, which the second picture shows.I’m fairly sure that it wasn’t damaged in shipping. The exterior of the box was hardly damaged at all. I’m not posting this review to dissuade anyone from buying from Amazon warehouse etc. I’m posting this so that you can add this to your knowledge and use this bit of information in making a future decision. This review also is aimed solely at a person considering buying a *used* item on Amazon, not a new one. I believe I will wind up buying this unit... new."
4,Does the job but the button you press to open does not pop open easily when pressed.
3,"I dislike the fact that I got no full user's manual with the oven. Only got a quick guide and it directs you to get it online or call an 800 number for a printed copy. When I called the number, I was told there are no printed copies of user's manuals available. I think if you purchase an item that has so many different functions, that a full manual print out should arrive in the package."
1,"2 months old, maybe 30 uses.  It is DEAD.  Registering 1500 or so watts (tested with a kill-a-watt tester) and there is a burning smell.  Unit tested ok at first.  To be clear - this is an 1100 watt unit and as i said it tested as such when i first got it. it is now consuming 1.5x that.  Very unsafe.  DO NOT BUY."
5,"I really liked my old microwave but when I was cleaning it and discovered the entire ceiling was a mass of bubbled rust I didn’t hesitate to buy a new one. However when I received this one I hated it. Yes I really did and was preparing to return it but then I got a message that family was coming for Christmas. At this point I had no choice but to use this new microwave. During the next few days most everyone used the microwave several times. I was getting comments from not only the women but also the men and one teen about how easy it is to use, how it’s the perfect size and how quickly the food is cooked or the coffee reheated. How nice looking it is and how good it is that your not bombarded with so much preset options that it confusing. I had a microwave cart across the room and this was where I placed the microwave. My daughter-in-law convinced me that since I used it so often and it was just the right size to fit in a corner on my counter next to the sink that maybe I should move it there. And of course she was right. Now I have found that since it’s right there in front of me I use it much more often than I used it across the room. Most of you probably know how we as humans get attached to something and have a hard time adjusting to changing that. My hatred was premature because the more I use this one the more I love it. I can’t explain the reasons that it’s so much better than the last one but I assure you that it’s an absolute success.Please allow me to give you one tip that I’ve learned the hard way. When you open the door to retrieve whatever your cooking or reheating if there is even the slightest bit of steam leaving the door open for a few minutes to allow it to dry out inside. I believe my mistake with my last microwave was it was allowed time open for the moisture to evaporate. I live on the coast and I feel the only con to living on the water is the moisture. I think between that and moisture being trapped inside is the causes for the rusting. So please extend the life of your microwave.I would definitely recommend this Farberware microwave oven to everyone."
5,WE ARE VEY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHACE.
2,"I think the box it ships it leads it to easily be damaged during shipping. My first one had a broken dish and plastic carousel. There just is not enough padding in the box to protect it. Amazon graciously replaced it for me. However, Toshiba sent me a clearly refurbished item when I purchased new. The panel protective plastic is gone and had lots of scratches, so clearly not a new item, even though they replaced all the tape that try to make it look new. My old microwave had a better plastic material on the panel that doesn't scratch, but the one here is very flimsy and looks to have been flexed during refurbishment."
2,"Microwave function worked great in the beginning. After about 7 months it started glitching and will randomly shut off while using. I have to jiggle the door or open and close it several times to get it to come back on. Air fryer never worked, just makes a loud banging sound like a fan is hitting something. Tried contacting customer support during the warranty period but never got a response."
5,"Hope I am not jinxing myself this microwave is great especially considering the price. I shopped around for microwaves from the Big Box stores and this one, hands down, was the best price. I had a Magic Chef that was still working however the coating from the inside was bubbling and falling off. I have NEVER seen that in all my life and I am a senior citizen! LOL The noise level is what you would expect from a microwave and seriously the clock was easy to set. It is obvious they did not read the manual. DUH!!!!! The LED light is bright and you can easily see in the microwave as it is cooking. I am very pleased with this microwave and I think you will be too! Again hope I am not jinxing myself but I believe this is a good brand of microwave. Fingers crossed."
3,The media could not be loaded.This is a great little microwave except the inside lining is peeling off. I feel this could be an environmental hazard to ones health.
2,"not sure what I didn't already submit this. But the product was weak; took 2 minutes to bring cup coffee to 190F. More significantly, after perhaps cumulative 60 minutes, the gears under the rotary table gave a continuous grinding sound. I seriously doubt it can be traced to shipping abuse, it was well packed, and box had but one small tear new the edge along oven top."
4,"I purchased this because my old microwave was...old, and I wanted something that would match my new stainless steel stove and fridge.  There are many things to love about this appliance--It's much smaller and quieter than my previous behemoth, and unlike many things that claim to be multipurpose, this seems to actually work! The instructions are not all that complicated.  (Can't figure out toast yet...). BUT, while I noted that there were negative comments about the display n the reviews I read, I guess I didn't believe how bad it could be.  Silly me.  The control panel is low contrast-- gray on black-- with ZERO (!!) backlighting.  Believe it.  If you buy this thing, you MUST use a flashlight or its equivalent to see what you are pressing.  if you get used to that, it's a good purchase--although one hopes that that oversight is not indicative of other things that have been left undone and are yet to be discovered."
1,Was broke when I received it. Shipping box was good. Microwave box smashed and product damaged
5,"This is a really nice  microwave. It looks great, just the right size, is powerful and quiet during operation. The silent setting is a nice feature but it makes a pretty loud thunk when closing it which kind of defeats the purpose. Still very happy with it."
4,"The microwave shuts off after about 9 minutes.like it does during defrost - i.e. the fan is going but the actual microwaves stop. My last microwave would go about 11 minutes before this would happen. No big deal as I rarely make anything in a microwave that takes more than 7-8 minutes, but better cooling of the unit would be better (I'm assuming this happens when the electronics hit a certain temperature).The up-side to this is that the fan is very quiet when running compared to my old 900 watt unit. After the warranty expires I might replace the fan with something that moves more air to see if it'll stay on longer.Overall though, I'm happy with it."
5,"Needed a new Microwave quickly after my 10+year old one died and I only had food needing heat to eat. Very inexpensive, arrived fast, controls self-evident. It is smaller than my previous one, and with less cubic it supposedly heats more slowly, but I have not noticed any difference at all. Good price, good size, good quality, perfect for small kitchen, probably dorm, etc."
2,The picture is misleading. The one for the price is not that big
3,The spinning plate sounds like it’s grinding. Definitely not a great product.
2,"Smaller than I thought it would be, only the lower half of the LED readout works, push pad seems to be mis-aligned with the numbers as you have to push several spots around a number to get it to set. Not happy with this product for what it cost."
2,"This microwave died on me today after exactly 18 months of use. It is not a horrible amount of time, but I expected a microwave of this quality to last at least to the 3 year mark. It started arcing for no reason, that we could see, and luckily we were in the kitchen when it happened since it was trying to set itself on fire. It was a little scary since I have never had a microwave die that dramatically before. The microwave was decent while it worked. One the negative side the buttons became harder to press as time went on and the door a bit harder to open. It also was not as powerful as I was hoping, I had to cook everything at least 30-60 secs more than every direction ever said, but I knew I was getting a 900 watt oven so I get it. I did think the interior size was decent all things considering. I just ordered a new microwave today and I purposely did not even look at other Toshiba's. Only 18 months of use is not worth it for me. Hopefully, I will have better luck with my new purchase. If you do buy this microwave ABSOLUTELY buy the 3 year or more warranty for 10 bucks. If you want to get any kind of real use out of this machine, the warranty is a must!"
2,When using this oven with the convection feature the entire unit froze.  It was necessary to unplug the unit and plug it back in.
1,"I purchased the Toshiba Microwave/Convection oven five months ago and since that time the light has blown out and it has gotten loud and makes a loud vibrating noise.  I would like to rrtirn the microwave or take it to a dealer to be repaired.  This microwave is only five 1/2 months old and if you are not going to stand behind the products you sell, the I will no longer use Amazon!  The light burned out and I can't even tell how to change it.  It starts out working fine and then it goes into this vibrating roar!  I can't believe that you are not going to replace and I will make it a point to let all of my friends on face book and see if they will pass the word around that you do not stand behind the products you sell.  I didn't even a book with it!If you don't replace my microwave after only 5 1/2 months I will make sure the word gets out about the way you do business.  I thought Amazon was great, but the first time I've had a problem and you don't want to fix it or replace it  Shame on you!  You know, if this was a cheap item I would have probably forgotten about it, but I'm on a fixed income and my money is precious to me when I can only purchases items like this because mine broke. This will be my last purchase I make. I will pray for you I think you need it!!!!!"
1,"This seemed like a convenient appliance as it is an air fryer, convection oven and microwave. However, the microwave portion does not work. It turns on, rotates, timer works but does not heat. Appliance takes up too much room to just function as an air fryer."
1,Its not worth it this brand is worthless. I have only had this item for less than 3 months and its malefunctioning you cant heat somin longer than 8 min and it over heats and shuts off. And the outside get so hot it will burn ya if you touch it.  I dont have the box or receite so i csnt return it so it looks like i have to soend more and get another. Farberware isnt a good brand ive had other farberware items. Not a good thing
2,"I have had this microwave/air fryer for two months now and all three adults in my house agree that it’s not worth the money I paid for it.  Cooking times on any setting are inconsistent. Sometimes it takes 30 seconds to warm a room temperature cup of coffee and other times it can take up to 2 minutes. The manual that is included is less than useless as it is written in poor English and pictures. The air fryer mode (the main reason why I chose this appliance), is a crap shoot every time since there almost no instruction on how to use it and the results are different each time. It took me longer to air fry a frozen pizza than the oven cooking instructions for the pizza. I have serious buyers remorse about choosing this product. I would return it if I could."
4,"We bought this microwave oven when our 1350 watt Panasonic broke after more than 10 years.  We knew the power output was a lot less, so heating food needed some adjustment.  It's easy math; 2 minutes with the old microwave become 3 minutes, 1 minute becomes 1.5 minutes.  We were happy to find out that because of this low power output, the circuit breaker wouldn't turn off when we had the toaster and the water kettle going at the same time in the kitchen.  We don't have busy mornings nowadays because of COVID-19, but when society is back to normal we should appreciate it more.What we were pleasantly surprised about it is the feature to turn off the beeping sound when the heating is finished.  We never realized that the beeping in the middle of the night was so noisy!  The motor (?) itself is also very, very quiet.  With the old microwave, the TV sound in the adjacent family room had to be turned up when microwave was in use.  No need for that now.We were not super-thrilled about the user interface.  It isn't very intuitive, but everyone got used to it after 2 weeks.  I might have to write an update based on the durability, but for now, all good."
5,This microwave looks great and fits in with a modern kitchen. Works well and seems to be pretty accurate with the wattage it puts out cooking wise. Easy to clean as well.
1,Lasted 2 years with use e every other weekend only. Poor product-fire danger-do not buy!!!
3,"Enjoyed my previous small Panasonic microwave for years. researched this one. The size was great. the ""touch"" key pad is more like a ""push, give a strong poke and poke again the same darn number"" pad. Frustrating, intermittently responsive. Heats unevenly. fairly drastically.The inside of the oven is a dark grey color. Cleans easy, but the dark was a bit of an adjustment. good light inside. same noise as previous which is a 3 or 4 star. Wish it were a bit quieter. The keypad has to be cleared to begin, even if you just opened the door.Doesn't self reset."
1,"I absolutely do NOT recommend this machine. This product was difficult to use from the start. The air fryer function never worked properly and after about 6 months the microwave quit. It was noisy, the cabinet became hot, and it was a general pain in the butt to use.I was buying this after a move to replace a microwave and an air fryer to save counter space in my rental home. Lesson learned.Additionally the ability to return it after it became completely defunct has passed. Shame on Toshiba for obviously planting fake reviews and offering such a limited warranty."
3,Bought this to replace an older GE microwave unit and thought why not a combo unit. I’ve not used the air fryer feature because it flashes HOT when I try popping two bags of popcorn back to back. I’m disappointed and thinking I may need to replace this unit. It’s not 90 days old yet.
4,See headline.
1,After 6 weeks I noticed that sometimes there is a smell like burning plastic or bad wiring. Unfortunately the return window has closed
3,"I gave this microwave a 3 star for three specific reasons, but it otherwise appears to be generally an attractive, solid unit at a reasonable price.The major downer is that the control panel pressure points are a mystery at best. They require too much pressure and the pressure point is not accurately centered. I made the problem livable with a pink eraser. You know, the kind for your kids in school or the office, trapezoid in shape. Anyway, I use it to press the finger area. I have to press a little harder than I would like, but with a bit of usage, I have no problem. It seems to hit the sweet spot without much more effort.Another downer, the ECO mode is nonsense. There are no instructions, no explanation and you can't tell whether it is on or off. I researched it on the internet and my opinion was affirmed.The third was an annoyance. All these companies seem to give lousy internal dimensions. They don't note whether they include the 'curvature' depth/ with or not. Thus the interior on this one was not larger than another because one included the extra space and one didn't. I could get ugly about this but, oh well.I like very much that I can turn on and off the 'finish cooking' ding-ding. But it is fussy and not a simple on/off. I just leave it off. The handle adjustment feature works well, so that's a plus, I guess. It takes a few seconds to adjust, so grab and go isn't encouraged if your life is a whirlwind.Overall, I wouldn't buy this model again despite the good price. It works well enough and fits its location to not be worth the effort to return and do more research. On the other hand, I expect I will replace it within a year or two whether it needs it or not.Good Luck!"
1,"I purchased this microwave 11 months ago. I was doing my routine cleaning with vinegar and water and noticed the bubbled look on the interior top of the unit. 90% of the time we use our food cover to prevent splatters and keep it cleaner. I thought my boyfriend had exploded something and left it. Well come to find out it was nothing but bubbled paint and rust underneath when I tried to wipe it clean. I was disgusted, angry and disappointed to say the least!! I had to go and buy another microwave because it obviously is unuseable in this condition. Thank God I caught it when I did or there could have been a disaster. $100 microwaves should not do this when the up-keep was done on it. I was expecting years out of this purchase. I should have purchased the warranty but did not due to the fact that the reviews I read were better than other brands I had looked at. Well I was fooled I guess. No more Faberware brand for me!!"
3,LIKE THE LOOKS DID NOT LIKE THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS MICROWAVE IT STARTED TO WEAR ON THE INSIDE  SURPRISE I THOUGHT THIS UNIT WOULD LAST A LOT LONGER IT HAD ONLY BEEN LESS THAN 4 YEARS
5,"After a mother-in-law induced disaster, we found ourselves in need of a new microwave.We have minimal counter space and found this would fit our need perfectly, especially with height to fit underneath our top cabinets. The downside is the capacity inside won't accomodate heating large dishes. It does heat extremely well in a short amount of time.It is sleek in appearance and matches well with our stainless steel appliances.I was attracted to the inclusion of the air fryer function, as our air fryer was recently recalled. To use the air fryer you need a metal rack and a special pan. Since the microwave is on the smaller side, the rack and pan aren't big enough to do large air fryer meals. But, if you want to pop in some french fries or nuggets, something small, then this is great! I love that my kids could use that feature without needing to risk using the oven. Another downside is finding somewhere to conveniently store the needed accessories.I rated a little lower on the noise level, it has some loud and long beeps I find annoying. For example, I heated a meal and when it was done, I removed it. Our past microwaves just did that said and done, but at least in this instance, the microwave beeped at me until I returned to cancel the job.The fan is also a bit loud, but to be expected with the air fryer needing to cool down.I like that I can easily control the power levels. I find a lot of items indicate what power level to use and frankly I've never been able to navigate that on previous appliances.Overall we are very happy with this purchase."
5,"Heats food up well. I really like the silent mode, great for early morning or late night tea/coffee/meals."
2,"Turntable motor broke less than 60 days after purchasing. Has clicked since day 1, but today sounds like it's going to explode. Can not use turntable at all. Disappointed."
3,"It looks fine, works ok so far.  I just got it so need more time, BUT, it is SO DARK!  I have had and ued a lot of microwaves, and i have never seen one this dark.  It looks like it is lit by a match instead of a light and I have NEVER heard a microwave make so much noise.  It is extremely LOUD.  For those two reasona lone, i would NOT purchase again nor recommend."
1,"The turntable is sticking, moves a little then jumps and is making horrible noise after 1 week of use.  Seems there is something falling off underneath.  I expect the function to completely break in a little while.  I mainly use for defrosting so not to big of a deal, but quality of item is just not there!"
5,"Love the size. We don't use microwave often enough to occupy large portion of counter space. So this is perfect. Our previous one of the same size, different manufacturer broke down after numerous years."
2,I guess other reviewers have gotten used the controls but I find them annoying. It’s a very weak microwave but the controls are my biggest gripe. Don’t buy this for an elderly person or they will go hungry
3,It's ok but for some reason using this microwave requires more heat up time than normal.
5,"Like: Ease of use, quality, durability & power.I used this product (Farberwave Microwave Oven) much better than conventional oven to prepare meals less time."
1,The door wouldn't open 😣 didn't realize this until my husband had threw away the box.
2,I expected food to take longer with smaller wattage but did not expect it to tip forward every time we open the door!  Also every time we remove an item the turntable comes out of the grooves that hold it in place. Very shabby workmanship. I guess I expected more from Farberware and the price.  Would not buy again.
3,"Very small, and not as powerful as I expected it to be."
5,Well made and functional. Works well. I would purchase again. Nice and small and does not take up too much counter space.
2,It was working fine for a couple days until the time display n light on the inside started to be flashing lights...I'm like omg unplug it before it explodes!...so I cant get my money back but that's ok...life goes on
3,"I needed a new ME. Wanted something simple. This had good reviews. Small. Affordable. Great. Got it. Worked fine by choosing minutes snd start.  Then it didn’t. Followed book instructions-time, minutes, power, start. Great. Worked. NOW no matter what I choose, power will not come in!  Just counts down like a timer.  Totally frustrated and ready to dig box out of trash and return!"
3,"If you need a black trim kit for this product, don’t expect Panasonic to have one. Also, don’t expect them to assist you in getting one."
5,Works great. Love that I have extra space on my counter . It is lower wattage so I add an extra minute or 2 to whatever I'm heating.
3,"We got this microwave today.  After unpacking and setting up, I noticed the control panel is hard to see unless you are almost nose-to-nose or looking at it from a diagonal  angle.  The light white lettering against a pale grey background is very hard to see.  The lettering should have been, for example, white against a black background for maximum visibility.  I am really surprised that Panasonic either didn't customer test this feature, or if they did, they ignored it as it is OBVIOUS.  I would request they create a upgrade accessory that would fit over the existing space to correct this issue.  Very disappointed as this is the primary contact area you have with the microwave.Other features worked OK."
4,"I was really surprised when I got this item delivered as it's very big and I wasn't expecting that. I should've checked the specs and registered that in my mind upon purchase, but I didn't. I initially read all the comments and saw many calling it compact or small and got that impression.Well it's definitely not small. It's a huge microwave. Aside from the size I like it and haven't had any issues. It's very powerful it feels like heats food up in an instant and currently feels pretty stable, haven't had any bugs. Also the color is really nice and the overall look, it's spacious enough inside and has a lot of good qualities. I've had no issues with the product aside from the size, it's just not great for compact spaces. Maybe some of the people who said it's compact have huge spaces or homes but for me I live in a compact space in an apartment and this currently rests on my kitchen table and it takes up half of the table space."
2,Oven arrived smashed and damaged at 3 locations.
5,"This is a great quality microwave and heats food very nicely, its small compact size is great for apartments with limited space and small kitchens. Its very easy to use and clean when needed. The silver stainless and black design matches any kitchen color theme and is perfect."
1,"It was an okay microwave. However, it lasted the shortest amount of time a microwave has ever lasted for me. Only a year and a half before stopping completely. Would not recommend."
5,"Still learning how to use this unit so far so good,microwave is fabulous, oven air fry is convenient ."
1,"Too large, should have read outside measurements"
3,"Seems like a nice unit, but the front was damaged in delivery"
4,"The machine is a little more complicated than the older model, but I will get used to it."
2,"but too many issues.  The first was the control panel, you can't see it.  The panel is not lit and it is black!  I had to use a flashlight to see what I was doing.  The air fryer was sub par and so was the convection feature.Sadly, it was returned."
3,I like the crisping feature I just wish it had come with everything it was supposed to.
4,So far so good. It's a bit cheaply made - but it works to heat up beverages or food. I wouldn't do anything substantial in this as it's just convenient for warming up.
4,"The media could not be loaded.Very pretty. But sooo loud! Why does a microwave need to beep 5X at the end!?! Imagine, kids are asleep and mom and dad are sneaking popcorn… not with this loud ol’ thing. Buttons are loud to press and it rattles a little."
3,"kNOW ITS FOR SAFTY BUT HAVE PROBLEMS WITH OPENING DOOR, AM OLDER & HANDS HARD TO MOVE DOOR OPEN"
1,"On its 3rd use, my wife was popping popcorn in the microwave and we heard an explosion after maybe 20 seconds of starting it. The turntable had cracked in half. Never seen this happen before in my entire life. Amazon was no help at all, they wanted me to contact the manufacturer or maybe give me $20. I just wanted a microwave that worked properly after my other one went out. Now I guess it’s a trip to Walmart. I am sending it back for a refund. Maybe they’ll give me my money back. I’m just about done with Prime and the whole Amazon company. They’re not the same company they were."
5,"I have a home but recently got an apartment about 3 hours away. The kitchen area is very small and it did not come with a microwave. I knew I wouldn't have room for both a microwave and a toaster oven but I wasn't sure how I could live without either so I Googled if they made a combination and BAM! Not only does it look sleek from the outside but the led lit inside is also very nice! I wish the keypad was back-lit but that's a minor con. I also wish it was a little easier to use right out of the box but when you have a multi tool I guess it's not always so straight forward. I've used it for 2 weeks now and I keep the manual nearby incase I have to check back on how to use an option but I'm starting to do it on my own without looking at the steps for each option. It seems a little less powerful than my toaster oven at home but I can't complain because it looks better and saves space! Just remember, no metal in the microwave but must use the grill rack for anything else! Haha"
4,I love that I can do so many things in one oven.  I dislike how dirty it gets.
4,"Great microwave! Love the color inside and out. The lighting on the inside is awesome! It’s very big on the inside as well so fits just about any dish size. The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because it was delivered with a broken handle. The handle to microwave door was completely off. Instead of sending it back and what not during this pandemic, I used superglue and made an easy fix. You can hardly tell. Other than that, I love it!"
5,"so far this has been exactly what we wanted.  it fits in small spaces and does its job well.  I have one minor gripe-- those damned ""your stuff's done"" beeps.there should be a federal law stating that microwavesust have the ability to silence all beeping.  if you try to use the thing while your sigoth is on a work call, guess what?  it beeps with every single button press.  forget to stop it at 0:01?  get ready for 27 beeps!  (okay, I think it's five beeps, whatever.)"
5,"This is our second microwave (same model!).  We kept the new one, and gave our not-so-old one to our friend.  These microwaves are great!  They are big enough to accommodatemy large platter when I am defrosting many pieces of chicken, or a family size frozen pizza.  When cooking on a selected power level, it cooks without making the edges rock-hard!  Panasonic has the patent on this technology."
2,It pulls  over 300 more watts than stated.  1000 +  vs 700 watts on the label.
2,"I've had this microwave for only a year and the last 6 months it just stopped heating efficiently. warming food took longer and longer until I finally had to replace it. It is small and compact on the countertop which is nice, but it won't fit anything too tall, which limits what you can put in there.  Like a tall canning jar or container.  All in all, wish i would have purchased insurance on this one since it only lasted 6 months. Such a bummer"
4,It really does well on thawing frozen food and works really good on heating up things fast. But the light is pretty bad in it. Kinda makes it look cheap and it is really loud. Thank goodness it heats food fast.
4,"This went into a space with not a hair to spare. I knew nothing about the product but since having it it's fine so far, I totally recommend it."
4,"For a small microwave, it gets the job done. We needed this in a pinch when our larger microwave quit working and perhaps we're a bit spoiled from that. I miss some of the features we had like the option to add time with the push of a button (add 30 sec) when we could tell our food needed more time (like when popping popcorn). But like I said, for a small model, it works and is a good model for the price. We can fit a full size plate or bag of popcorn inside and it has a rotating tray inside for more even cooking. It has preset buttons like ""popcorn"" but I've found it's easier just to input time and monitor what you're cooking. I do most of the cooking and reheating and I don't mind using it, but my husband can't wait to upgrade to a larger model soon."
3,Good microwave but it's small.  My dinner plate doesn't fit in the microwave for reheating but it works good otherwise
2,the amount of times it dings (3) I find a little irritating once is enough
5,I like that it's easy to clean and easy to prepare a meal.
1,No revido microwave este dia
2,I should have gotten a larger oven. This one is much smaller than I like.
1,"The media could not be loaded.Thought I would love this microwave with all great features. Looking forward to using. Received and set up. Used it and see a lot of smoke inside. Opened the unit and all came out the door. Called customer service to replace, thinking unit was broken and needed a new one. Received 2nd unit and same issue. This is a poor design and my opinion, fire hazard. Now I have to send this back and find a different brand to buy. Very disappointed."
3,This microwave is very loud. It works but it’s crazy how loud it is.
1,"We have bought two of these, mostly because the depth is shallow and fits in a space we have for it. The first one works fairly well for a year. The door is super loud and wakes people up who are upstairs and at the other end of 6000sq ft house. The first one died after 15 months. We bought another one this week and it was dead on arrival: never functioned once. Look around for the error code that happens to everyone who buys one of these. You are all on borrowed time."
2,"This is a follow-up review.  After less than six months of exceedingly light use, this oven trips the GFI and circuit breaker.  We have tried five different outlets with the same result and in different locations.  In each instance, it is the only appliance on the circuit.  Back at the original circuit, we tried a blender, a toaster, and a vacuum cleaner and none of them tripped the circuit.  Now for the maddening part.  There is no phone number for contacting Panasonic where you can speak with a human being.  The number provided says their support center is closed due to Covid 19 (where other manufacturers have their folk providing support safely from home).  It is impossible to find a repair center or even to figure out how to request/obtain repair authorization.  Finally I found a link to request warranty service and submitted it.  We'll see just how long that takes and what it is I will have to pay, even in this supposed warranty period.  There does not appear to be any in-home service available.  On reflection, I think we should have purchased a GE product.  Next time...or if I trash this otherwise nice appliance."
5,had to return it
4,"Functions easily and perfectly. Nice size but needs several inches behind it which takes up more counter space than it looks like it would. And yes, it’s noisier than some; you get used to it and it’s a terrific little work horse."
3,It’s so light that when you push a control button it moves the thing further back on the shelf. Lol.
2,"I had a Toshiba Microwave for more than 30 years so I thought it was a safe choice to buy another.  This one seemed great at first – much faster than the old one with more features.  But soon I started noticing occasional quirks where it just wouldn’t cook at full power.  Ie: you could press 4 which should be 4 minutes at full power, but you could hear it cycling on and off and pressing power displayed that it was cooking at power level 8.  I tried various theories to try to reliably get power level 10, but never found a consistent way.Even explicitly setting the cook time and the power level didn’t work as the microwave would simply replace your choice with its choice once the cooking cycle began.  This happens with manual cooking as well as memory presets.  One day, you can use memory 1 to slow coat some oatmeal, but another day, you’ll come back to a cold bowl of oats and water.  Run memory 1 again and it may or may not cook on the second time.  Two days ago, after 3 memory 1 cycles in a row failed, I transferred the oats to the range.  The next day, memory 1 worked the first time.  Today it did not.  Today it struggled to even get 50ml of water to boil at “full power” (which wasn’t full because it was cycling).  Tomorrow, who knows?It has a few other surprising quirks as well.  The buttons under the panel are a little flakey and you have to hit some of them a little off-center  (vs the labels) to activate them.  The “5” is especially hard to reliably activate.  Amazing that simple things like this worked fine on the 30-year-old model.On the plus side, it is lighter, cheaper, and more powerful (when it decides to run in full power) but the 30-year-old one didn’t have to be watched all the time to see if it was actually cooking as set."
2,"When I received it in the mail, I took it out of the box and the microwave was dented on the side. In addition, after couple of uses the numbers on the key pad got worn down quickly."
3,Used pretty much for the usual
4,"Pretty good microwave overall. Powerful, heats pretty evenly. Alexa integration through their app initially worked like a charm, then randomly stopped working - apparently this is a known issue without a solution according to some out there. But then a minor miracle happened - we had a power outage at the house that lasted a couple of hours, and afterwards Alexa was able to control the microwave again! This feature comes in more handy than I thought it would, so I was glad to see this functionality work again."
5,Works as described. Warms food like it should
4,"So far we really like this oven, but when we received it the ring assembly was cracked because everything inside the oven was not secured and all. I was surprised the glass tray wasn’t broken too. I can’t see where I can let the company know so they can send me a replacement. I glued it together and so far it’s holding."
1,"The microwave is ok, but it is NOT a good Alexa enabled device.  I was able to get it connected using the confused and inadequate directs and faulty sternal app.  It worked ok for a total of three days.  Suddenly, Alexa said the microwave wasn’t conceded to wifi or didn’t have power, even though the iPhone app clearly showed it and was able to communicate with it and operate it.  It was sold as an Alexa enabled device.  It is ENTIRELY dependent on a skill that seems to have more bugs than an overused backyard zapper.  Now it is ONLY a generic microwave and, since I was trusting enough I threw out the box. Otherwise, this would be headed back to Amazon for refund.  If you an an overpriced microwave, get it.  Want Alexa integration, look elsewhere.  This device and its associated apps and skills are SORELY lacking."
3,"I have absolutely no idea why, but every time I close the door on this microwave, I get a long beep followed by some sort of hard reset that clears the clock. This started happening about a month after I bought it.As a microwave, it works great. The controls are rather unintuitive though. Most of the functions are coded and I actually needed the manual to figure out how to use the auto defrost feature. You get DEF1 if you press it and DEF2 if you press it again. You'll need the manual to tell you what that even means and what to do next.It is easy to keep clean because it's dark grey inside, which is nice. I just wish it didn't reset every time I close the door."
5,Microwave has a great look fits in the Kitchen and has a great deal of power!
3,It’s too small. I bought it for popcorn but the microwave popcorn bag is too big and it doesn’t work properly. Very frustrating.
2,Have tried to use convection oven and outside of all items cooked were burned and center left raw. Have still not figured out air fryer mode.  Have read all in-line manuals and watched multiple videos and still can't get what I need out of this device.  Not worth the money. But a great microwave
3,Very loud and noisy while running.
5,"Very good Microwave powerful and fast just the right amount of settings The new one is almost exactly the same as the one it replaced the only change I see is the quick minute is now the quick 30 seconds and that was needed I think ,,, By the way the last 1250 watt  inverter Panasonic microwave lasted 18 years and never missed a beat Ya cant beat that The only thing on the down side is the price but you get what you pay for."
1,The door latch broke after a couple months
2,"We bought this microwave two years ago and chose this make/model due to the rather compact space we were trying to fit it into.  Unfortunately, we have not been particularly happy with it.  The controls, specifically regarding the use of a power level other than ‘high’ are rather non-intuitive…just not a real great button/programming design.  Interestingly, the microwave also does not come with a kitchen-timer feature like most do.  The most recent disappointment is that the hard-wired light bulb inside the microwave is failing, resulting in a rather unnerving flickering/flashing light while the microwave is in use.  Presumably, the light will stop working entirely in a week or two.  The bulb cannot be replaced without a service tech visit, and alas, it only has a 1 year manufacturer’s warranty on it.  Probably would avoid this make/model if you can."
1,It's nice but the face plate  broke when I got it
5,"Just received it Saturday and LOVE IT. I replaced a “higher end” (more expensive) Cusinart microwave / convection oven that did not make it two years. The Cusinart worked great...  Until the Push Button Door opener broke. I tried to fix the Cusinart door release button but to no avail.I selected this Toshiba based on the unit specs, User Ratings and that the door is opened with a simple pull handle (no complex plastic parts to break leaving you locked out of your microwave).We have used this Toshiba microwave numerous times over the last three days. It is very, very quite and, it heats up items about 40% faster than the Cusinart. For instance, it would take the Cusinart 2.5 minutes to heat my cold cup of coffee in the morning. This Toshiba gets the same amount of coffee hotter in 1.5 minutes. Heating oatmeal was the same. This Toshiba worked way faster.I have not yet used the convection component but I am confident that it will perform at least as well!Lastly, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this microwave!  Very, very well made!Oh yeah, and this Toshiba microwave was more than a hundred dollars less than my defunct Cusinart!"
3,Very few preset timers (popcorn) also the metal bottom was dented and I doubt it was from shipping. I think that it was shipped that way. other than that. it works well but you just need to feel it out
2,This can’t be safe. Inside enamel cooking off and rust is underneath. Although this didn’t start until after about 2 yrs of use I feel this should have never happened.
2,"I am extremely disappointed in this microwave. The main issue is the turntable design in which the glass so easily slips from the rotator motor and ring wheels. When I slide about anything onto the glass, the slight moment will push the glass right off! So frustrating! My 15 year old Sharp microwave never did that but for extreme cases.The microwave also started arcing at random with things like popcorn, butter, or other low moisture items. Thankfully, they are on-point with their warranty service. They use Midea to process the claims."
4,This little microwave is the best! I have limited counter space and wanted a smaller microwave and this fit the bill perfectly. It is still big enough to re-heat a full size dinner plate. The clock was easier to set but I did only give 4 stars for 'easy to use' because I struggled a bit to figure out the various settings. It is not as intuitive as most microwaves BUT not a deal breaker and more likely the problem was my learning curve. If you are looking for a space saver this is a great choice.
5,No issues at all.Better than the last one
2,"Had this for 2 months now, lightly used, makes a horrible grinding sound when the tray rotates. Loud enough that you hear it on the second floor."
1,Bought last year in July and it broke. Waste of money
2,"This microwave is extremely powerful and too powerful for most food.  I constantly need to reduce the power setting to cook or reheat.  When user the ""sensor reheat"", it will never stop before the food is overheated (even when I use the ""less"" button).  I put oatmeal in a microwave safe bowl for one minute and it cracked the bowl and oatmeal overflowed.  If i use the power button at a lower setting it works fine but has to be watched constantly or things explode.  I wouldn't recommend this unit unless you need a LOT of power.  For me it doesn't work that well."
4,"small built in space-needed a specific size and depth-perfect. V easy to use, no unnecessary bells or whistles."
5,Only 700 watts.  So I need to cook longer.Small microwave is still working fine 🙂
2,"I have a lot of Black & Decker products, this one is a let down. Cooking power is good for a small unit but there are some design flaws that really downgrade it. First, the release button for the door is so stiff the microwave slides across the counter when we try to open the door. We have to hold the microwave in place with one hand while pressing the button with the other. The release knob makes a horrible screeching sound as well. the touch pad is hard to read unless it is at eye level, if you are placing on a countertop, be prepared to bend over frequently. The plug isn't flat but sticks out from the outlet about 2 inches so if you have it directly in front of the outlet you cant go back against the wall. honestly, I wish I had returned it."
5,Bought this for my mom because it was hands down the best deal in stores or online because there was no taxes added! Amazon has truly been a savings blessing to me and my entire family. Microwave evenly heats food and distributes enough heat to cook foods thoroughly-couldn't be more pleased.
1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, this thing is useless.  I was lured by its redness and cuteness but the directions are written by Martians and are impossible to figure out. The turntable acts like it was made for a different item all together; it doesn't fit at ALL. So unless you just want it to sit there looking cute and small and red and warm things in 30 sec increments, SAVE YOUR MONEY."
4,Heats food fine. Never used the broiler feature. The door closure is very loud. It literally closes with a bang. I would not buy this model again
5,This is the most quiet microwave I've ever owned.  Works well and has many functions that I have used.  It is smaller inside than they advertised.
5,Nice comes with the Genius system and provides 15 or so built-in food selections for specific foods. Plus you have a 30 second add if needed. Overall best Microwave I have ever owned.
4,Hello just noting this product came dented in the back- seems to be working fine but documenting it here just in case there is an issue
1,"Update March 2022:The Alexa skill has stopped functioning repeatedly. I was able to get it working again a couple of times (can't remember exactly what I did), but now it doesn't work (again). I can't figure out a fix. I've tried rebooting the router, unplugging the microwave and plugging it back in, disabling the skill and re-enabling it, etc. The app sees the microwave, but Alexa cannot control it. She either says ""I'm not sure what went wrong"" or she says ""microwave isn't responding."" So frustrating, as this is why I bought this particular microwave. My husband is central-vision blind. Now every time he wants to microwave something, I have to do it for him. Not cool Toshiba!!!Original review:The microwave function options seem just fine, and the full size is good for fitting most cookware and dishes. My issue with this is the very difficult job of getting it working with the WIFI and with Alexa. I spent about an hour fiddling around with it and trying different things. I almost gave up and was planning on packaging it up and returning it. But I decided to persevere and FINALLY got it connected and functioning. This was vital to me, as my husband is visually impaired. I had to have the voice operation. Now that voice control is working, I like the microwave. I just hope and pray I don't lose connection in the future and have to go through that awful task again. Fingers crossed! If I have connection issues, I will come back here and report my troubles.I love how fluffy my popcorn is turning out in this microwave! My old microwave was a very tiny 700 watt unit and did a terrible job with popcorn. It wouldn't fluff up and there were lots of kernels left over. But this new Toshiba microwave, with its higher wattage, does an excellent job with popcorn! I am also enjoying the reheat function which uses steam to automatically calculate the right time. It seems to be working quite well. The oven fits nicely into my pantry."
3,Happy with everythying except that it heats unevenly. The top of food is scalding hot while the bottom is barely warm.
3,Don’t buy! Door doesn’t close properly. Cheap.
1,"After taxes it was almost $70 bucks too expensive to be so small.. and it also got extremely hot , in the middle of cooking popcorn it turned completely off and had to cool off completely before operating again!"
5,"I needed a very small microwave because I have very limited counter space in my kitchen. I normally just use microwaves to re-heat food or maybe melt chocolate for a recipe. It won't hold a regular size dinner plate, but I already knew that and I didn't care. FYI: an added note inside the microwave said ""do not use without the rotating glass piece."" Aesthetically, it's pretty nice, too."
1,It is small for us
1,I am beyond upset that less than a year this microwave has broken. Can it be replaced?
5,"Lots of good things are being said about this microwave, and I have to agree. There's a bit of a learning curve with the cook times to avoid undercooking or overheating my food. But after a little trial and error, it's been smooth sailing with this Toshiba. It's dependable and has become a trusty appliance in my kitchen."
2,"Does this microwave work? Yeah. Like a person at 5pm on a Friday night. Granted, I paid $50 for it so wasn't expecting the moon, but I'm surprised at how long it takes to do its business.My other criticism has nothing to do with its underwhelming performance, but is rather cosmetic in nature. I really dislike the company's name on the door. I don't like the name itself, don't like the spelling, don't like the weird, misplaced apostrophe at the end, and I really don't like the third grade birthday party invitation font. It looks cheap. I mean, it was cheap, so what did I expect? But still, I don't like it.Overall, I can't really recommend this microwave unless cost is your number one criteria, but even then, it's probably worth it to scrounge up a few extra bucks and get something better. I'm sending this back and bought a 1000W microwave on a warehouse deal for $86 instead."
1,Microwave frame was tweaked and it would not sit right on counter. Would have been unsafe to use.  Really looked forward to using it. Opened it Christmas day and it rocked back and forth on the counter because it was not built right. Box looked Ok so it had to be damage when made. Looks like it had been repackaged too so maybe someone else returned it also. Will buy another locally so we can inspect it before accepting delivery. UPS has it now but we have to wait for Amazon to process it when they get it back before getting the credit for it.
5,works as expected. easy to set up and get it going. no issues.
3,I like that there are minutes in a gray box as I am low vision I do not like that the plate is part of the gears The turn it and that has to be placed properly Diffi wcult for a little vision person
2,The sound this unit produces is very annoying.
3,"I really liked it. It was compact and did it's job well especially for the price. That said, it lasted 3 years. Bought on Nov 29, 2019 and died in Dec 5, 2022 so I gave it 3 stars."
2,"I was perfectly happy with this, but I think it should have lasted longer than 3 years. June 2020 - June 2023"
1,"This piece of junk died after less than a year, it started to spin the turn table and microwave when a person opened the door, and it stopped heating food.  Into the recycling it went, aka Goodwill, as they'll take broken appliances/electronics."
1,"I would pay a hundred dollars to trade this for my 15 year old Panasonic microwave if it still worked.The entire display is in soft gray on a medium gray surface.  IMPOSSIBLE to read anything without looking from the side or shining a light on it.  I put a dab of fingernail polish on the ""2"" as a point of reference!What genius decided to make everything a secret?The sensor level instructions make it so complicated, I've reverted to the old method and hope for the best.I may just donate this thing and start over."
4,"I just received it over the weekend set it up on my open counter to meet the distance requirements for height, etc. Needs to be away from heat.The interior is a dark grey and it's a good size. I've used it to make cream of wheat and warm coffee and the timer ⏳"
4,"My built in microwave stopped working and we needed a quick replacement. Having read the reviews we chose this one. I'm not over the moon but it works well. The buttons are difficult to press and to keep the microwave in place, without sliding around i had to purchase a thick mat to put beneath it. I also wish the end of cooking had a repeat beep if you miss the first one!"
4,Works well I just use it in our kitchen downstairs in the rec. room
1,"The obnoxious beeping (both volume & tone) is annoying; I dislike how many buttons need to be pushed to get it to simply turn on for a quick amount of time. After <1mth the door will not open w/o 1 hand prying while the other hand holds down the 'open door' button. I can't seem to get any answers via Panasonic website or customer service hotline. Even though the product is ugly, I bought it because the reviews were higher than other cheaply priced similar products; I regret this purchase."
5,Works well and looks great. I was able to purchase on a monthly payment plan.  Would purchase again.
3,"As far as using the microwave for reheating, etc that part has been fine. The latch is sticking when you push the button to open the door. I read in reviews about it happening but was hopeful when i purchased the microwave i would not have a sticking latch. Seems to be Black and Decker should be fixing the problem. I will say that Amazons customer service but super with helping me."
4,"Once you know how to work it, it's easy...  absolutely only issue is that every fingertip mark on the outside shows, no matter how clean your hands are.  Purchased a black model, seems like I'm always cleaning it.  Had I purchased a stainless finish, I would likely have been posting 5 stars all the way across."
1,Did not work right out of the battered up box
1,"The media could not be loaded.The microwave I recently purchased is not working properly.  It seems like every time I try to use it, something goes wrong.  The controls are so confusing that I can never figure out how to use it properly.But even when I do manage to get it running, the results are often disappointing. The as you can see in the video, the panel stopped at 36 sec and started intermittent lighting and no working anymore. Was the second time we used it after received 4 days ago."
5,"After I lost all patience with a name brand microwave that I bought 9 months earlier, I decided to buy this Toshiba with Alexa integration. WOW! what a difference. Compared to the one I got rid of (that cost more), this Toshiba is quiet, has a handle, inside light, easy to read numbers and many wonderful shortcut features.It was like going from something made during horse and buggy times to something made this century. I am totally pleased with this microwave. Great job, Toshiba.I have no affiliation with Toshiba or the seller. This is an honest review that I was NOT paid to write or asked to write. I paid full price."
1,The microwave won’t heat food anymore.
4,It works and it heats up my food which is awesome.Only downside is that i can’t push the time i want. For example: if i wasn’t 2 mins 15 seconds it won’t let me. I can only do increments of 30 seconds :(
4,"Good value and surprisingly works well for Grandma for her occasional reheat  use. Not packaged well, when received was worried we would have problems (thankfully didn’t) and assume this was a return and they just shipped back out the way it was returned?"
1,"The microwave looked stylish and compact. However, when we close the microwave door, it makes a very loud noise that can easily startle or wake up a sleeping person! I wasn’t sure if it is normal for this brand or if it is some manufacturing defect.We immediately returned it for a refund."
3,"It is a great, expensive microwave and the combination oven- microwave setting is good for reheating foods.When we cooked a pizza in it, we baked it for longer than the pizza box said, and the middle was cold while the edges were almost burned."
1,This is garbage. It clicks when it turns... Horrible to clean because of the grill part screwed to the top and I've barely had it a few months but Amazon says my return window is closed... So I overpaid for it... Not even a year old and I'm stuck with it? Walmart would take it back if I'd bought it there =(
4,"First of all this microwave is HUGE!!!  LOL  I bought it for my daughter and she & her family all love it except for one thing...  Every time someone uses the microwave it interrupts the wifi signal through the house!  They are used to it by now, but it's still a pain. That's why I took off one star.As for the microwave itself, it works perfectly - and they've been using it for over a year.Other than the wifi issue, I would definitely recommend this item."
5,Geez this thing nukes my food so good
1,"This microwave is very weak. At the max power level it takes forever to cook something. Ex. Tried to cook a Trader Joe’s frozen meal that said cook on high for 4 min. It took at least 10-15min and was just luke warm. This seems abnormal for a microwave. Also there is something wrong with the design for the grip that holds the glass plate in place on the turntable. No matter how you fidget with it, it comes off the track almost every time. So you have just like your plate randomly in there off the track which makes the spin feature useless or causes spills. I feel like the last one of these I bought had zero problems. Now it’s just a crappy small microwave. You could breathe heavily on something and heat it faster."
3,"UPDATE: I returned the DOA unit and quickly received a replacement (thanks Amazon). Second one worked out of the box.Seems decent. Glass disk seems noisy/wobbly. Noticeably more than the microwave this unit replaced. And the User Interface is odd. To enter anything other than 30s, 1, 2, 3 minutes (etc.), you have to push the ""clock set"" button twice. First time goes into clock set mode, second time lets you manually set cook time like ""2:45"". Seems a dumb place to bury a frequently used feature. I guess they expect everybody to tie this microwave in with their Alexa/Amazon account and verbally set cook times. I wasn't planning on doing that, but may, since the touch UI is so odd.---Original revivew---Microwave was dead right out-of-the box. No power. Lugged it all over the kitchen trying 4 different plugs to make sure I wasn't being an idiot. Nope. It was DOA. Also, I didn't find that out until I had already enlarged the hole in my cabinet for the enormous plug end to fit through. Not impressed. Returning and will try one more time. After that, the Toshiba brand is gonna be off my list. Will update my review if the next one actually turns on."
2,Haven’t had it for a few months before it broke
3,Radiation beeper goes off if you are only 3 feet away.My old Microwave radiation area was 4 feet away before you got a beep.
2,I bought a more expen=sive model cuz I wanted more levels of use. I got ripped off . And the manuel does not explain a whole awful lot. I moarn my last Panasonic microwave...…..it was far better. It also lasted 11 years. I seriously doubt this one will make it that far.
5,"*update* old Faithful finally made its last bag of popcorn. We had a good 5 years together.I purchased this microwave about 3-4 years ago.I had barely 2 pennies to rub together after leaving an abusive marriage.This microwave has survived 2 toddler aged kids learning how to make popcorn with adult supervision (1st incident 2 years ago. 2nd incident 5 days ago).It's survived my ex throwing it across the room (Yes, even the plate is still perfectly fine)It fit perfectly in the small space I had in my apartment and now sits proudly on my kitchen counter in my house. I can't bare to upgrade because there is no need to.Worth the money."
5,Attractive and large size. Works great!!!
2,This microwave is very complicated to use and I don't like it. If you want to reheat something you have to know how much it weighs then if you're not correct it gets overheated. My old Panasonic was excellent. This item has pages and pages up instructions. I'm planning to return it if I can.
3,"The media could not be loaded.After a week start to make knocking when plate turns, just saw other reviews saying the same thing happend to them and no help from the manufacture or vendor,Wish they can fix this I don't want to go triugh the hassle and return,Seems like the issue maybe just that the notchs on the plate have too much plate allowing the movement"
5,"I used microwave in the past but never own one as I do not feel I really need one.Need force by my girlfriend to get one…..I bought this and happy to have it.1.1 Cube size is larger then I thought but the good size for meI only use it when I need to, still not using it everyday.Good product though"
2,the microwave makes electronic noises when its running
3,"I bought this Microwave in November of last year. It is now September and we are having issues with it. I've never really got a hang of all those many settings and ways to cook on it. Now, when you put in one minute and thirty seconds it takes it as one hour and thirty minutes. A little disappointed in this microwave but plan to unplug it to see if it resets itself."
4,Was exactly what I expected.
2,"Got this 2020. Worked great for the time I had it. Today it just stopped heating food suddenly and the outside is all burning hot with plastic smells. Very scary, did some google searches and it’s likely a failed inverter and I didn’t get the extra warranty because I never had a mircowave fail on me on such a quick turnaround. Maybe just bad luck?"
5,Got this for my grandfather who is in a wheelchair and was having trouble standing to reach his microwave which is mounted over the stove. He loves this one and it improved the quality of his day immediately. Fit nicely on his counter where he can reach it.
5,"It's a microwave! It's an air fryer! It's a combination microwave and air fryer!So far after using this for a month my household loves this as a microwave. It is powerful and easy to use and the silver color matches all of my appliances. The other features- convection heating, air frying and combination air fry/convection at the same time we have only used a handful of times but they work!Is it faster than a traditional air fryer? No absolutely not. It still has to preheat and you have to use a special pan and the microwave beeps at you a lot to warn you that the pan is hot. But does it work? In my opinion yes! I haven't used it to air fry a whole chicken or raw meat but for reheating leftovers and making them crispy it works pretty well.Did this replace my air fryer though? Weirdly enough yes. Despite what I just said I realized that I just don't use my air fryer as often as I would need to to justify having both these items on my counter. I will take having the extra two steps of having to put a wire rack and a special pan into the microwave if it saves me that much counter space."
4,"My kids got me an 8 in 1 type for Xmas but it was too high wattage for my apartment. So we returned it and I picked out this one. Very stylish, noise level is much lower compared to the other one. Fairly easy to operate, it didn't come with instructions, I had to download and print myself and I do keep them handy. The more I use it, the more I remember how! I really wanted a toaster oven type, I can bake or broil, it just takes longer than a toaster would. I do like only having one unit on my counter instead of 2!"
1,"I have had trouble finding a microwave this exact size in the 200.00 price range-needing white.  I had a Panasonic that lasted 8 years, but since then have gone through 3 in the last 5 years.  Two of them were another brand that only lasted two months, but looked to be the same design. This one has a poor quality door. The latch is temperamental, and I also noticed that when the door is closed the top edge seems a tiny bit loose which makes me nervous.  I have no way of knowing whether or not microwaves are leaking out.  I purchased this through Amazon because they lowered the price, but now it's too late to return.  I also read some reviews on how difficult it is to go through the manufacturer (Panasonic).  Because I don't use this very often, I am hoping it will last about a year, then I will look again.  I took a gamble, , and I lost.  Why can't I find a good quality microwave this size?"
1,I liked the size and power. BUT IT SMOKES WHEN I USED IT! I don’t think so. Sent it back right away. Used it once for test after it arrived. .
5,Ita small but it gets the job done
1,This thing only lasted 2 1/2 years. Just flat out stopped working. Something electrical burned out inside. No power at all.
3,"I do not use the device much as a single person. Bought Dec. 20, 2020 and today is January 18, 2022. Put coffee in to warm up and stepped away. Could smell burning electrical from next room. I live in a wood bungalow so always alert. Thank goodness it was just for 20 seconds and not longer. Keep looking for a different device unless you want to spend $100 plus a year for a microwave."
1,"This microwave will do the job, but have to push buttons 10 times before it works, doesn't heat through in amounted time packages require, you have to slam the door for a loud obnoxious sound every time and sound like it is cheap. I live and learn and should have bought a more expensive one. Pass on this one unless you are desperate."
4,"Space saver on the counter. Aesthetically pleasing.Heats my tea water in same time as larger micro.Light green is Very close to aqua. Does Not scream green. Unless perhaps you’ve got it next to a true blue/light blue.My Corelle Dinner plates fit, My 160z Starbucks tall white mug fits height-wise.There is no mention of a memory function others mention in the other colors. Really need that.It sounds as if some reviewers have opinions about the function of the eco button. The manual does not describe Exactly what they mean by “eco”.I’m Leary of the fact that we can feel air coming out of the front door when it’s running. I replaced my previous microwave bc little ants were able to get inside with the door shut. Didn’t seem microwave energy would be safely sealed inside. Now with this oven, feeling air coming through the door between handle and knobs, there’s little peace about that. Called manufacturer number in the manual, 866-646-4332, located in NJ. Tech said it was normal and okay. But... I don’t know. I will update my review after I purchase a tester that detects radiation specifically for microwaves (lol-if they’re to be trusted- cheap little devices)."
1,I liked the size.
5,"Well made, priced right, great deal."
4,"The microwave we had which was here when we moved in started to flake on us. I bought this because size and wattage is almost identical, I thought the extra features might be a bonus. It works well as a microwave, have to get used to the touch pad being in a different layout, also not being lighted in the dark it's an issue to just microwave something quickly, haven't really been able to use the other features, it's a bummer there now manual and I had to find it on the web, the other features might be a little bit more of use if there were a paper manual to reference as we worked to digest how they work, that's probably the biggest drawback"
2,Only used for a short time and it’s making a loud noise. I thought maybe the turntable wasn’t working properly but it seems to turn ok. Sometimes I’m afraid it might blow up I’m not sure why it’s so loud.
3,"This microwave works okay. It gets the job done. It’s a lot smaller than I thought. It’s too small to fit a dinner plate. It’s too small to even make microwave popcorn in. It also isn’t as powerful I’m used to. I have to cook things for twice as long as I used to to get the same effect. It’s easy to use, not too noisy, and fits nicely in the space so that is why I’m giving 3 stars"
1,"For a small microwave, it worked well at first but was noisy.  We don't use it very often so I thought I could live with it.  After about 18 months it starting making a very loud clunking noise when turned on.  It was not the turntable or dish - it was coming from the back of the unit.  I contacted Toshiba and they said it was probably a problem in the main motor and I could call a repair man if I wanted.  They will only cover their product for 1 year.So now I have to buy another microwave.If you can afford it - buy something with a better warranty or at least from a manufacturer who will stand by their products.I will not buy a Toshiba again because their products do not last and they have no customer service.Yes, this is a small appliance but 18 months and it breaks?  Not acceptable."
1,It’s a piece of junk. Box broke when it arrived. Had 5 intelligent people read instructions and tried to make it work. It doesn’t do anything the instructions claim to do. It’s going to cost more then it’s worth to return it. Very poorly made.
5,Great countertop microwave Heats things up really quick and haven't had any issues
3,Very small not the size I expected
1,As soon as you plug it in it starts running. It will not let you set any of the settings on it. Open the door it stops running. Close the door it starts running and doesn't stop. I have a farberware air fryer toaster and have never had trouble with it. Will not buy microwave again. And besides that the driver didn't carry it to the front porch he drugged it up the sidewalk.
2,Vented area in top rusted out in less than 2 years.  I leave the door open after use since microwaves have a history of rust at the door. This didn't help.  It rusted out before its time.  I now have a Toshiba.
5,"The Farberware microwave arrived yesterday and I am extremely pleased with it.  As a personal preference, I like white appliances and generally avoid stainless steel, but white appliances are getting more difficult to find.I was in the market to replace my old appliance that was beginning to have issues with not always starting.  My criteria was 1) must be white, 2) 1000 watts of power or more, 3) small footprint because I don't live in a McMansion.  With those criteria in mind, I set out on my search.  A took a trip to the local big-box W-Mart and was exceedingly disappointed in the options.  This trip was a reminder why I avoid shopping there.  I turned to an online search and, well, the current microwave items available are.... ok.  I was beginning to despair when I stumbled across this Farberware microwave.  Yes, it does have a stainless top and sides, but the front white door coupled with the stainless handle actually look a bit sleek.  The cooking options and power wattage were acceptable so I took the plunge.The microwave arrived yesterday and even with the stainless steel (ugh!), the microwave looks very nice.  I've used it a few times and am pleased with the lighting inside, the quick heat-up for my morning beverage, and also the decently even heat-up of the leftovers served during last night's dinner.  The quick heat buttons are also nice and it has the much desired ""add 30 seconds"" feature.  Farberware has come up with a very nice microwave and the price is not outrageous.  I'm giving it five stars even though I wish Farberware had also offered a microwave option with white top & sides.Hey there, Farberware, if you are reading this, consider offering this microwave design with white top/sides. Leave the door and handle as is - stainless trim for people who like stainless."
2,The turn plate motor is already having difficulty turning with choppy action and noisy. The thing has been barely used. The interface is also not intuitive. Will never buy this product again.
1,I loved this microwave at first until I experienced multiple problems.  The unit stopped heating so I unplugged it the first few times and it worked again.  I searched online and found out the magnetron may be bad.  I'm too frustrated with it so I'm just going to get a new one.
4,"Doesn’t take a lot of counter space, and it does its job. But it’s so light, when I push buttons on the front pad, the whole unit moves around."
3,"This microwave works OK, but not nearly as powerful as its wattage reports.  My older 800 watt microwave worked much better and was quieter.  This microwave is very noisy.  It does work, but not nearly as well as I had hoped."
3,"I specifically purchased this item because it was advertised as a combination microwave/air fryer.  IT IS NOT!!! It is a microwave/convection oven and does not do what you can do with an air fryer. I was EXTREMELY disappointed and now will need to take up precious counter space with an actual air fryer. This is BLATENT FALSE ADVERTISING. I only give it a 3 because I am assuming that it will be an adequate although space consuming microwave (Due to the convection feature, it requires quite a bit more space than a regular microwave)"
5,Works well. Looks good.
3,"I amended this review. We had an electrical circuit problem that affected the oven. It works o.k. and is 3 stars. Kind of noisy, not very powerful.---Usable cooking volume is only 0.66 cu. ft. (11.75 x 12.0 x 8.0 in). There are ""indents"" in 3 sides, but it doesn't increase the USABLE volume, because, DUH, the wall near controls has no indent. If you currently have a 1.0 cu. ft. oven, you won't be getting the same with this unit."
4,"I did research before buying this and it got great reviews. It's versitale, roomy, cooks/heats very quickly, easy to clean, and super easy to use and I've been very happy with it. I only gave 4 stars because the liner on inside of door is defective on my microwave and has a permanent wrinkle that gets moisture in it, and I forget things in the microwave at times because after something finishes cooking it beeps but then the screen goes blank and doesn't continue to show a message to remind me my food is still in it. Mostly a problem when I defrost and forget I put the food in until later."
1,"First unit I received from Amazon was Dead on Arrival, did not turn on.  Second unit worked well for 2 months, and then failed with an H98 error code.  Panasonic support was not able to reset it or replace it, so I will send it in for servicing."
4,"Initially I was annoyed with some of the user interface features, but I reminded myself that my old Sharp microwave lasted for 14 years and so I was very used to the way it worked and didn't really have to think about it.  The longer I have used this Panasonic model the easier it has become to use. Plus, I could have gotten the new model for not much more and that appears to have an easier user face.Things I like:It looks really nice, very sleek and modernIt heats well and quicklyIt has a ""Quick 30"" button and I find myself using that the mostI has a Popcorn buttonit is lighter than my old one and takes up a little less space, but is just as powerfulThings I don't likeNo beverage button (though the new model has one.  3 presses of the Quick 30 takes care of thatThe light doesn't seem as strong as my old microwave, but it might be an illusion.  If I turn off the kitchen light it seems just as strong and I think what is happening is that the kitchen light bounces off the shiny door and reflects back at you so it is harder to see insideNo button for common uses like Frozen Vegetables.  I have to press the Sensor Cook 10 times for frozen vegetables.  I got an index card and wrote down the number of times I must press Sensor Cook for the items I most often use.  Now that I have gotten used to it it really isn't a big deal, just annoying at first.The cord sticks out from the back of the microwave, the plug sticks out from the outlet and the cord is not flexible as most aren't for this type of appliance so I have to have the machine pulled out a good five inches from the wall so the cord doesn't rest against the microwave.  I am not sure if it is okay for it to touch or not.  Unfortunately my outlet is directly behind the machine.  This might not be a problem if you have your outlet in a different place.It is noisy, but no noisier than my old one, and maybe just a bit lessThe reason I gave it four stars is that it does its most important job well--heating food.  So far everything has come out just the way I want it.  And the longer I use it the easier it is to use."
5,Works well and great price.
3,"Looks great, matches my stainless Whirlpool appliances perfectly! However, the light is not working when you open the door, or microwave something. It's barely flickering... not sure what to do at this moment. Hate to have to send this back. Heats food just fine 🤔 other than that, I would rate it 5 stars 👍"
2,"Loved this microwave, compact and very easy to use and clean but, did not last long at all. Just over one and a half  year, it burned out yesterday.  Totally surprised and unexpected.  Not very happy about it at all."
4,Pleased with the ease of use and it is a small microwave so it will fit in a limited space but it is smaller than the listed dmensions.  I just needed something to fit under the cabinets and this one was supposed to clear by about 1/4 inch but actually is 5 inches below the cabinets!!
4,"The basic functionality of this microwave doesn't change much from previous models but the convection and broiling functions are not intuitive and difficult to use.  There are not instructions that came with the oven and when I asked GE for an instruction manual they emailed me a pdf that was rudimentary at best.  I think I'll be doing a lot of ""push this button and see what happens"" type of cooking with this oven for a while.  Not what you'd expect from a formerly top drawer brand like GE.  Call me disappointed."
2,Very unhappy with this microwave. The low power absolutely does not. Heat adequately. Would like to return it for a more powerful microwave.
1,"I don't require much of my microwaves, but one thing I do rigidly demand from them is that they don't catch fire.  And this one did, seconds into heating up some food, smoke billowing out from the mesh on the inside right.  What's most annoying about the situation, aside from whatever risk there was of it potentially burning down my house if I hadn't been there to see it, is that with situations like this the consumer is just screwed.  Sure, it's covered by a warranty, but now I've got to a) somehow package up and ship my microwave somewhere or maybe deliver it somewhere in person, b) wait presumably for weeks for it to get repaired...  or do I just plunk down another $200, get a replacement today, and move on with my life.  Ah well..."
5,"I was unsure to purchase this because of some negative reviews. My Microwave died so it's not an item worth repair shop I went to Walmart and bought a different kind I was disappointed so I did research and finally decided to order it.  I waited to post a review to see how it lasted. I LOVE IT!!! It heats faster than other Microwaves so adapt your cooking time.. this is NOT a problem to me it's a plus. Easy to clean, nice design I use my Microwave A LOT !!! So it was important for me to find a reliable one that has the features I require. This has the biggest interior of any I have owned perfect for larger Family or like me just want it to fit anything I put into it and wattage I need to make my yummy, famous Peanut Brittle."
3,"This microwave is fine, but has one annoying UI design error that I'm surprised made it into production:To start a cook or defrost time of say, 2 minutes and 30 seconds, you press the digits 2, 3 and 0. Just like every other microwave on the planet.To start a timer for the same duration, you must press the digits 0, 2, 3, and 0. If you don't start with a 0, you will be locked in to 23 minutes and have to start over."
5,I like the microwave. It is sleek. Standard kind of buttons that most every microwave has. A simple screen easy to understand. Simply push the start button for 30 seconds. Turntable Works nice and the inside is is bright colored versus dark. I think bright colored or white makes it easier to see inside the microwave. Perhaps dark hides food better.  I had a 900 watt microwave of the same size before and replaced it just so it would match other appliances better. This microwave works as good as the other one I had yet it is much quieter. I think that alone is worthy of an upgrade.  fast for the size.  Look at the pictures to see what the dishes look like inside it
5,The microwave works well for its size.  Please keep in mind that it is small.  It is an excellent size for a college student.
5,"GREAT looking, priced lower than other places. A really nice microwave. The design works with our stove and fridge, and looks like it GOES with them. But so much less expensive than others. Now, we just hope it lasts. We PREFER our major appliances to become members of our family as appliances use to be. Not a quick kiss and go.."
2,"I've owned this for 2 years now. The light broke within 6 months and now the magnetron has just died. On top of that it is not as powerful as my old Sharp microwave. I can't comment about the convection since I haven't really used it but it appears to work ok. I love the stainless steel interior - easy cleanup!! The auto reheat function is hit or miss. Sometimes it is right on the money. Other times it practically incinerates the food. Use that function with caution. One good function is the defrost function. It doesn't cook the edges before it is defrosted like some microwaves do. Maybe a function of the low power? Given the poor reliability and the low power, I can't recommend it. Too bad."
1,"Very bad quality,I just use it 4 months ."
1,"IT ONLY WORKED FOR 2 MINUTES! DID NOT HEAT! It came USED after being described as BRAND NEW. Disgusting. No pros, all cons. I have videos and pictures of this despicable item- Arrived in a old, filthy OFFICE DEPOT BOX that probably came from someone’s garage. Disgusting.- The manual came in a orange manual office folder taped to the plastic shipping bubble. Tacky.- MULTIPLE DAMAGES- FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER THE MICROWAVE, CLEARLY IT WAS USED- GREASE STAINS- Did not HEAT or WARM anything- ABSOLUTE FAIL"
3,"I got an email from GE asking me to review my purchase. It was mainly positive, except for my mention of not getting much instruction on the features. I didn't even post some of my concerns, but I will do so here: condensation builds up when you use it and I worry it will cause rusting, it takes much longer to cook things than any microwave I've ever owned, the buttons don't light up, so you can't see the writing in the buttins very well, the light inside the microwave is very dim, making it hard to see the food you are cooking."
3,"It was cheap, but you get what you pay for.  I was disappointed in the power.  Takes longer to heat up items than I expected.  It is adequate if you want a microwave for a small space but it barely accommodates a large dinner plate."
2,Works fine but there is a slight burning electrical smell from the outset. I don’t know if this is normal or not but I don’t think so.
1,Microwave stopped working about 2 months after purchase. I really only use it once a day to heat up coffee so it’s not like it gets a lot of use. Really disappointed in the quality of this produce and would not recommend to anyone else.
1,"Got this particular model because of the promises of a connected home and hands-free voice operation. Toshiba is a decent company and I had figured it was going to function.I was wrong. The app company behind the app you need to use the product is GARBAGE. The app itself is barely functional and I am unable to get it to work on my phone (Google Pixel 4XL) or on my partner's iPhone. The microwave time was set on the wrong time zone and didn't update automatically (as promised) like it would for daylight saving time.The app's support is broken and I cannot do any kind of voice commands or integrations. All their help has is a random gmail address (which I've emailed repeatedly for help with zero replies) and a few pages of misspellings and broken English that attempt to get you to configure router settings.I'm genuinely shocked a major company would partner which such a low-rent app developer. At this rate, we have a dumb, overpriced microwave that isn't smart at all and seriously considering returning this."
5,Tambien muy elegante
1,"Works for two days and then stopped working, returned."
3,I was excited to get a microwave with a dark interior and then went to use it and thought at first the buttons didn’t work at all. Then discovered when you push 1 you have to push above it to get it to work. Same with all the buttons. You have to find the spot where the actual button is and ignore the fake 1 on the microwave it’s just a guide to get you to somewhere around here. The bottom row is off to the side so I don’t know what the heck they did wrong with the panel alignment. It was way too much of a pain to send back so we have learned where to push for each function. I think it was in the irregular section.
5,"I've been wanting to change out our large microwave for a long time as our counter space is less than 5' and I was getting tired of having to continually shift things so I would have room to work. This is the perfect size, not only for where it sits but it will hold a 2"" plate of food for rewarming or holding till you can eat it.  The plate MUST be ROUND for it to work. Fortunately, I had 2 different sets of dishes, the square  set I had been using and a round set I had put away when we got the square set.  The square set made it so the carousel couldn't turn as the corners would hit the door etc.This one has a number of pre set buttons for certain foods etc. We are still learning about this microwave so don't know everything about it.  It's a bit less powerful than the old one but that's perfectly alright. One hugely great  feature about it is the number keypad.  The numbers 1-9 are all for that number of minutes so you don't have to key in those. Another feature is, say you want 4 1/2 minutes you hit the 4 and then the start button. The start button automatically adds 30 seconds to the time. If you are cooking anything over the 9 minutes, you hit the button for hand setting the time then key it in and hit start. Doing it this way, you can't add the 30 seconds. It's not hard to figure out the best buttons you want to work with.I wish I had gotten one this size years ago as there are only 2 of us to use it and  I would have had more needed counter space. The only thing that is noisy is the beep when it's done which you can key in not to beep but unless you plan on standing there keeping an eye on the timer, you won't want to activate it. I did then deactivated it as I would forget I was warming a cup of coffee or water for tea and it would be cold again when I remembered. It will beep 5 times.The door is a pull one not the button push one and I find that both have the same degree of loudness when you are opening and closing them. All in all, this is a great smaller microwave and I highly recommend it. I had sent my large one away in exchange for a smaller one, smaller than this one and discovered it was too small so measured what I wanted and found this one. If you need to know the size specifications, this one has them in one of the pictures and shows you so you can make an informed choice. Great price too."
4,"We've had it for about 6 months and so far so good.  It's a decent size and gets the job done.  We have a mix of white and stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, so the two tone finish fits in well."
1,"Cute, easy, great for small spaces but died within 6 months. Piece of crap and no returns or warranty after 30 days."
4,"A really good microwave for the price. Not the strongest of ones I've owned and it can take some time to heat up liquids, but for around $30 it gets the job done and still looks live with the silver and chrome look. Great for just starting an apartment or dorm room."
2,Was supposed to be air fryer convection microwave. Was small and no instructions for air fryer buttons. More of a convection oven. Lights on numbers and controls blue and hard to see. Looked up Toshiba website snd the sent me some recipes snd the same manual it came with via Internet but still not helpful. Returned it for free Thanks Amazon. Opted for Corsori air fryer which we love
2,Great microwave oven…until it just completely stopped heating at 18 months. I am hoping Panasonic will stand behind this.
5,"Small, but grat for reheating, cooking small items, takes too long for a frozen dinner..."
3,"This microwave heats ate the very bottom, makes some great volcanos. Our old Panasonic was a much nicer microwave imo.Works fine otherwise but beware and be ready to take the tray to the sink often."
5,"Finally, a microwave that doesnt require its own area in the kitchen.  This small 700w microwave works just as well the big boys for half the space and price.  Great features.  We love the 30s and 1minute one push options.  The sound can be alittle clunky but that works for us as my husband is hard of hearing lol.  I'd recommend this for small households, dorms and the like.  Oh one thing.. we did have to kitty corner it which works out for us space wise... but if you need to brace it or when you press a button the whole microwave may be pushed out of place."
4,Cooking functions work well but have had issues with light flickering during use. Disclaimer: I did buy this item used from Amazon Warehouse for a significant discount.
2,"Cheaper brands have better engineering.  It says, Stainless Steel and the pictures seem to show that, but only the front is stainless.  The cheap hard plastic feet slide in a smooth counter-top; the open button requires hard pressure, the turntable is not synchronized as with other brands, the handle of a cup entered will end up facing away from you and can result in burns; finished cooking buzzer sounds only once and does not repeat as with other brands; etc.  This is a cheaply engineered product."
5,"Looks expensive, arrived perfect. Works perfect."
2,Convection stopped working in two weeks. Microwave is OK.
3,Nice size. Cant use the timer for another process while it is already cooking something. It would be easier to open with a handle.
5,"This seems to be a great microwave so far. Easy to use. Quiet operation. Easy to clean with ceramic inside.One issue I had was there is only 3 buttons for quick cooking. 1, 2, 3, minutes only. You have to input manually if you want more minutes. No big deal, really.My old oven went to 6 minutes.For a 1.6 cubic inch oven for $150..00, you'd think they could add 3 more quick cook buttons.Sensor cooking is great, as well!I am really enjoying this oven in all of its uses, defrosting, reheating, power settings, etc.I'd buy it again, even though I've not owned a Farberware microwave. I have knives and cookware which are great!"
4,"This is the perfect microwave for your college student venturing out on their own for the first time. It is 1.3 cubic feet so fits regular size plate. And 1000 watts of power allows this microwave to heat food fast and evenly. It has six menu options of popcorn, potato, pizza, veggies, beverage and leftovers. All vital functions to come on a microwave. And even 10 different power modes. You can also defrost items by weight and time.So far it has performed well for the functions I used.Definitely recommend"
2,Completely died in less than a year.  Started smoking and putting out horrible smell.
3,"I haven't had a microwave in years.  I unwrapped and started reading instructions.  Only then do I discover that it requires a MINIMUM 20 amp fuse.  This apt has all 15 amp.  Have to return.  They should make this clear up front. I went back and looked and no where do I see in the details...  I have no idea when appliances started requiring more than 15 amp...  Given the pain, etc., to return, I deduct 2 stars, but I emphasize that I never used it."
4,"All round a very nice gizmo. Fits standard mounts, not too noisy, good features, cooks well, and seems like good construction though the stainless steel looks a little cheesy - all black is good. Maybe because it is more powerful than most microwaves this box destroys my 2.4ghz wifi ( 5ghz network is ok). I have 25yrs experience and an FCC 1st class license (microwave endorsement) so i know a little about the topic and that microwaves normally interfere with wifi, but this one does it big time. (i have two of the same microwaves in two houses with two networks with two different routers with same results. ) As i said, i bought two so i must think the interference is worth it."
3,"This does what it needs to do; fit in a small space and be easy to use. However, the rotating glass turn table does not fit neatly into the hub gear that turns it. That means it slips out easily and needs to be realigned most time the microwave is used. Other microwaves I've used had better fitting components. My elderly mom has a difficult time figuring out this realignment process and its a bit annoying she need to contend with that flaw. Otherwise, this has been a good enough microwave."
5,"I like the handle pull opening instead of awkward pushing a latch button. Also the white and stainless steel front instead of black. The exterior of the rest of the oven is painted, not stainless steel, but matches the actual stainless steel front perfectly.The sensor works very well (a great feature I always pay more for) and the touch panel doesn't require too much pressure. The control panel is well figured out - the Start button gives or adds 30 seconds and 1,2,3, and 4 buttons give that many instant minutes - all much more convenient and better figured out than some other microwave ovens I have used. Dark gray inside instead of the usual white."
1,The tree inside really sucks every time you put something on it it comes unhooked from the turntable pain in the rear end
5,"I replaced a 25 year old Panasonic with this Panasonic (hopefully this one will last as long).  I read the other reviews and here’s what I found:  it’s all about perspective.  This microwave works well.  The interior light is fine, bright enough for me to check on my food without opening door.  Button response is same as my old one, so no issues for me.  That muscle memory thing someone mentioned is real though so there might be a learning curve for some.  As for the person who charred the door from microwaving nothing for 1 minute - shame on you, you should know better.  The lack of an express button without having to press start might be an issue for some, but my old one was the same so I’m okay without one.  The issue with how to add extra time is a non issue for me as I just a reheater.  I don’t actually cook anything in my microwave, but perhaps with this new technology I might attempt it.  I went from a 900W to this 1200W, so things happen faster.  Good luck, it’s different for everyone depending on how you use it."
5,I like the look and the function .
5,"It’s small enough that it doesn’t take up too much space on my countertop. It’s pretty powerful…have used it to heat leftovers, pop popcorn, and cook frozen veggies. Very satisfied"
1,"I've had it for only about 2 weeks, and already the power button doesn't work(it came not working) and the clock button doesn't work properly(the only number you can type in is 1 all the other numbers do nothing) I tested all the other numbers in any other mode, they work fine. So, I recommend no one buy this heap of garbage."
1,"This microwave is fine, I don’t care about the Alexa integration or wifi or any fancy features. I wanted a microwave that fit a small space in our kitchen. I assumed I could also use the clock function to tell the time. This microwave constantly resets the clock. Sometimes an hour ahead, sometimes more. It is disorienting, frustrating and removes a very basic feature of use. What good are all the random fancy features if one simple and very basic feature is worthless. I have contacted customer service S requested, completed the recommended but not helpful updates and have not heard back in weeks despite additional attempts to resolve this issue. Disappointed and will not purchase again from this company."
3,This came in a damaged box. The microwave itself isn't as powerful as our previous 1000 watt microwave. It's noisy and just feels cheap. I can't really believe that it's actually made by Farberware.
5,"As someone who has Never used his oven or stove (only microwave and toaster oven), this is an indispensable appliance in my kitchen. It’s quite attractive but also quite large so measure your countertop carefully and check its dimensions to make sure it will fit. It has an extremely useful feature that automatically “senses” when your food is done and it works incredibly well (no more guessing when I reheat last night’s dinner).One caveat, since it’s so powerful (1250 watts): If the microwave directions say “cook on high for 1 minute for a 1200 watt unit”, cook for only 48 seconds (80% as long), otherwise you will overcook your meal. So for 2 minutes: only cook for 1:36; for 3 minutes for 2:24, etc. YMMV but this works for me after trial and error cost me a few frozen meals and microwaveable sweet potatoes."
5,"I bought this to replace a Sharp Convection oven. The Sharp is 3 times more expensive (approx. 450 versus 150) so I got the Toshiba. So far I find them different but have no clear preference. Both work very well for a person with no stove who needs convection as well as microwave. The Toshiba seems better built and the Sharp may or may not have better software - still learning the Toshiba. My complaint was the manual, which is very dry and doesn't explain anything - just gives steps that are sometimes confusing. However, the tech support rep answered immediately and was one of the smartest tech support reps I've dealt with. She explained everything that was bothering me, so my 5 stars are as much for that as the oven. I'll report back after I use it more, but that's the summary: really well-built, great tech support, mediocre owner's manual, incredibly good price. Sounds like 5 stars to me. One other point: the Sharp requires a physical button press to open the door and this periodically get out of whack and takes multiple presses. The Toshiba door opens and closes like a BMW or whatever - super solid. Also, the LED light inside is way better than the incandescent that was in my Sharp (about 4 years old). Also, needless to say, the Sharp broke after 4 years - not sure whether that's good or bad."
4,"I chose this microwave because my old one had it and I found that it heats food evenly. Be cautious about the height dimension: the description said it was 14 inches, but they didn't account for the feet; it really sits 15 inches high."
1,"My microwave stopped working after 7 months. There is a 1-year warranty. They sent an auto generated letter with instructions, which I followed and did repeatedly for hours. Nothing.  I wrote back that the magnetron was shot, dead. And they did not respond after many attempts to get some replacement or refund. DO NOT BUY.Ellen A."
2,junk
2,After one year of service this unit has quit working properly.  Only occasionally will the microwave come on.  After opening and slamming the door a few times will it activate and begin to work again.  This started about a month ago and has gradually gotten worse.
5,It works..
5,"It does everything -- cook, broil, air fry and convect (can you use that as a verb?).  The pad is easy to read.  It's incredibly quiet.  I've had it for 3 months.  Thank you GE for making something that really works!Only complaint is unless you clean it immediately it may take some elbow grease to get off cook stains. Also, I had never used a convection oven or air fryer before and it's taking a bit for me to get the hang of it. So maybe more elaborate directions?"
5,"First one was broken, Amazon made it super easy to exchange got new one and we like it! Works good! Looks nice! Cleans easy!"
2,It is not capable of preheating to 425 degrees.  It will try forever and not quite make it.No golden brown pizza.  just soggy microwaved junk.
3,I'm surprised there is not lights behind the control panel so it's very hard to see the button labels. It would be more use friendly if all the buttons would lit up when you open the door or when you press any buttons.
2,"The power in this microwave is disappointing - most recommended times are not enough.  Defrosting a pointless.  It came with ZERO instructions for air fry vs convection.  We bought this 14 months ago and the digital display is now broken.  Forget finding the customer service info online.  Now, to find the manual to call customer service...too much money for sub-par product."
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.  The control board already came off and I've had it less than 24 hours.  Too much money for such a cheap product."
4,The button panel can be fussy but that's a learning process.  Saved the box because I bought the extended warranty and another review said it was required for service /shrug
3,"The ""Quick"" buttons really do not work. How many people have just a ""Pound"" to defrost? If you have anything over or under a pound, you haver to use trial and error to figure the correct time and power setting to set. The same is true if it is beef, chicken, or fish. I could list a lot of other things that are useless, but my time is moiré valuable."
4,"reliable works well  easy to use  , just to small for my needs"
5,"This microwave was just the size, I was looking for my small office space.this microwave warms my foodso that I can eat a healthy meal, for lunch. Its sleek look, and it also keeps the time and heats up food no problem, its perfect!"
2,The microwave doesn't always work. The light will come on and it will run the timer but it's not cooking the food. I try to use it manually and the start button doesn't work. I'm really disappointed
1,Buttons hard to push...had to hold the microwave in place to push the buttons. ..sorry that I had to return it...Amazon was great making it easy to return.
2,Worked for 3 months and the microwave stopped working.  GE was not any help but Amazon specifically Shemar in customer service went the extra mile to keep their customer happy.
5,"This is the quietest microwave I’ve ever seen, except shutting the door (if they could only make that quieter!) But the features on it are just what are needed. The size is perfect for cooking or reheating. 1200 w is nice, and you can turn down the power level if you don’t need that much power."
1,"This microwave oven, highly rated, seemed to be an excellent value for the money. Unfortunately, the only one available here was described as ""Used - Very Good - Item has no cosmetic scratches or blemishes. Item has no cracks or dents. Item will come repackaged."" It was from a company called Warehouse Deals, Inc.It arrived packaged well enough, but the case was dented, as was the door of the unit. The cover appears to have been removed and improperly replaced, so that light shoots out from the corners of the case when it is on. The handle is badly scuffed. Given the condition of the packaging, It's clear that the unit left Warehouse Deals, Inc. in this sad conditionThat having been said, it does work; while the sounds coming from it when, for instance, the door is closed, seem particularly cheap, but I cannot tell if it left the factory this way or it a result of whatever happened to it afterwards enroute to its becoming what Warehouse Deals, Inc. erroneously claimed it was.I'll keep it because it's frankly too big a pain to pack it back up and return it. I hope the ill-fitting case doesn't prove hazardous. But I will go to lengths to avoid dealing with Warehouse Deals, Inc. ever again. In this case, at least, their description was a lie."
5,Size is perfect for power. Very happy with this purchase.
1,"Motor for the rotating plate stopped working after few months of usage. Called Toshiba support and no real support AT ALL. Even though product worked well, this is not a good product if stops working after few months of usage. Very disappointing"
4,"OUCH.  My Sharp 2.2 1000 watt gave up it's ghost after 22 yrs, so acquired this product few days back, and now see it is """"40 dollars cheaper"""".  Wish I could of waited.  I wonder how long this one will last.  Instructions did not show how to set up clock.  Was like the Sharp---push clock, set time, push clock again.  Buttons require fairly hard push to activate, but no big problem.  Seems solid.  This is important, yes look at size, but instructions on manual say give 3 inch clearance on sides and back, and 12 inch on top.  So need to add this.  Machine is quiet.  I followed instructions on booklet for microwave potatoes---did two, but would have hoped sensor would say done, but had to add another minute.  Did great with one potato. Of course have not investigated all the features, such as defrost, popcorn, etc. I do wish it had Inverter feature.  This microwave turns off and on at lower than level 10. Here is just a preference. If one wants to take the plate out to clean, it is kind of a pain to put back in place. When I put it together, the device that turns the plate has several diamond shaped areas that must match the plate exactly.  Apparently there might be a way to turn off the system where ever minute or so the machine will beep to let you know the cycle is complete, but have not figured that out. Just annoys me to hear it. But appears to only do this 3 or 4 times. I have a fear that the push latch open feature will malfunction.  I have read where other microwaves this broke and person could NOT open microwave. Lets hope this does not happen. Personal preference, I like the blue light over that of the white light of the Sharp I had. Seems to be quit powerful in cooking things quickly. Have did home microwave leak test (place your cell phone in microwave, close door, call that phone and if hear you have leaks) and passed the test.  Could not hear my cell phone.  If anything changes as to my likes and dislikes will put in later."
4,"I’m so happy with this purchase! I live in an apartment with a small kitchen so counter space is limited. My former microwave was so big I had to turn it sideways which made it difficult to get items in and out, not to mention took up the entire counter area. This GE microwave fits perfectly in another area and I can still use the counter. It is visually appealing next to the other two appliances which is a plus. Delivery was super too. It came about 3 weeks earlier than expected. There is one reason keeping me from giving a 5 star rating…There is a mild chemical smell which is not appealing when using to cook food. I’m hoping it goes away with time.  Overall I am very happy and so excited to take my counter space back! Not sure how long it will last considering the price point but the satisfaction I have now is well worth it."
1,"It seemed like such a great idea.  However, the airfry feature doesn't work.  If you use the rack the instructions indicate it is too close to the top heating element and burns everything before it cooks.  If you use the shorter racks it doesn't airfry.  I took a package of chicken thighs and placed several in this machine and several in the countertop air fryer I own.  An HOUR later the chicken thighs in this machine were finally cooked- not crispy on top like airfried but cooked through at least.  While the countertop airfryer cooked the thighs in 20 minutes.  I was so sad this didn't work as advertised.I also tried pepperidge farm turnovers.  As per directions I put them on the tall rack.  The tops burned to a crisp before they even puffed up.  I had to send the machine back."
3,This over came with almost no directions. I baked a frozen pot pie in convection mode and the glass shattered.
5,Bought this to replace a over the stove model that was over a couple of decades old. This microwave cooks faster and hotter. It is decently quiet and the stainless outside makes it look sleek. Overall nice for the price.
4,"Downfall, no push button to open"
5,"Works well.  Way more powerful than my previous microwave.  Makes crispy potatoes!  And no beeps!  The only way to silence the beep is immediately after plugging it in.  Press [Start] twice.Press [Timer (More)] to cycle between Beep on or Beep off.Press [Stop/Reset] to save setting.Otherwise, it beeps twice at five seconds remaining, then beeps five times when it’s done and keeps beeping even if you open the door.Great machine."
1,"Purchased this microwave on Jan 22nd,2020. Everything worked great as expected until July 17th,2020. Yes less then 6 months later as I was heating a cup of coffee up it started making a thumping noise, I looked up and there were flames and sparks shooting from the Right side of the microwave. We reached out to to Amazon Customer Service to report this and get some guidance. The 1st person we were chatting with said he was looking into the issue but after a period of time disconnected from our chat. The next person came on and said to email Amazon Warranty at warrantyquestions@amazon.com. We emailed them on July 19th it is now Aug 2nd and we have still not heard back from them! Do NOT recommend purchasing this Microwave as it lasted less then 6 months."
1,The manufacturer did not include an owner's manual on how to use this product.  When I called I was treated rudely.  If I was treated rudely when asking why an owner's manual was not included I can just imagine if I had a problem with the product.  I returned the product and will not purchase further appliances from GE.
3,"This works perfectly fine for my needs. The inside is just a bit smaller than I'd like. A standard size dinner plate barely fits. The plate touches the sides and prevents the inside turntable from turning. This causes the turntable to constantly get knocked off the guide upon which it sits. If it could be just an inch or 2 bigger on each side, it would be perfect."
1,Maybe we just received a lemon and the box did arrive damaged but when plugged in made loud grinding noise with stopping and then starting again that was very concerning.Returned for refund. Not a good experience. Would not buy this product again.
4,"Has features/functions on the panel different from other microwaves I've had so it took some getting used to.  The main problem I seem to have is hitting the pad in just the exact place, especially in the 7-power level-start area.  They seem to be too close together to get it right every time.  Occasional same problem in the 9-set time-off area.  I like the pull handle to open the door much better than the push button on so many (which tends to slide the microwave back to the wall every time you hit it).  And I really like the better, brighter lighting inside."
5,10/10
3,"It works fine, and I like the beverage and reheat options, but I feel like I have to stand by and watch because there's no ""time cook"" option for stuff. Also my last microwave had quick setting on 1-6 so all you had to do was pop something in, guess how many minutes it needed and then if it was 6 minutes or less tap that button. I'm not saying it's a bad product, only that it takes some figuring out"
1,"Microwave has almost caught fire twice. Fortunately, I was nearby when the smoke started. This time a small area on the actual wall of the oven seems to have melted. It has always made more noise than it should. The microwave has been cleaned. Today when smoke started pouring out I was heating a cup of water for less than one minute. Also, the wall had previously darkened. Something is wrong with this unit and I purchased it in November."
4,i like the fact that it was plug and play.Due to the simplicity of the model no instructions were needed which is a good thing because none were provided with the unit
5,"It's simple to operate. I have used it for heating and defrosting, and worked fine."
2,"Microwave worked fine. Basic, but easy to use. But it broke and entirely stopped working after only a couple months of use. Will not buy again. However they did refund so I was pleased with that."
5,Love it so many features very strong power. Large enough for family size meals.
1,"Microwave worked fine for a couple of months. Inexplicably started to smoke during use one time, and now anytime I turn it on it, immediately smells like something is burning (not food. Like a plastic burning smell). Definite fire hazard at this point. Amazon recommended calling the manufacturer, but I only get a busy dial tone when I try the number they supplied.I would look elsewhere for a small microwave."
2,We loved it until it stopped working. Only 18 months old
5,"This microwave replaces a recently bought Panasonic, which I did not like.  This Farberware has a easy to use handle to open and close instead of the other type.  The controls actually have digital numbers to push and the 1 thru 6  have instant ""minutes"", which I love.  The old Panasonic didn't have any numbers. And the controls are soft touch, easy on these old fingers.  Yes, it is a bit louder than any other microwave, but not enough to sour me on it.  And the UPS delivery man was very gently with it and polite (Amazon apparently contracted out the delivery of this).  I highly recommend this microwave."
2,"The microwave works fine for heating food for a short time, but when I try to use it for more than 3 minutes it stops at three minutes and completely shuts off and I can't turn it back on for like another 15 mins."
4,"This is a great microwave, I won’t lie, but if I’d known beforehand how annoyingly loud it is when shutting the door, I would have opted for another model. There’s no way to close it quietly, either. Believe me, I’ve tried. If it wasn’t for this obnoxious feature, it’d be the perfect microwave."
5,"I love the “crisp” feature, it almost works like an air fryer but you can not use metal or it will arch.  But my cauliflower pizza is now crisp on the edges.  I did have a microwave that was an air fryer too but it never got the edges crisp and I also used a Cuisenart pizza stone which helped brown the bottom some but never helped brown the top so this is a big plus for me.  It has a melt feature I like, the lights on the panel go off when you are not using it, the stainless steel is easy to clean and it seems to work well.  I’m happy with my purchase."
4,"This little microwave has a pretty stainless steel finish that looks great. It works great, but you do have to adjust the cook time because it is a 700 watt microwave. The button set up takes a little getting used to and how each button works. I don't like that when you use the timer it doesn't display - the clock displays. Very solid for what I paid."
3,Steam collects puddles of water where water leaks out when the door is opened and needs to be sopped up after each use.
4,Performs As Advertised
3,Not sure why ratings are so high. Giving it 3 stars bc it at least works. Buttons need to be pressed hard and/or a few times before it registers and it’s definitely weaker than my last microwave and need to heat things longer. Would recommend adding $20-30 if you can and getting a better brand that will last you forever. Got this largely bc it fits my space
3,The microwave works fine for the most part. What concerns me is that there is something wrong with the unit because the clock continues to add an hour. I don’t know if that speaks to me not getting full capabilities of the unit itself because something is obviously wrong with it.
5,"If you looking for a smaller microwave, this is a very nice one. It works well, looks good and is easy to use. It took me a while to remember to adjust the cook time, due to it being a lower watts, which I knew when I bought. I love the microwave."
4,"As stated, perfect size. That said, it is light weight. So, you need to hold in place while you open and close the door."
5,Great microwave
5,"This microwave is great!!! But, there are just a couple things the Panasonic design team needs to fix.- See my forearm? Those two scratches? I attributed the one that's almost healed to our sometimes sharp-clawed, always rambunctious Russell Terrorist, errrr, uhhhh Terrier. It was a bum rap! It was actually caused by what's shown in another photo.- See that sharp 90° corner at the top of the microwave door? Well, that's not quite as bad as the sharp corner at the BOTTOM of the door that is shown AFTER I took a file and rounded it off.- Finally, the hinge and associated trim only allow the door to open about 91°. That means the actual size of the opening is restricted. If it were to open juuuuuust another 5°, the ease of use would be greatly enhanced. Especially when inserting or removing cookware that requires two hands.So, Panasonic, fix the sharp corner edges on the door and modify the fascia and hinge to allow about 96°-100° of opening, and you'll have the PERRRRRFECT microwave oven!!!"
5,we have always had problems with painted interiors of microwaves. Under the turntable the paint always fails and the steel rusts. This oven  should last .The only down side is that the function buttons are a little hard to read. It would be nice if they made the print a little brighter.
5,I was really surprised at how quiet the microwave runs.  I'm used to the jet airplane my old one sounded like.  I like that it includes an air fryer but I haven't tried it yet.  I don't think it would cook a whole chicken like my current air fryer does.  But it's nice to have options.  The photo shows the control panel as having very bright letters but that actually isn't the case.  I wish they were brighter but I guess I'll get used to where each button is.  I really like the compact size (1.0 cu ft and 1050 watts) compared to my old one ( For a 1.8 cu ft and 1100 watts). It's almost as powerful as the old microwave but quite a bit smaller and with a smaller footprint.  It's perfect for me.
3,I needed a 0.6 and I thought that was what I had ordered.  this is too large.
5,It still works. I am impressed. It does warms my food pretty fast and nicely. At first I tried to warm up an oatmeal for two minutes and it was too hot so one minute and the entire food become hot. So be careful. It does have a great power. I like the color too.
2,It takes 4 times longer than convection toaster oven. Gets super hot. Can't use micro wave after using air fryer. I did and my plastic micro wave food cover melted to the glass tray.
1,The title says it all. When its in use its very hot. The digital display right out of the box is unresponsive. Faulty product on delivery.
2,The box it came in had a few bent up edges but I didn't think anything  of it cause I had worse box damage on other packages  and they were fine. Went to set it on the counter and heard the broken  glass and opened it to a broken turn plate .
2,"If you want a powerful microwave that boils and melts, then this is exactly what you're looking for, because that is what this does well. However, in our household we like to reheat foods for young children and adults, cook frozen vegetables in steaming bags, and get head-starts on dinner preparations. Doing those basic tasks with this microwave requires one to press a gazillion buttons to adjust the power down to 8 or 7, then set the cook time, then hit start.The most attractive feature to us was the so-called ""Genius Sensor"" that could supposedly detect food temperatures and reheat foods ""perfectly"". This never worked, not once. It boiled soup so that it took 10 minutes to cool to an eating temperature, it dried-out meats so that they were gross, and it never made anything faster. We followed the instructions about covering and poking vent holes and all of that, and it never accomplished its advertised function.When the first of these was shipped to us, it was an automatic fail, because the door would not open. Called Amazon, they were helpful, and they shipped a new one to us. When the second arrived and was set-up, it was a disappointment from the start. It is loud, and the interior LED light was weird—bright when you looked at it, but all of the food was dimly lit. Now both have been returned and the refund process is started. We ultimately moved to a Toshiba 4-in-1 and we are instantaneously happy with that. The described features of this Panasonic make it seem like an exact match for what we need to do in our house, but the execution was poor, and the results were unsatisfactory."
3,"So it worked great for 2 years until recently when it started malfunctioning. It started occasionally, and then frequently, and now everytime we use it, it blows the entire house's electrical box. We have to switch the fuse on the breaker box."
4,Love the look of this microwave and the almost mirrored front.  It heats food consistently and has more features than one could ever need.  The only downside is it is rather loud compared to other ovens.
2,"When I was trying to heat up my bowl of rice for a minute yesterday, right after pressing the number 1 button, the microwave's light just turn off and the whole system just failed to operate. Tried plugging it in to different sockets around the house, still didn't work. Hopefully their 1 year limited warranty will be able to help."
1,Works great but doesn't last long.  Stopped working after 2 years.
1,"Bought January 2022.  Door stopped working May 2023. This is our third try with the model.  Prior two were returned, as doors did not align right out of the box. We thought third time was the charm until the door refused to open when we pressed the door release button.  So don’t buy unless you relish paying $200 + per year for a microwave"
5,"Brought as a gift for my mom she absolutely loves it, she says it's easy to use, and she loves that it goes with her kitchen accessories."
4,"After unpacking this handsome microwave, we discovered it would not fit into our cupboard. The advertised external measurements do not include these plastic ""air ventilation extenders"" that Panasonic put on the back of this microwave. In an online chat, I asked if I could remove the extenders so it would fit as it was designed and described. The answer was no, because it would create a fire hazard since 3-4 inches of air circulation space is required to use this unit inside a cabinet as a built-in. That is important information so the vendor selling this microwave should add this tidbit into the description so people can make an informed decision about purchasing this unit. Luckily Amazon will accept the return."
4,Good.
4,"I have owned this for just a week over the 2 month return window. The turntable carriage has begun to make 'clunky' noises when it operates. So far, that does not seem to be an 'issue' per se, but what the heck? Also, while the manual insists that the preset power level of this microwave is 10, every time I check, the preset is at level 9. I cannot make the preset level 10, no matter what I try. In general, the microwave seems to be okay, but takes more and more time to reheat things like oatmeal (possibly because of the humidity sensor?) as it goes along.I bought this one when my 20+ year old microwave started dying. I do not think this one will last 20+ years. I am basically 'satisfied' with the unit, but will not be getting another one like this."
4,Everything works as expected and I am enjoying my purchase for the most part. But when it's running it is louder than I'm used to.
1,We had done a whole kitchen remodel. We had a perfectly good above the stove microwave. It made the perfect popcorn in just under 3 minutes and just about every kernel pops. Has much as I didn’t want to get rid of if. We had to find a new one. According to the reviews this microwave would be a perfect one. However it is not a very good microwave. Very disappointed! In fact I’m looking for a new one.
1,This actually came in damaged. When taken out the pieces just came off and the top is clearly bent and we can’t put the touch pad in because the plastic inside is broken and won’t sit correctly because of being bent
3,"Only had it for a couple of days but, what a difference.  Reheats quickly, soften/melt option is great. It's very sleek looking. Its rather quite, which is nice, wish it had a volume option."
1,Had microwave for only 10 months and it quit.  We had just used it to warm up some leftovers.  About 20 min later we tried warming up some more and after a couple seconds of running it made a zapping sound and just died.  PIECE OF JUNK!!!
4,I didn’t own a microwave and finally decided to get one. I use it to defrost meat multiple times a week!
3,"After purchasing this product 6 months ago, it’s already making noises. Not happy about that considering how much I spent on it."
5,"The media could not be loaded.That’s what I expected, looks and material are expensive. Love it"
3,I love the that it's multiple appliances in one. The biggest downfall is it blows fuses all the time. Fuses are blown even when it's not running. Blows fuses within 10 minutes of being plugged in.
1,"I hate this thing.  It started arcing, throwing off sparks like crazy, about 2 months ago.  I left it alone for a long time, didn't touch it or use it.  It still does it.  Awful.  Where is this thing made?  Does that make a difference?  Anyone else have this problem.  POS"
4,"I purchased this microwave for my office to heat up rice packs for my massage sessions. Fits well in the small space provided. Heats evenly. Sturdy construction. I ended up removing the glass plate and carousel doodad because the plate kept slipping and clanging around while rotating. Pretty much useless in that respect. My only complaint is how annoying the beep can be when finished heating. Three loud beeps with an obnoxious reminder beep if you don't take the item out right away. Also beeps when you open and close the door - what's the purpose of that? Other than that, I'd recommend this product for the price and efficiency."
5,Remodeled kitchen .. I was very concerned about measurements as they had to be exact as advertised.  Delighted to say I'm satisfied.  Love the gray interior adds a touch of elegance to the zebra like cabinets.
4,"A nice, simple, good-working microwave."
3,"This microwave cooks pretty well (as expected), but it has some annoying user interface quirks.  For one, it is more complicated to set the clock then any other microwave I've ever used.  It's like the clock function was programmed by an old VHS video recorder programmer.  And then it seems to have a million triggers to helpfully clear the clock setting back to default 0.  I've had the clock reset by pressing Stop twice too quickly, by opening the door too soon after pressing Stop, and by other random triggers I have not identified.  Why is the clock so difficult to manage?  I've only been using this thing a couple months, but I'm already thinking about ditching it for a different brand.  Another annoying ""feature"" is that when the time finishes, it makes the usual 4 beeps.  Except that opening the door does not stop the beeps, like it did with every other microwave I've had over the years.  I can open the door after the first beep, and it will keep beeping to let me know it's done after I've taken the food out.  My rule of thumb is that if I catch myself mocking or talking at a piece of hardware, it's probably crappy."
3,"This microwave is okay for the price, I suppose. I bought it because our new kitchen doesn’t have one built-in, and I hated how the original we had was just sitting on the counter. I wanted one that fit on one of our shelves so it was more tucked away, so this was the best option. (Mostly because it was the only stainless one I could find that would actually fit.) So for that reason, I suppose it’s okay. But it’s definitely lower-end, it takes way longer to actually heat something up than any microwave I’ve ever had. At one point I miscalculated how long to heat up a cheese wrap, I kept looking in and it didn’t look done so I kept adding time and it cracked my plate. That was my bad, but still, I wish I didn’t have that problem lol. It fits my dinner sized plates but doesn’t spin, and even has a hard time spinning with my smaller plates."
1,"We replaced our 20 year old Panasonic with the same brand. We were pleased with the product till today, 8 months later. Got a code H97. Panasonic wanted $7 to talk to tech support or chat from your PC for free. Tried but no luck with the chat"
5,"Only have had it a couple of days.  If I encounter any issues going forward, I will check back to lower my rating.  But, so far my observations are:*  Very well packaged.  It would take some exceptionally rough treatment in shipment to damage it.  This was one of my concerns going in.*  User interface is clunky for some of the advanced stuff, probably wouldn't be able to use some functions without having the manual handy.  But these are functions I likely will not use.  Custom functions, auto recipes for certain types of foods , blech.  I really just want a good microwave and convection oven, it's fine for that.*  If you want something that has one-button modes for ""fish"", ""beef"", ""pizza"", etc - I suggest something else, you has these functions but they are accessed through cryptic menu options that you will never remember without the manual.  It does have a popcorn button right on the front though.*  It's not particularly quiet, but not particularly noisy either.  Hey, microwave ovens make a little bit of noise, and convection ovens have fans.*  I could do without the big ""Toshiba"" plastered across the front of the door.  Free advertising, I guess.*  My biggest issue was the power cord.  It was short, maybe a couple of feet, and on the rear upper right.  I needed more length, the lower left would have been better, and a low-profile plug would have been helpful for my application.  I had to buy an extension cord to address these issues.*  It was nice that they include a couple of metal racks to use for convection cooking."
5,It heats up food quick! I can make great popcorn without it burning it. Nice and cheap and durable!
4,"I was inclined to give this oven a 1 star as it only lasted 6 mos and then it stopped heating.  However, Farberware's customer service was easy to call and very nice.  After emailing them the receipt and some pictures of the oven, we were told a new oven would be coming our way.  We received it the very next day!  I was pleased they were sending us a new oven, but to get it the next day was a surprise.The oven itself is easy to operate and does a great job heating food.  If I were to make an improvement it would be to make the interior light brighter as I cannot see the food cooking through the window."
5,I have a good and great microwave!! Thank you so much is perfect for my family
3,The inside is scratched and missing the finish in places. Not the upgrade I was hoping for from a trusted name like Panasonic Three minutes to heat a cup of coffee~basiclly folks~NOT SO MUCH~
2,It was much littler from the picture
4,Defrosting an reheating
1,"I purchased this for my parents who live in an independent living home.  They used it once and then it stopped heating up.  They had already trashed the box as there is no place to store such a large item.  This was the only way we could get it replaced.  So I bought them another and had it shipped.  They put the broken unit into the box and shipped it back.  I received my refund just fine.  But then, the second unit worked only one time.  Both times all the lights worked, the turn table spun and it beeped.  Just no heat.  Now they have the second broken unit on their counter with no way to return.  Erg.  I live 3000 miles away and this was an excellent way to ship them a gift.  Not sure what we'll do with this one..."
1,"The media could not be loaded.Box was broken, then the entire microwave was coming apart"
1,This was a housewarming gift bought two months ago and opened today. Handle was broken and now can’t be returned
4,"It is SMALL and COMPACT.  The button for door is a little stiff. Power wattage is low, but I think I misread the stats. Great for reheats and thaw. That is why we purchased. If you have small counter space too it's wonderful."
1,"I bought this one because it has a good review. Unfortuantely,  mine was not function at all within 10 days. I just warm up 3 meal with total 4.5 mins (1.5 min x 3）. It stop work like overheat protection. I ensure I follow all manu and instruction.  Probably, I am not lucky to get a bad one.Now, I redo the research. Place a new order still on Toshiba with different model. Wish it works fine."
2,"This unlit key pad has virtually invisible gray letters on black.  It needs some form of extra light, but a flashlight reflects off it. The only way for me is to memorize where ON OFF and the numbers are.  The interior light is a ghastly, spooky green.  The return to position doesn't work.  Having  read the other reviews, I won'r even bother trying the program timing. I like having a handle, but it is very big.This is a convenient space-saving size microwave for one person."
2,"This item was purchased for replace an Amazon Basics Microwave with Alexa.  It is a necessary item in our household for my nearly blind 101 year old father.  He relies on Alexa to use the microwave as he can not see the keypad.  We've only had this product for a few days and it stays offline a majority of the time making Alexa useless.  I've tried everything I know to boost the wifi signal but nothing has worked.  If I can't get it to work any better, I am afraid I'll have to return it and try a different brand.  The Amazon Basics unit worked fine in the exact same location.  Only replaced it because the inside was rusting out making it unsafe to use."
2,"Internal specifics see below lead you to believe cavity will hold aup to 12 inch plate not the case our 10.5 inch plate would not fit in the cavity. ""Internal dimensions: 12.05” x 11.97” x 8.11” (W*D*H)"" it's there statement on the site."
5,"At horse shows no one eats at the same time but when you do have time it needs to be quick. I used to use crockpots to keep soup or spaghetti sauce and hot water for pasta ready and hot water for cocoa etc. but transitioned to this small microwave solution last year. Omg why did I wait this long! I got restaurant to go soup containers and can warm up soup or pasta quickly with this out of the cooler.  No more 3-4 things plugged in at the barn, no more waiting for crockpots to finally warm everything up! A whole lot less to pack! And the quiet mode doesn’t draw unwanted attention!"
3,Works fine. Be warned it's pretty loud though.
5,"... but it lasted 5 years, not bad these days and at this price point, it isn't painful to replace."
3,Doesn't have a handle.  I should have checked before ordering!
2,This microwave worked beautifully for two years then the door thingamajiggy broke.  Cheap plastic parts.  Built in obsolescence.  Need I say more?
1,When we unpacked the microwave the air fry pan was bent. It could not be bent back to fit the air fry racks. I called manufactures customer service and asked if they could send a new pan. After 20 minutes on the  phone I was told she could not find the pan so she could not send a replacement. When I asked he what my options were she said I had to box up the microwave and ship it back and order a new one from Amazon. I returned the microwave but I am not reordering it. I will but another another brand. Also the air fryer does not really work. Food was not crispy when the air fryer was used.
4,"Wanted a mutable microwave and this met the criteria. However, it would be nice if stayed muted after a power loss."
4,"Works well.  quick delivery.  The driver helped my aunt take it up to her unit, she was very thankful for his kindness and professionalism."
4,"I needed a small microwave and decided on this one after reading the reviews. The reason I'm only giving it 4 Stars instead of 5 at this early stage (since I just got it last month) is there's a clicking noise as the dish inside turns which I find annoying. It is louder than my other microwaves have been but found I got used to it in a couple of weeks. I love the ability to just hit start for 30 seconds more, that's a great feature. The programmed buttons are also easy to use. The light inside is bright and the door easy to see through when using the microwave so one can easily see what's cooking.  This is the first Toshiba I've owned in decades. Overall I like it and hope it lasts for years to come as my other microwaves have done."
5,excellent product
5,Great replacement for old one
1,"Microwave turntable motor died exactly a month after the 1 year warranty ran out. Every other microwave I've ever purchased has lasted around 4 or 5 years. Could not even get 2 years out of my first experience with ""Farberware"" and it was a noisy hunk of junk the entire year we got to use it. I will never be duped into buying one of their products again. Customer service on this brand is nonexistant you can forget about that or this company standing behind their product at all."
1,This product throws out a smell from day one I thought it was the newness but it's now April 16 and it's still there..I hope I can return it.
2,"Not very powerful.  Took forever to pop a bag of popcorn compared to my old microwave, will probably return"
2,"Okay so this microwave does the job, I actually have no complaints about it microwaving food, BUT I've never see this in a microwave, if you microwave anything with moisture or water, when it's done the water condenses all over the inside of the microwave and so there are just drops of water all over the inside, it gets sopping wet and no this is not from overheating water and it exploding, it just does this! And since the moisture just apparently gets stuck there,  the inside begins to smell rancid, it smells like urine. I clean it constantly, I have never had to clean a microwave this many times. It's so odd and gross!"
4,Everything works as expected but ups just can't deliver a package without damaging it. Has big crease in top back thank God it wasn't in the front because it's all plastic.
5,I've never really had a microwave and didn't think I needed one. My girlfriend picked out this model and we love it. It's so quiet and we use it constantly.
1,"1 yr warranty in effect, but the micro has to be shipped to CA at buyer's cost $$$, unbelievable. Purchased extended warranty thankfully. We'll see how that goes..."
4,Has done everything I’ve asked forRecommend me and general purposes
5,The last one I had was a piece of junk
4,"It's a little pricey and 900 watts, but it is worth it in my opinion. Very dependable and user friendly."
5,"This is our second Panasonic microwave.  The first one lasted several years and had to be replaced.  We bought one we thought was superior but what a mistake.  It was 2 years of regret, 1000 watts and slow as could be.  We finally decided just to just give it away and buy a new Panasonic Inverter.  I researched it for a couple of weeks.  The reviews and the inverter heating convinced me this was the one we wanted.  I think it's top of the line, 1200 watts of just plain perfection.  The ""sensor cook"" (reheat) button is great, we reheated a dinner plate full of spaghetti and sauce.  We were skeptical and wanted to check it but we resisted.  When the time was up the food was heated EVENLY, no cold spots or dried out food.  Then the water test, 1:30 for water to boil in a coffee cup full of cold tap water.  Thumbs up!  And at last the popcorn test.  3 different weights of the bags to choose from.  We used the option for our size bag, perfect popcorn, nothing burned.  I cooked a bowl of instant oatmeal-it came out perfect and in less time than the box directions.  I love the ""quick 30"" second button.  That's all it takes to reheat a cup of coffee.  Need more time hit it again.  If I had one thing to be critical over it's the light on the inside.  Pretty dinky.  The inside has a blue/grey finish.  That light should have been the standard microwave light just for that reason.  The color doesn't help with the illumination.  Not really a big deal we do have lights in our kitchen ceiling.  Easy to clean off a splatter.  I like that it opens with a push button.  Just easier to clean.  It's small but not that small  It can hold a 10-1/2 inch plate with room to spare. This size is perfect for us we use ours just for the basic warm ups and small cooking jobs.  Worth every penny.  I have to admit this microwave was hard to find at a regular listed price due to the pandemic but Amazon had it for the listed manufacture price and we snapped it up.  Actually, I can't believe the price is so low for a quality microwave like this one.  Very happy with our choice."
1,"When you follow the registration steps as provided on a registration card included with the microwave, it doesn't work. When you enter all the information required and click submit, you get a message saying ""invalid brand or model number"". It won't accept the Midea brand or the EM720CPL-PM model # as shown on the label on the microwave."
2,I bought this item in May 2023 and there has been 3 times when my food does not get hot. I turned it off overnight. That worked however yesterday this has not helped. I dont know what the problem is since the light is on in the microwave.  This has never happened when I purchased a microwave and I cant return it. What can I do?????
1,The door was so misaligned we couldn't get it opened.
5,"Powerful.  Presets do seem to be more time based than sensor oriented, but other than that have been happy with it.  Quick settings good when you get used to them"
3,Way to small for my family. Doesn’t fit dinner size plates
1,WORST MICROWAVE EVER! My dad ended up buying this and it can’t even heat up cheese dip after 3 minutes in and stirring!!! Horrible I would love to return this...
2,"Stylish, easy to use and fit perfectly in our space but at 28 months, the finish started peeling off the surface and corroding inside at the bottom front.  At 34 months the door safety switch failed and the microwave dangerously turned on whenever the door was opened."
4,"I bought this as a gift for my grandmother, she loved it. It's pretty big, so be mindful of space. Heating is great and I've had 0 issues with it. Heats food properly, easy to clean. Only reason for the 4 stars the plastic looks a bit cheap in my opinion, but my grandmother liked it. Great unit for the price."
2,Microwave packaging is not good. Product came with a broken turn table ring. I would like a replacement turntable ring so that the microwave is functional . I am unable to return the microwave since I live in a different city.
2,"This microwave performed well under light use (around 30 minutes a week) for just over a year--a couple of weeks longer than the warranty. Turned it on and it worked fine but when we went to reheat our coffee again, there was nothing. The unit was warm to the touch, but not hot, and there was no damage to the cord or outlet. It just stopped.I contacted Toshiba and was led down a brief rabbit hole of troublshooting, photographing and submitting of details which ended up taking about an hour of my time. This was not a problem. I told the service rep that the unit was a couple of weeks past its warranty but figured that it was so close that a fair consideration might be made and I was led to believe by the person I spoke with that it would likely be so.A few days went by and I got an update saying that the warranty claim was under review and that, once approved, a reimbursement check would be sent to me. Vague (sort of) language which was pretty leading that caused me to believe that we were moving in the right direction. Then today I got another message telling me that the claim had been denied.I don't have a problem with the denial. Not at all. But what I have a problem with is the interim message suggesting that my claim would be honored. Like, why even bother to send the interim message? Why mention the sending of a check until that's a relevant point?This behavior by companies seems to be the new normal as I have been the recipient of such things many times over the past year from a claim on my homeowners' insurance, to a selling issue on a major reselling site, to a number of other situations. And my point is that companies need to stop appearing as they're accomodating until the confirmation of their ability or willingness to accomodate has been finalized. It's tedious and exhausting, and does nothing to build brand loyalty. As a result of this I will likely never buy another Toshiba product because one, they just don't last, and two, because their response was wholly lacking a reasonable professionalism one should expect from such a company.Buy this if you wish. It was great while it worked but it probably didn't last more than 30 hours before it went kaput."
1,mine had a big dent on right side
3,"Bought this for my daughterRCA RMW733-BLACK Microwave Oven, 0.7 cu. ft., Blackas she needed a quick replacement.....it's a nice enough item just very small...we chose one that was not the best size for her needs."
2,"where to begin with this microwave.Yes I have owned for year or a bit longer,it is light and chintzt,lound moves around due to it being light it is nothing special.Microwaves are nothing one should purchase on line. I think thet count on you not sending it back which is correct in this case.Better off going walmart to look and see."
4,"The first one I received wouldn't turn on (no damage to the box). The exchanged with Amazon without issue, second one works just fine. Nice small size (not too small), used for a classroom."
5,"I got the version that doesn’t have the microcrisp feature, which is fine since I have a breville that can do the same (air fry) and more. This chefman is good-looking; also functional and quiet. The only thing I don’t like is that I have less space on my counter now."
5,It looks and works great!
5,"This microwave is awesome! Not too big, not too small and doesn’t make much noise. I love it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
3,"I usually review a product after some use, but this has just been put on my counter.  It came dented, and I suppose it it is a risk one takes with the mail.  But I spent a not so insignificant amount and am very disappointed.  It seems damage usually occurs on the top of microwave ovens so, maybe something could be done for this area's protection?  I have only plugged it in and tried a button to test the noise.  A bit sharper and louder than my old one, but I believe this has a silent operation option.  The new, bluish led lights will take a bit to get used to but that's alright.  I might keep this if I had a significant discount, but I will try to start the return soon when I have help to move it. If you care about looks, buy in store."
4,"***UPDATE*** I wrote this review in October 2017 and had it for 6 months. It is now July of 2018. Had this for well over a year now. I can say that the 4 star rating holds up nicely. The size of the microwave has been its best feature. Can fit our biggest containers in this without worrying about it. Turn table still works just as it should. Other than normal mode and popcorn mode, we dont really use this to defrost anything. If youre buying a microwave with hopes of defrosting.....youre doing it wrong anyway. There is one thing that I wish the microwave had that some others had. I wish it had the ""Quick start"" feature, where buttons 1,2,3 can all be pressed for respective minutes. I mean its a laziness thing overall, but our old microwave had it, and it is just slightly less enjoyable to type in 1:00 instead of just pressing 1 and youre good. Total first world problem but....oh well. Its not a criticism. I just really wish it had it. Anyway. After 1.75-ish years of having this microwave. It still is powerful and works very well. Great size and light still works too. Would recommend.Only have had this for about 6 months so far, and it is working just fine. I'll go for a quick breakdown review+ Big and deep, the space of this microwave is nice, considering so many microwaves these days are so small in cubic feet. 2.2 is nice for big containers+ Popcorn levels: We love movies and popcorn. We like that the popcorn levels is adjusted by size of the bag in oz. and it heats it up rather nicely. Never get zero kernels, but less enough to be efficient!+ Have yet to try any of the Turbo defrost or sensory cooking features but its nice to have them when we might need them.+ bright door light+ 1250 watts for high powered microwavingNo real negatives so far. The heating seems to be pretty even. Although we are pretty good about separating food or opening space up to help with that. Will update in maybe 6 more months unless something goes wrong."
5,I did not use it but I was told they really liked it.
1,"Got 3 years ago. First of all, numbers on a little window started messing up. Then you can’t use some buttons, like defrost, cancel and some numbers. You only have a few choices that you can use. Yes I’ve been using almost everyday, but it’s used only 3 years. Then it just turned to useless and uneasy to dump junk. Don’t buy."
4,It gets off track really easy and makes an artful noise.  Works great other than that.
2,"I bought this in 4 years ago. The light stopped working a year ago.  Tonight it totally died. Im sorry, I think a product should last longer than this"
4,Only thing I don’t like is a regular size bag of popcorn is to big it doesn’t turn properly.
5,"Muy hermoso y súper buena calidad 👍🏻 Le doy un 💯 llevó una semana con el y no me a dado ningún problema, calienta rápido."
1,"I’ve had this for three years, and the keypad is starting to fail. Was very serviceable until this point, but it’s not durable, too difficult and too expensive to fix, and so another badly made appliance turns quickly into toxic waste. My mom's microwave is going on 15 years old, not a single problem. This is the last Farberware product for me."
3,"The buttons on mine are marked a little differently, and there seems to be no way to set the clock. Shouldn’t be a big deal, but I’d really love to know how!"
3,"First, it is not a powerful microwave. It works fine, but it heats the dishes hotter than the food.I have been microwaving my bowls for years with other microwaves. They are glazed ceramic. Every time I put these in defrost they bleed some weird brown goo that I never saw before this microwave...I can't imagine this is a good thing... They do it every time. It's really gross. Yeah, I can use other bowls, but why do I have to change all my dishes for a microwave?? Makes me reconsider using a microwave at all at this point..."
2,"This unit cooks unevenly.  Bacon to outside  always cooks twice as fast as inside of plate.  The turntable is jerky, not smooth."
3,"Can't just go on line to register for the warranty.  Need to call it in.  Very noisy.  Seems o.k. for cooking, easy to use.  Only had it for a day."
1,In order to get a 10” plate into the microwave you have to tilt the plate.  Then you have to worry about food spillage.  Inside  the microwave is 10-11 inches but not on the outside
3,"My 35 year old microwave quit, so I bought this one, over twice what I paid for the old one. It's a whole lot quieter than the o;d one, but maybe they get noisier when they get older.""Think outside the box"" is to developers, meaning how the ultimate consumer will use it, and it's pretty good in this respect, except for the turntable. It has to be lined up perfectly after cleaning, and is hard to line up. It would be really hard for someone with reduced vision, they really need to work on that part."
2,It's didn't go with the rest of my kitchen
4,"Nice cheap and simple microwave. It doesn't have a quick 30 second button that I came to appreciate on the last microwave, and even though I measured out 0.7 cu ft on my last microwave, this one is quite a bit smaller interior than the old microwave. Still, it works well and you can't beat the price point, so I still give it a pretty solid review."
5,I was a little hesitant due to price but this purchase has been worth every penny. The technology of even heating is perfection and the settings are easy to use. Large enough for a platter to fit. Highly recommended!
5,Exelent
4,"This 0.9 cubic foot microwave is a nice compact size, suitable for kitchens with limited space and/or low clearances.  The interior is tall enough to easily fit relatively tall coffee mugs; the turntable is large enough for full-sized dinner plates, with a bit of room to spare, making this microwave well-suited for most normal usage.  I was initially excited to discover that this appliance has a feature to turn off the annoying beeps, by pressing the ""8"" button for 3 seconds, but that function doesn't seem to be working.  Otherwise, the features I tested seem to be working as advertised; this is a pretty standard microwave, with a logical and intuitive layout for its controls.  This microwave is attractive, with black sides and top, and stainless frame and handle accents only on the front of the microwave.  This is a functional kitchen appliance that is especially well-suited for use in smaller kitchens, but its medium size might make it most useful for individuals or smaller families, rather than for larger groups."
5,Perfect size for where needed. Love the dark gray interior.
5,"My  Wife uses this as Her only  Oven. Since 1989 She has had to get by cooking with just 3 stove top burners and a Microwave Convection Oven. We've gone through 3 of the GE brands that are over $600 each and they were great, but  they have some switch inside them  that goes bad after a few years and We have to have a repair guy  come  to the  house to replace the micro-switch. The last one We thought was out of warranty so I bought  this Toshiba. This is half the  weight of the  GE,  and under 2/3 the size, but the inside size of the oven is the same as the larger GE unit  but it takes up less counter space and it has worked flawlessly for over 2 years. After buying it We realized the  GE still had 2 weeks of warranty on it so We had it fixed and  put it away in case anything ever happens  to this Toshiba."
3,"The item was marred on the front door on the top  rail and left side rail along with some marring on the window, specifically what I requested not to have with this used microwave. Apparently it had been cleaned previously with an abrasive cleaner and was returned. I requested no front  damage but I guess I got what I paid for, disappointing esthetically. The function appears to be okay at this time."
5,"Glad we bought this.  It's very, very quiet.  You can even turn off the beeper.  Most important, it's the perfect size for Hungry Man dinners."
1,"I have bought two microwaves in the best 2 1/2 years.  One was a Black/Decker and this one was GE!!  I only have a small space and the dimensions worked.  Insturctions  are worthless!!!  Slides all over cabinet and can't read the numbers.  Would have returned it but am elderly and it is too heavy, plus there were no papers in box to send it back."
1,Worked great the first few months but fifth month almost caught fire! Couldn’t warm up anything for even one minute and it would start smoking badly. Unable to return as it’s been 5 months but hopefully my review would help someone else not to waist money on this product.
4,"After 36 years, it was time for a new microwave. How cool that I can have Alexa start my cooking! Although, it wasn't very easy nor clear how to set it up. I think I did it totally by accident! There are more steps to manually start this model than my old microwave, but I think it's just ME getting used to another device."
5,"Bought this March of 2019.  It has taken all these years to argue with Panasonic.  It worked twice and quit. I called them and e-mailed them.  I finally called Amazon A to Z and after one phone call, I received a brand new microwave of the same model.  Make sure if you buy ANYTHING from Panasonic you contact them ASAP if it quits working.  Probably will need to have Amazon contact them.  Panasonic will not honor any warranties."
4,No issues with the microwave Alexa doesn’t work. Same issues as everybody else with being able to connect. Besides that it’s fine I do like that I can turn off the beeping because it drives me crazy and I still was able to download the app to control it remotely if for whatever reason I didn’t want to get up to stop my popcorn from burning.
5,Good Value and works like a charm!
5,"I had a larger model of this type Panasonic microwave and it was the best one I ever had, lasted for 15 years or more with heavy use.  I read the reviews but went ahead and bought one which had a September 2022 manufacture date. It worked 5 times then gave the H97 error code.  Thanks to Amazon's policy I was able to exchange it quickly and received a replacement which had a November 2022 manufacture date.  I have had countless Panasonic products besides a microwave and have never had an issue with any.  I called the Panasonic customer service and asked them if they were any quality control issues.  They were prompt and courteous but stonewalled on that as expected and said to send it for repair.  So far the replacement is working well.  The functions do take getting used to and if the power goes off you have to jump through hoops to reboot but not big issues for me.  It has plenty of power."
3,"Meh...Findng the reheat buton and other important functions is an expedition into nowhere-- no instructions included. Miss the GE.Shouldn't have to be classified under""background in rocket science helpful"""
2,"We paid up for this premium microwave, excited for the ""Inverter Technology"" that supposedly cooked more smoothly. Unfortunately, I would say that this microwave is worse than past microwaves, specifically in the area of heating food smoothly. The microwave works fine otherwise, but I wouldn't recommend this model if this is one of the reasons you are considering this model."
4,I just downsized my living space - so instead of having 2 large portable appliances — I only have one.  It is a space saver!
4,Pretty good. Door got annoying but WD40 fixed it.
1,I purchase this for my kitchen and was not ready to use it. When I was ready 6 weeks later it didn’t even work!!! I have passed the return date but it is a shame that it never expected this to happen!!
4,"This is a great microwave for small space.  It's quiet, has good features.  I like that there are no vents on top so I can place things on top.  The only thing I don't like:  even though there is a light inside, the interior is gun metal gray.  I would have preferred white."
3,This is a great little microwave. Powerful for the size. But after a few days the door doesn’t pop open when you hit the button. You have to hit the open button and pull the door. Kinda inconvenient and disappointed but we’re making due for now.
1,"The media could not be loaded.Bought this Farberware microwave to match my black stainless steel appliances and desperately needed a new microwave! First, upon arrival I noticed it was in just the original box you would buy a microwave in stores in and the box was damaged. I thought no biggie maybe the microwave is fine there is styrofoam inside the box to help protect it. Pulled it out the box and seen no damage. However, after setting it up and running it, this thing is SO LOUD! It literally sounds like a loud vacuum cleaner and rattles like no other! I also noticed a VERY VERY STRONG CHEMICAL SMELL! It was so horrid, it smelled throughout my entire kitchen! Once again, I really tried to give it the benefit of a doubt and tried heating up some food in it. Well, my food tasted funky and again with the horrid chemical smell! I do NOT recommend buying this microwave! I should have known better from all the bad reviews on here, they weren't lying! I sent this disaster back and got my refund, will look elsewhere for a microwave."
2,"We were needing a microwave to replace our old one.  When we got it, it had scratches on it.  Cleaning the outside does not clean or shine up.  We followed the cleaning directions but to no avail.  We had to keep it because of our situation.  Didn't have time to return it."
3,Double the time for heating due to low power .
2,Was microwaving soup and came back to a popping sound. I expected the soup to be hot but what I saw was a rotating plate covered in Campbell's chicken noodle. I thought maybe it had boiled over so I cleaned it off and tried to finish microwaving it only to discover the popping was caused by the plate bouncing into the air slightly which was spilling my food.
5,We have it for the braeck room at my workMore then 5 people useit every day
1,Not bad. Until it failed after 15months. AVOID.
1,Do not purchase. Cheap. Will not ship the color you chose. Made poorly. Over priced. You can find same brand and better for FAR less expensive than the $180 paid for this hunk of garbage. Box even came super banged up and damaged. Had scratches and dings in it. 0/10
4,"Fits perfectly in my pantry. Love the small footprint but still jas a good capacity. Just what I wanted. I just wish the ""beep"" was a little louder."
3,"The microwave arrived next day with no issue, and powered on just fine after being plugged into a grounded outlet, but the internal light won't go out, and the start button doesnt start the cooking cycle. Requested a refund."
1,"The media could not be loaded.This was the best rated microwave that would fit in my kitchen, and replaced a sharp carousel that stopped working after 5 years. It is maybe 50% noisier, about as loud as the old dishwasher. The interior light is so dim I can’t tell if the oatmeal is about to boil over. The surface is mirrored so I can’t see the time unless I’m looking at the time straight on. Other than that it heats well and evenly.UPDATE JAN 2021: less than 4 months old, the light bulb won’t turn on. I can’t return it to amazon and I have to drive 45mins away (so 1 1/2hrs round-trip) to drop it off at the closest repair shop. When the shop fixes it, I have to drive ANOTHER 1 1/2hrs to pick it up. I hate this thing!!!"
4,"When we opened the undamaged box, the bottom of the unit was dented and does not sit sturdy on the counter.  It wobbles.  I decided not to return it and will deal with it.  My grandkids use it enough to be without a microwave isn't an ideal situation to be in.Other than the damage to the unit, it does operate just fine."
3,I bought this to replace a Walmart cheap Hamilton Beach which lasted about 2 and half years. So I thought I would get a better one that would last longer. But I think this unit may be a returned item that they put back on the shelf and resold.I got this one and I first noticed a strange sound coming from the turn table motor sometimes. So I immediately bought a warranty policy to cover it. That sound has gone away for the most part but it has started to take longer to cook things. Items that took 2 minutes it now takes 2 minutes and 20 seconds. At what point does it become an issue? So I’ll let them know and put them on notice. We’ll see how Amazon handles this and I’ll let you know. So far they have been really good about taking care of issues.i buy just about everything from these amazon so i would expect them to take care of it
2,"Sorry Toshiba, sorry Amazon, but this will not be a positive review. The oven so far is garbage and my exchange experience has been slow and sloppy.If the replacement oven ever arrives and if it works as advertised, I will be happy to upgrade this review. I really, really hope the replacement oven doesn't crap out, too.I got this microwave combo only weeks ago (and it has been non-operational for a week of that time).First impressions:It's big!It's attractive!It's so shiny!It's more complicated to use!But sadly, my Toshiba 4-in-1 microwave is a 0-in-4. Give it 0.1 if you count the LED clock, I guess.I wanted to love this oven. Alas, I was TOO ready to love it when I got rid of all the separate appliances I thought it would replace, including an air-fryer,  toaster oven, portable broiler and the old, failing microwave which prompted this purchase.I should have saved the packing matetials, but didn't.In buying a four in one oven, I had hoped to clear some space in my small kitchen.I had no available space for boxes and Styrofoam, so I pitched them.Bad idea.I literally had to order a replacement of the same make and model so I would have boxes for sending back the original, defective item.After reading critical reviews of this oven (which were fairly hidden among the positive one) many of which are very recent, I wonder if a bunch of these ovens passed quality control that should not have been sold.And now the replacement item is delayed. It's conventional oven or stove top until then, which means coming home tired after 12 hours on my feet and having to soil pots and pans to feed one person.Every time I have to go ""old school"" to heat a *microwave* meal, I get angry all over again.By the way, for the handful of times I used this 4-in-1 marvel, it worked kind of okay. It could be a learning curve for the convection/air fry features, and considering how quickly the Toshiba stopped working that curve never happened.On the final day of use, I attempted to heat a casserole in a Pyrex dish using the sensor cook feature.A few minutes in, the oven powered off and it took an hour or so to power on after plugging it in again.But, following the shutdown and eventual power up, the microwave function barely worked at all. After a second effort, it made 1/2 cup water lukewarm but not before becoming extremely loud and buzzy when it ran, so I shut it off and contacted Amazon to begin a return.So just know, I really am not happy about getting an exact replacement of an appliance that has failed so spectacularly. I don't even know how the average reviews are so high after reading many and considering my own experience.I don't like writing negative reviews. That's why I gave two stars instead of one, and considering the work involved with repacking the original purchase and hauling it to UPS (I am almost 65; I need my energy for working!) it wouldn't be unreasonable to give zero stars until this this situation is resolved.As I stated in the title, save your boxes!!I would have sent the still-sitting-in-my-kitchen broken unit and chosen a different make/model except for having no cartons for shipping this large, heavy, expensive, almost non-functional, 1.5 cubic foot CLOCK.Just know that if the replacement oven croaks as well and I cannot get a refund due to having to send packing boxes from #2 to return #1, I will be posting a demolition video on You Tube starring me, my son (he has sledgehammer and other heavy equipment) and the oven."
5,Tiene un aspecto bonito y no es ruidoso
2,"This was ok to start, but the rotating disk was always noisy and now the door latch has broken. Not really worth the money."
5,"it's a combi-oven for $250, what's not to love?"
4,"Overall size is smaller than my old one (just what I wanted) and the interior holds all the things I need heated up—-leftover casserole, frozen and fresh veggies, tortillas.  Defrost is easy to use and resetting the clock was simple.  My only complaint is the open latch, which is a bit of a pain to operate at first.  I think it would be better if it had a handle you could pull to open."
5,"The media could not be loaded.I bought this cuz of the reviews, it's just big though for a dorm or a small kitchen space. I didn't need anything big, it fits a dinner plate.I don't use it much but the times I've used it, it works great. I'm sure I'll use it more over time."
1,"We purchased our microwave almost exactly 1 year ago and today it stoped working. The microwave started sparking, smoking and making a really loud cracking noise. If my husband hadn’t been home to stop it it would have caught fire. This microwave is dangerous and there is no way to get a refund because it is outside of the return window so I won’t be purchasing any appliances on here ever again."
5,quiet
3,I wanted a larger unit that fits in to our cabinet.  This one looks funny because it is smaller than advertised.
2,I’ve have this for under 3 years and the whole inside is bubbling and rusty. Disappointing
2,"After 9 months of trouble free use, the heating element at the top now heats up every time we use the microwave function."
2,"They will try to get you to spend time and money shipping back the one you got, instead of simply forwarding the parts they missed. Took a month to get the entirely new microwave here. It came 3 days after the return label did. I took out the tray and roller as I needed and put them in my already setup and Alexa configured microwave that I had for a month not being able touse it. Boxed back the new one sent to me and applied the label. Turns out I have to pay extra for a pickup now because they timed it poorly. Not happy at all. I have wasted far more time trhan any money saved. That and this was a $144 microwave on sale, not that cheap for a small unit. Stay away or the dice with fulfillment."
3,"This microwave works great, has plenty of room, and is really quiet.  We love it. Update review.  This is the most aggravating microwave I have ever used.  It is constantly needing to be reset like a computer.  You have to unplug it or in my case throw the circuit breaker to reset.  Then it works fine for a while until you have to do it again.  I will not buy one like this one again"
2,I knew .7 cu ft would be small but this sucker is tiny. Anything larger than a saucer wont fit/spin on the microwave plate. Ended up sending it back.
4,"This has to be the loudest Microwave in the universe.Half the time I don't know if I was getting microwaved myself by the intimidating sound.When its done microwaving, the Beeps are obnoxiously Long and Drawn Out like it was made for someone with hearing loss.I like the look, the LCD Display, and the features it holds, but dang its the loudest thing in my Kitchen.Pros: Popcorn Button Actually Works on this Brand. Easy to clean. And it heats the food more than it does the plate.Con: Everyone in my Apartment within my floor and wall distance can hear me use it.Otherwise it works and does the job."
4,Love the dark interior. Easy to clean
4,"It seems that the round wheel piece under the glass plate is slightly too large and it makes a lot of scraping noise. All replacements I've found are identical in size, so I don't see a solution. I believe the finish will wear off very quickly."
2,No option to silence - I don't need the beepsNo quick start - heating up a 'cuppa shouldn't take hitting the keypad four timesUser interface basically stinks but it would fit a small turkey and heat it in 20 minutes.  Reasonable price but the lack of ergonomics shouldn't have had anything to do with the price .
2,"I was happy with this product as a much better replacement of GE, but it stopped working after only two years. I don't want to buy GE and I don't buy Panasonic, either.----Replaced a broken GE with a similar size and power. The best part is ""Sensor Reheat"". It automatically calculates power and duration for the best result. Tested it on the first day to reheat Indian curry and worked very well. Compared to the GE, this one heats things up much more uniformly. Inverter defrost also worked perfectly. Love it!"
5,"This is a great microwave. It is very quiet, easy to operate, and it is attractive. It has a zillion functions and is large inside. We really like it."
4,"This says professional & it really is a nicer microwave.  I will say, it has power & is nice & does the job well & thoroughly of warming up food & cooking food.... but be prepared. This thing is MASSIVE! I wasn't expecting it to be as large as it is.  If you have the space for it, its really nice... but in a world of clean counter tops, this baby will take up a lot of room.  So you have to depend if you want pretty or functionable.  & its not fair to say choose between pretty because the stainless steel is nice to look at - but its a LOT to look at ;)"
5,We bought this microwave almost two weeks ago. I was very impressed with the look. It has great features my favorite is the smart cook. You choose one of the items you want to cook and Smart cook knows how long it will take to cook. It has a few more great features. It is a good overall microwave and I would recommend it.
2,Came with wrong plate. Doesn't fit microwave.
3,The door latch lasted 6 times then it broke . Had to send it back .
1,"Broke suddenly after 4 months of light use (won't power on at all). It was a bit tall for a small microwave and too small for a dinner plate.Really upset that Farberware ignores warranty repair requests. I've called 877-648-5973 four times, been promised a call back with instructions, and never receive a callback. It's just a call center that submits the request, it's not Farberware themselves."
1,What a piece of crap. Had an issue with daylight savings like everyone else. Updated firmware and now the microwave won’t reconnect back to wifi no matter what I do.Seriously how pathetic. Don’t buy this microwave. Shame on you Toshiba…
3,"I just opened this microwave/air fryer today.  So excited to be able to have a micro and air fryer in one and get rid of one large appliance on my counter.  I have not used the microwave yet; however, during unboxing there was a yellow sticker on the control panel that was almost impossible to remove, left glue residue that won't come off and even worse, under the sticker was a ""pock"" mark (raised bump) that is always going to be visible and look bad.  I contacted the manufacturer and they won't help with this.  I will keep the item but am not feeling too happy with GE right now."
4,I am running this unit of a pure sine wave inverter on a yacht. Unit works very well but is a little noisy with a hum. I am not sure if that is from the inverter. Cooks food well for its wattage
5,I was a little iffy buying this because some of the reviews stated it burned out after a year. I've had this a year and a half and it's still holding strong. I use this almost daily. Mainly for heating up food. I never heat more than 2 minutes and when I do I usually stop after every 30 seconds to stir. I haven't used defrost or baked potato or any of the other features besides the popcorn button so I can't speak on that but it's worth the purchase in my opinion.
3,It's a microwave. It worked great until the rotating glass carousel stopped working. Now it works without a rotating glass tray.
4,"I have no complaints whatsoever with this microwave.  It works well, and was a good price.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not some elaborate fancy device, nor is it really big.  It's used mostly for the occasional lunch at work in a small office, so I'm not sure if I would recommend it for someone who wants to use it heavily.  That being said, it's a good product for the price and I would purchase it again.Side note: when I initially purchased this microwave, the box arrived looking like a really big person had sat on it.  The microwave was completely bent out of recognition.  I of course returned it with no problem and received a replacement microwave, hassle-free."
5,There's nothing I disliked about it. Great microwave. Would definitely have others buy it. Awesome !
3,"I love the unit and the ease of use.  I like being able to control it by voice and by phone app.  I did knock one star off because not all commands given in the instruction work.  You get the response ""The command is not supported"" For Example Alexa, Microwave 1.5 ounces of popcorn.  Alexa microwave 4 ounces of chocolate, Alexa microwave 8 ounces of butter.  I even tried Alexa microwave 1 stick of butter because in the app the measurement is in sticks.  Still no success.I do love the bright white light interior, and the end-of-cycle sound is much better than my old microwave.  All in all, I would recommend it.  I just wish they would update the Alexa Skill to match the user manual.Update:  The clock is stuck in Daylight Savings.  Even if you manually set it the unit will change back.  I contacted Toshiba support and their response is that they are sorry but there is no way to fix the time and that it will set itself to DST.  So I ding them another star.  My clock will be wrong until March."
1,"The Negative/One Stars are correct at least with my unit.  First, a loud hum would start when I started the unit. After 4-5 seconds it toned down to a normal low hum. The loud hum increased in time over 3-week to about 10-12 seconds.  Not good.The bigger issue was the grinding of the turntable mechanism.  Chattering got worse over the three weeks and no amount of reinserting, cleaning, dusting stopped it.  Last, heating became uneven including the suggested times per item (s).  Cannot recommend this unit.  Made by Hamilton Beach no less."
1,Worked ok for 5 months and then it just stopped working and panasonic support is garbage..stay away from this
4,"It's a little smaller than I thought it would be,  but it works great once I figured out how to properly use the air fry mode. Haven't yet tried the convection oven feature, but I expect it isnot much different from the air fryer mode. I mostly use the microwave feature,  but you definitely need to read  the instructions first. Overall I can recommend this to anyone who needs a small compact multi feature oven."
1,"My microwave stopped working after 6 months I didn’t purchase the warranty, it seems like a shortage inside.If you buy make sure you purchase a warranty it’s garbage that’s why it’s so cheap"
3,"The bar you push to open the door works so hard you have to hold on to the microwave or it just slides to the back of the counter. Also, the start button stopped working and so you can't set a specific time, you have to just use the pre-set express buttons. Definitely wouldn't recommend this."
3,Heats very well but this unit is LOUD.  Much louder than all the other microwaves I have owned.
4,"For its size, this microwave performs very well.  I like the pre-set timer for commonly microwaved foods, making it easy to select and get the timing right.  I love the crisper function, my old microwave did not have this.  The microwave is compact, so it doesn’t take up that much space on my countertop.  Very good quality microwave for the price point."
1,It was a great microwave when Alexa was able to control it. Now Alexa doesn't work at all on it. I wish I could return it but it's too late. Now that it doesn't work through Alexa I have to use the Midea app or the buttons. The app is easy to use unless you need seconds in addition to minutes. If you need seconds that can't be done with the app. You can set it for a maximum time through the app for 90 minutes. Now I have never cooked anything in a microwave that took more than 15 minutes so why do they make an app that you can't use seconds? If you look at the app in the Alexa skills and search Msmartlife you will see every review has one star because everyone has the same problem.  Amazon needs to get with Toshba and find a fix.
5,Exactly what was advertised
2,"It worked fine for heating up foods. However, it was not large enough to pop a bag of microwave popcorn. Then, 16 months after purchase, after somewhat minimal use (maybe 1-2 times a week to heat leftovers) it quit working."
4,No manual. Had to print it online
5,Had this same model in black for probably a decade. Built like a tank. Only reason I got a new one is because of aesthetic reasons. Here's to another.
5,Better than my last small microwave. Easy stay clean interior.
4,The item is a great microwave combo that is a fairly simple item to use. The one thing that really ticked me off was it came with a very basic operation instructions book. To get a more detailed one that shows you how to actually use all the functions you have to go online and download one. Very inconvenient in my opinion.
5,"Firstly, I have to say that this microwave oven is incredibly easy to use. The digital display is clear and user-friendly, and the push-button door is convenient and hassle-free. The turntable ensures even cooking, and the oven heats food quickly and evenly.One of the standout features of this microwave oven is the child safety lock, which provides peace of mind if you have young children around. My tenant has 2 young children and this feature ensures that the oven can only be used by adults, which is an excellent safety precaution.Another aspect of this microwave oven that I appreciate is its compact size. It's perfect for a small space without taking up too much counter space.Overall, I highly recommend the BLACK+DECKER Digital Microwave Oven with Turntable Push-Button Door and Child Safety Lock. It's a great appliance that performs well and is easy to use. Plus, its compact size and safety features make it an excellent choice for anyone living in a smaller space."
3,"I have purchased two models of Panasonic Inverter microwaves from Amazon Warehouse Deals and had to return them both.  Both had the same problem.  They worked okay for a week, then would no longer cook.  The timer would count down, but the microwave never ran.  I see there are lots of issues with these inverter microwaves.  I really wanted the inverter technology and I love to save money, so I took the risk.  Returns are simple, but being without a microwave is a challenge for some of us :)  After 2 returns, I bought a third one new and haven't had any problems.  So if it's been returned once, just don't bother!ETA:  After almost one year with my new microwave, it's still operating perfectly... In a household of seven with frequent daily use :)  The only thing I don't like is that the glass plate gets off track fairly easily.  Love using true half power to warm or melt things!"
2,"I enjoyed the size and features of this microwave for the two years of light use (one careful person), but then it died. Of course, the microwave is out of warranty. I notice lots of reviewers are mentioning similar problems with their microwave dying a premature death.  I expect better than two years out of a brand name appliance."
1,"Good value for the money until we found out it has exactly ONE YEAR LIFE SPAN. The trouble shooting is ""plug it into another outlet"" nope still DeaD. It's perfect for what we needed but at this price it's better to go with something super cheap from Walmart instead. If I knew I would be paying $$$ for something to last EXACTLY A YEAR. And fail IMMEDIATELY after the return window. Well. I won't be doing as much business through Amazon anymore. At least Walmart gives you a year return window exactly and not cut you off two weeks short ( we didn't even receive the microwave on Sept 4th 2022 it was a few days after that .. )Guess it will go out on the street with a free sign. Maybe someone can use it for spare parts. Looks brand new. Is still very clean.  No power surges over night and it's just dead for no other reason than I think this is what it was designed to do.Thanks for being super expensive and then failing immediately after you didn't have to keep working. Glad we live in the disposal age where all our money means nothing.I have a special needs child and I often need to heat things up but I guess today we will have to use the actual oven and increase our energy bills. Awesome. Can't afford a new one so we are literally up the creak. Thought a good name brand like this would come with better support than ""did you try plugging it into another outlet?"" ."
3,I like this microwave its size is perfect to fit into my baker's rack if he does things nicely it is a little touch sensitive on the pad and it does in fact interrupt your Wi-
1,Worked good while it worked but unfortunately didn’t last long.
5,"A perfect counter top microwave. Powerful, easy to use, plenty of options."
5,I Really Like My Microwave
4,I wish it had more features but it’s good for the price. We put it in our office area and it’s mostly used for snacks and popcorn.
4,I got this to help save space and not have a separate machine for everything. The only downside is occasionally it has a glitch
5,"This was an amazing buy, great for small spaces but still can pop a normal size bag of popcorn with no issues, works perfectly, looks good and easy to use!!"
5,Works great.  Just the right med size. Looks sharp on the counter. I prefer the pull open door s the kind you have to pick a button. This is better. Easy wipe clean up inside and out. The only problem is you can't see the number panel if the light is off. You even have you either have to open the door of the microwave and put your finger on the button or turn the light on in the room. Too bad engineers haven't figured out how to make the buttons glow in the dark or backlite them ....and they're not either. I don't think any of them are. Are they?My last microwave was the same you could'nt see  the number panel in the dark.
1,"The seal between the two glasses leaked after three weeks. I'm concerned that radiation is leaking as well. If someone could speak to this, I would greatly appreciate it. The quality is very poor. My previous microwave was the same size and watts (900), and would completely pop a small (personal) bag of pop corn in 60 seconds. This one requires 88 seconds by comparison. My recommendation would be to look elsewhere."
1,Burned  out in less than 14 days
5,"Love this big size and @ 1100 watts it cooks a bit faster so I do cut down by 10 15 30 seconds depending on the food. Very happy with the look, usability and function."
4,Plenty of room inside on cramping
2,"It was a microwave, it seemingly worked great for while, but glad I got the warranty"
5,"Great little microwave! It took a bit to get used to it, because it was smaller and less powerful than my previous microwave, but it still works great. Just have to adjust cooking times. It looks really good too! Great for small kitchens!"
5,"We don't like that there is no handle on the door, all other features are good."
4,"On occasion, the turn table will move. Good oven."
5,Nice.
2,Reheating vegetable with no liquid in container or a cup of water for coffee and the result is the same; a lot of condensation!  Have never had to spend so much time drying out a microwave before.  Have purchased much cheaper ones with far better performance.  Would not buy agian and was not eligble for return after 30 days.
5,Bought this for my beach house to set on counter.  Like the small size and does everything a large one does.
4,"The oven is quiet and fast. Alexa even makes it fun to use. But there are a couple of problems. The door only opens 90 degrees when 180 would be much more convenient. The turntable does not move with power off, so that while you're reaching around the door you have to stretch to get the item which has stopped at the back of the oven. Those cost a star.After several months the oven no longer responds to Alexa. Judging by other reviews, this is a common problem with no fix in sight.They rewrote the program. Works as advertised now."
5,Perfect size and functionality options in a small unit. Love it.
4,Works well. I would have given 5 stars except the touchpad is hard to see unless there’s a bright light on
5,"Not only is this microwave absolutely stunning, but it works perfect. I am always anxious when I buy a new microwave because you never know how good it’s going to work. This exceeded my expectations and looks absolutely stunning while doing so. I would buy this microwave over and over again but I don’t have to because it works amazing and I expect this to last very long time."
4,"I love the color and that it fits in my kitchen scheme.  It works fine, as expected. Normal micro noises, not too loud, but not silent either.BUT, what I really needed was the same large interior to match my old micro that gave out.  I measured the old one and compared it to the images shown. What arrived did not match.The interior is a FULL INCH SMALLER both height and width.  So, I'm very disappointed that it has a smaller interior than advertised, but we are adjusting I guess. Just disappointed. The images should be corrected to show the correct interior size."
5,In an another Review i stated one needs To be clear Of the requierements. Having Said that if you want To defrost a 17 pound Turkey this might Not be the Oven for you.My requirements small. I checked many small ovens und Most Of them had terrible Reviews.  This one had a few Bad ones gut i took a Chance.I got sick und im bed ridden. I need To warm Up water or coffee und warm Up Food. Soups und small planes Of Rice or veritables.This thing does the Job fantastic. I use the 1 und 2 settings.  My Food or water comes out perfect.Potencial issues: there is a rotating plate below this needs to rotate if It doesnt then the Food is warm in only one area.  This easy to fix.  One Time i put a very tall Glass and It didnt Do a good Job.This ges back to a 600 Watt oven cant behave as a 1200 Watt one.  One you unterstand this you schuld be a Happy camper as me.I strongly recomend this item as Long as you use common Sense
4,"We have run the gamut of countertop microwaves. Our Sharp worked great for 5 years but the push button failed. The replacement Panasonic with inverter was great but it always interfered with our WiFi. We then went to a stylish LG but it failed after 2 years. The replacement GE just died in 16 months, just past the warranty period.All of this appears par for the course for countertop microwaves and we are now trying out the Toshiba. Our priority is longevity, and that's TBD. This microwave has a push in door so making noises is unavoidable opening and closing, but it also squeaks. Other than that it works well and I love the memory feature which I use to make oatmeal (6 minutes at power level 6)."
3,"I like it but it leaked vapor around the door edges first time I used it. I was going to return itbut I need one now and I have decided to keep it since I don't want any more hassle.It is doing as least what I needed it for.I bought a replacement one, that was too big for my spot,  and was having trouble getting it back to Amazon.Fortunately Amazon rep says they will pick it up for me. I am happy with that."
2,"Not!! Came in ripped up taped box, but thought “ ok maybe it’s just the box” but nope!! The microwave has dent so big in the side back corner that the metal side is ripped away from the back and dented up!! Unfortunately the new return policy sucks!!!"
3,I had been looking at this microwave for a while and I finally got it and it fits well in the space. It's not so large that it's in my face and it's easy to use. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the noise. I noticed the noise a couple of  weeks after I purchased it.
4,Air fryer as well as microwave
1,Defective model. Timer counts down but dish doesn't rotate so I'm assuming motor is broken.
2,"It was packed very well was a open box deal,  Microwave came with dent on top right back side an sits unlevel due to right side legs being indented. 🙄 Old adage, you get what you paid for ! I quess 🥹"
2,"I liked the idea of a microwave and convection oven combo. Everything worked fine right until the warranty ran out. First the light started flickering and eventually quit completely. No big deal as a spare LED bulb is only around $5-10, however the chassis has to come off to replace it. Now, about 3 years later, the 7-segment display is on its way out, only displaying garbage. Spare parts are har to get. Very disappointing garbage product after all."
1,Seems like a known issue with these Panasonic microwaves. Terribly unreliable and no support or resolutions available outside the narrow return and warranty window.
5,"The associate was careful, polite,& wonderful personality!! Ty."
5,The micfowave is just right for my kitchen counter to heat frozen veggies.
1,When I first started using the unit I noticed that the keypad had some signs of wear and tear but I went ahead and used it. The unit was too big for me to put back in the box and ship it back and I figured as long as it worked and did what it was supposed to do that it would be all right. I've only used the microwave part of it and it does what I need it to do. I'm only unhappy because it appears to be used and I purchased it new. I don't cook any large meals or anything it's basically to heat up some food and my coffee water in the morning. If it had not been so huge I would have returned it. Getting it out of the box and setting it up was all I could manage. If it does not last I will consider the lesson learned.
3,The microwave looks very nice but it makes so much noise compared to my old one that I start to wonder if it is sealing properly as the door moves a bit when pushing it up.  Also was not level on my counter and had to put something under one leg.  It is not that easy to use because the numbers and other function keys are printed very small.  I don't enjoy hearing the noise it makes.  Very annoying.
5,"I have never owned a microwave that was this quiet! I almost thought it wasn't working.  The stainless steel covering is easy to clean, as is the inside."
5,"Love this microwave, the defrost is excellent"
5,"Note: I'm a former Electronics R&D Technician - ASET.We just got this two days ago and our old Sharp Carousel microwave oven, which had lasted about 15 years, had died last week, so I set it up the same day.I love it! It's intuitive to use, just like the old one was. I ordered this particular model because of the numerical key pad, which is like our old one. Some of the newer ones have a dial, where you dial up the time, and that sounded like a hassle. With the numerical keypad, I can just enter 245 and Start, and it will cook at full power for 2 minutes and 45 seconds. Very nice.https://www.amazon.com/review/create-review/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_wr_but_top?ie=UTF8&channel=glance-detail&asin=B01DEWZWGCBut this new one has something special. That ""Inverter"" technology. At first, I didn't understand what it meant. Yes, from my background, I knew what inverters are, but it seemed to have nothing to do with what this oven does. So here's what I've learned:In my old oven - EVEN THOUGH it had a turntable - I would cook something like a frozen dinner, that had maybe a 4"" diameter piece of chicken in it. It would come out with the end of the piece rubbery, and the rest cooked ok. Sometimes it did that on rice too. Or sometimes I would cook something and part of the dish would be hot, and part cool.Long story short: This oven doesn't do that! My frozen dinners have uniform cooking, with no rubbery stuff and everything is a nice even hot meal! It's like a well cooked restaurant meal!How does it do that?The old oven technology - even though it has the ""carousel"", which helped some - would cook with the microwave power either all on, or all off. So if I set it to warm something up for 3 minutes on a power of 5 ( 50% power ), it would cycle the full 100% power on and off, 50% of the time, over that 3 minutes.But what THIS ""Inverter"" technology seems to do, is keep the microwave power actually AT 50% for the entire 3 minutes. So it isn't slamming the food with either all or nothing. It's a nice even cooking! I love the difference!The only thing I might have done differently is not to name it ""Inverter"", which doesn't make sense to me. I might have called it ""Proportional Power"" or ""Variable Power"", or something like that. But what the heck. It's the results that count and I love the results! Very happy with this!8-29-18 Update: I just heated 2 cups of water to a boil, in a pyrex cup, for making tea. But I forgot about it. I came back 15 minutes later and realized that I have to heat it again. But instead of coming to a boil, it exploded, spraying HALF of it all over the inside of the oven! I don't know how to reach the seller, but if they can contact me, and explain this, I can remove this part and go back to the good review again."
5,"I like this oven, easy to use"
1,I liked how it worked for a short time and then it decided to build up smoke inside the microwave and outside of the microwave filling my kitchen instantly with gray smoke from ceiling to floor.
4,"This is a nice microwave, but I have not figured out how to 'air fry'.  I'm confused by the name saying it's a combo microwave/air fryer/convection , but no instructions on how to cook on 'air fry' even though there is an air fry button.  There is convection instructions, which I'm told is the same thing.  BUT, I have tried to cook tater tots in it twice on 'air-fry and convection' and they would never brown and crisp.  I kept them in there much longer than it would've taken tots in my older, smaller air fryer.  I had hoped this appliance would eliminate having an air fryer sitting out, but I'm thinking I'm going to have to get a smaller one again.  Other than that, and worst instruction booklet ever, I have no complaints."
5,perfect
4,"I love to bake, but I dreaded turning the oven on in this South Texas heat.  So I purchased this microwave convection oven hoping I could continue baking all summer long.  Although it has made a difference temperature-wise, I have to admit it is noisy and arrived unbalanced (annoying).  Not knowing how to fix that I folded a paper towel underneath which I shouldn't have had to do.  I'm not happy with the fact that the inside back panel has already discolored.  I'm using it and it bakes just like a regular-size oven and don't regret the purchase."
1,"The microwave stopped working shortly after it arrived in June 2021.  I called Toshiba where they asked me to plug, unplug etc to try to get it to work. It didn’t work.The rep said they will refund me my purchase price. He had me provide him with serial number as well as send in proof of purchase from Amazon along with my address, telephone number, email etc. many weeks went by and I did not hear from Toshiba.I started calling and sending emails. Eventually I was sent an email with muy address on it and it said I needed to confirm my address (which I had already provided to them in the initial exchange AND was on my proof of purchase from Amazon) so they can refund. I replied to the email and confirmed the address.Again many weeks went by and I never heard from Toshiba again. I started emailing and calling them again. Eventually I received another email saying it’s been submitted for review. Time went by again with no contact from Toshiba.Another round of emails and calls to chase up the refund and I got an email saying it’s now been submitted for approval (versus for review in earlier email).Each time they inform me that they will get back to me in 1-2 business days. But I never hear from them again until I start chasing them up.The last round of my chasing them up was earlier in December. I’m still waiting to hear/receive anything from Toshiba.So the product is defective. And the process to claim is worse than the defective product. It is clear that they are dragging this out as long as possible and making it as difficult as possible in the hope that the customer will just give up and go away so they don’t have to pay out."
1,"The 1st one didn't work I called for tech help (think it was Toshiba) and they told me to return it. The ""new"" one conked out after a month, smelled like it was burning. I called amazon they switched me over to Toshiba/Midea customer ""service"" who wanted the 25 digit serial number on the back of the unit, a copy of an invoice, etc........emailed to them. Went back and forth for about 4 phone calls, they would call me I would give them info that morning and they would call back the next day. I will grant you my invoice did say $0 but as I explained that I had an amazon gift card, points from my amazon credit card and the rest on that card also. When it became apparent that Toshiba/Midea didn't want to make good on their defective unit -I called amazon and they sentme a return label and creit. I Will never buy from Toshiba again."
2,Small & compact but Loud when in use. Anything wet (even if covered) I warm up causes inside the microwave to sweat (soaked) and outer warms up when in use.
3,"I love (d) this microwave, most importantly because it fit perfectly into my smallish cabinet. It died yesterday and it's got a one-year warranty. So I can only recommend it with a qualification: expect it to last only 18 months. Most microwaves I've had have lasted longer. That said, I bought it again knowing it'll fit into that small space. Maybe I'll be lucky and it'll last longer 🤞"
3,The numbers on the microwave are partially showing the time I have not even had this microwave 6 months. Not good at all
5,It is a learning process and I suggest to monitor the food at first.
1,Everything but the microwave isn’t heating up properly
3,"Nice for the money but a little noisy when shutting the door. So far so good, great buy"
3,"not bad, it just went out today, lasted us only 3 years."
3,"My wife told me things were taking much much longer to cook than the rating stated on packages of microwavable veggies.I told her ""they always LIE on the package and it takes longer normally...""Then I tested the new unit we had and it turns out it is a 900 watter NOT 1200 as advertised.I hate it when the wife knows MORE than I do...So....It's BIG.  It COOKS fairly fast BUT it is NOT a super powerful unit..The test was done both using the ""boil"" method (took exactly two minutes to boil 16 oz of ice cold water).PLUS I used the scientific method of a 70 degree LITER of water heated for 2:03 minutes and it measured exactly 900 watts using that method.I am getting a reliable 120volts PLUS at the wall so I don't think it was something wrong with the installation..."
3,It's very noisy.and not big enough
3,"After a year and half use, all of sudden, light goes out, rest of the functions seems to be ok.  Apparently there is no replacement option for the bulb, I was told to get a new one.  That reply is making me look for some thing else.  Cleaning is not that easy either, if one forgets to cover the food...."
1,Bought this about 2 years ago.  Worked fine up until several months ago when it quit working one day.  Problem is that the door doesnt  always close properly--I have to stand there and hold it shut for it to work.
1,Product started making a horrible noise after only being in service less than one month.  We just built a new kitchen with a custom cabinet especially made to house this unit.  This is a pretty substantial set back.  I wanted to attach the video but the file was too big.  Totally disappointed!
5,"I am very pleaed with this microwave.  As difficult as it was to make a choice on line I am glad that I did with this product.  It's easy to use, convenient pre sets, attractive and easy to clean.  I replace it with an older, bigger and more power, but I guarantee you this microwave is a powerhorse also.  I highly reommend it."
2,"The microwave was broken after few months, could not refund.  Had it fixed under warranty, delivered to the contracted technician on 02/14.  Waited for 3 weeks and got it back, but was broker again with same error message H98 end of March, basically, it was working for about 1 week for us!We could have it delivered again, and wait have it fixed!  The drive is 30 mins, and the wait time is many weeks ....  Frustrating!"
2,"Of all the microwaves I have used, I did not find this microwave to be user friendly.  When choosing a selection, buttons are uncooperative at times."
4,Fit my needs
3,"I bought mine Feb 24 2020, I just put a cup of water in to make some tea, about 30 seconds later I heard a funny sound, when I looked the microwave was on fire inside, it should last more more than 3 years."
3,"Update: after contacting the company they have refunded the purchase amount..After having it for 3 months the microwave suddenly would not turn off. It was running I opened the door and when closing continued to run. Nothing will make it turn off except unplugging it, when you plug back in it continues to run. It also has an electrical smell. Tried contacting Amazon they directed me to manufacturer for warranty of course can’t get ahold of them and you all know it’ll be a headache trying to send back, repair be without a microwave until they repair and probably have to pay shipping and packing material to send back. I wouldn’t buy this !"
3,"The clear cover that is put over the keypad area has started to buckle on the start button. The button still works, but it is unsightly to look at. Bought the microwave at the end of November for a new home we were taking possession of in January. So it was in the box until the first part of January. We aren't even to the end of February and this has happened. We are empty nesters, so it doesn't get a ton of use. Irritating to have an essentially new appliance that looks so unsightly!"
1,"We purchased this microwave and it barely made it two years. We used the microwave moderately, but it stopped working two weeks ago. Since it was out of warranty, I was directed to call the manufacturer. They told us there was nothing they could do because it was out of warranty. Their solution was to call someone to repair a barely two year old microwave. The cost for the service call was more than the microwave. I cannot express in words my disappointment that a two year old microwave that is used properly and care of just stops working."
4,"Door closes very loudly.  Works well, though and looks great.  It's small, but now leaves more counter space for other things."
4,This is a good microwave. More attention should have been made to the design of the lock/unlock button. It is clunky and difficult to use with arthritic fingers. All the other buttons are easy to use.
3,Receive microwave with a cracked glass insert.
1,"I got it and plugged it in, it turned on but it wouldn't heat anything. I contacted amazon and they wanted me to trouble shoot it. I asked to return it and I was informed that I would have to take it to a facility to ship it out or I could pay to have it picked up from my house. Amazon's been slowly going downhill over the years."
4,"Nice looking, very quiet to operate. Stainless steel interior makes cleaning easy. I used the convection function once o reheat pizza, and worked well-like my regular oven. My only issue is that the instruction booklet is very basic and doesn’t describe how to use each function -it tells you the steps (press this, enter that) but does not tell you the purpose of each function and how you might use it. It would be nice to have more details available-even if only online. I’ve posted questions, but only get preformatted answers from the manufacturer that add nothing to what is in the manual."
1,We bought this product and it died within 4 months of the purchase. Working with Panasonic to resolve the warrenty issues. I have called a repair station for this unit and they are having alot of issues with the INVERTER UNITS.  Panasonic is a great microwave however stay away from the inverter type products. RIght now I would not recommend this product.
1,"Bought this microwave on January 2017, paid $152.84.  When we first received it we noticed that the light would flicker when the microwave was on, assumed the sight was lose and we used it like that. Today Feb.,2019 i was warming vegetable and it smelled burned, i opened the microwave and the vegetables were cold and there was smoke coming out of the light vent.  I waited for it to cool off and tried again later in the day and in less then 20 seconds it started smoking again.  I have never had this happen with a microwave before.  Very disappointed in this product, will not buy a Panasonic microwave again."
4,Great that this was the right size for our cabinet but it’s not quite as powerful as the old sharp we had for years? Nice features and like the door handle opening better than the old one which was a push button that broke.
1,"I got this because it was ""visually stimulating"" and it is.  BUT, it's not that easy to use.  It would be nice if they had a button for 1 min, opposed to have to press 1.00.  My food gets so hot that the plate gets too hot to handle and that never happened with my 17 year old microwave I replaced this one for.  I gave my old microwave to my Sister and I'm seriously thinking of trading her this new microwave for my old one back.  Plus, the clock isn't very visible in the dark.  No bueno . . ."
4,I brought this thinking I could get rid of my space hogging air fryer but it's really not an effective air fryer. It takes forever to crisp anything and gets quite hot as well.
3,"I like the microwave, it does lack power and you can get the same one at Walmart for cheaper."
3,Not impressed at all. Overpriced and the door has that cheap sound when closing.
1,"Here is the chronology of my experience with three different models of panasonic microwaves, including this model.I had a circa 2007 version of today's panasonic NN-SN966S-1.6cu (sorry, I don't remember if the model number was the same in 2007) which ran  absolutely fine till October, 2014. I had to recycle it since it rusted from inside, otherwise no technical issues. I was pretty happy with that product and so went for panasonic again.In October 2014, I got a NN-SA661S-1.2cu from WalMart at $110. This one failed in August 2015  with error code H98 (i.e failure in Magnetron circuit). Luckily, it was under the 1-year limited warranty so the Magnetron was replaced by panasonic service center with free labor & parts.  In July 2017, it failed again with error code H98. Since it is no longer under warranty, so I dumped it this time.Next, I wanted to buy a better one which would last longer, and I landed up in NN-SN686S. It looked a bit premium than the earlier model, so I wanted to give a shot at panasonic again. We got this one from amazon at $141 in August 2017. After 14 months, it failed last week (20th October 2018) with error code H98. Our usage is pretty light (not used for cooking but only for warming foods) and we maintained it well, so didn't expect it to fail so soon. I called up Panasonic customer care to check if they would cover the repair, because Magnetron is under 5 year warranty (but labor is limited to 1 year). The automated voice assistant said that it will charge $10 for any out-of-warranty products. I was fine with that too, but panasonic customer care never landed me to a human.  I tried with panasonic support live chat, which does not work at all. Basically don't expect any customer support from panasonic. So, I called up the panasonic service center which is now located 20 miles away. They said Magnetron is covered but labor will be $65 and they accept carry-in for repairs only Mon-Wed. I haven't decided yet if I would take this route....Neverthless, it seems none of the recent panasonic models run longer than 12-15 months. There is definitely a durability issue of the magnetrons. So, if you want to buy a panasonic microwave, consider it as 1 year investment (i.e the warranty period of panasonic).Here is  an update. The panasonic service center charged $25 to diagnose the issue. The inverter is burnt out completely. The inverter is not covered by warranty and the price to replace it is additional  is $162. The total cost $162 + $25 = 187 is more than the price of the microwave. The inverted burnt out which is not covered by warranty. So I dumped it. Will never buy Panasonic in my lifetime."
2,"Not happy with this product.  Cheap, poor quality!!!! Very disappointed wish I had never bought this product!!!! My suggestion is to discontinue this product and find something better.  Very disappointed"
2,"The ratings for this microwave were over the top but the performance has been decidedly underwhelming. It was supposed to be quiet but the brace that holds the glass platter is not well-designed so the platter is loose & makes a lot of noise whenever is is in use. I exchanged it for that reason thinking I had a bad one but the replacement is no better. The inside also had drips of hardened paint in the 1st one I got.Toshiba's customer care was really disappointing. When I was unable to set up the clock in the replacement, I called & the woman who took my call was incompetent. Once she finally understood my issue she said I had to do a special step to make it function. I suggested this be included in the manual but she didn't seem to comprehend that usefulness of including such set-up information.I just wasn't up to returning it a 2nd time but I am very unhappy with this Toshiba. It is far inferior to my old much less fancy & larger microwave that lasted for years. I just don't understand why this one got such high ratings & urge you to look elsewhere."
1,This product was absolutely horrible. I love Farberware but this was very disappointing. Tonight a microwave safe dish caught on fire.
3,The media could not be loaded.The non-adjustable feet of the microwave wobble and is not stable.
3,"I like size, power and look of this microwave. It's very pretty. However, that's where my compliments stop. Without connecting this microwave to Alexa wifi, your microwaving program options are seriouly depleted. I didn't want my microwave connected to wifi and besides  I have Android systems, not Apple. I didn't realize my not hooking up to Alexa wifi would compromise my cooking options so totally when I purchased device. The operating directions/ease of use are very very difficult to navigate. I had to keep a notebook of directions in order to use the  machine. Lastly, right at 2 yr point, microwave stopped working for a 24 hr period despite all my attempts to correct the problem at the time of stoppage. After 24 hrs device started up again. Whatever .. I won't buy another Toshiba product."
4,Smaller than our previous but is working well.
3,Not white as stated . Black as coal.Only used for 3 months . Left for new owners. Did not want to keep since was such a cheap light weight micro. Slid around on counter due to slick tiny feet ;)
1,Had a dent on the corner
3,I finally used the airfryer today and I'm not impressed.  I usually cook 6 wings in a regular airfryer in 25-30 minutes.  I'm on 40 minutes and just added another 10.  The microwave is fine.  Steams a lot.
2,"Convection feature is nice, but the microwave is either not strong enough, or uneven. Reheating plates works fine, but thicker/denser foods remain uncooked in the middle."
3,I had thought it was a stainless steel all over. But only the trim around the door is.
4,"The good: it looks great. The ability to mute the beeping buttons feels like a miracle. It cooks food. The bad: perplexing buttons. Way too much thought had to be put into how to make this work. You need to pick the power level every time before you turn the knob to cook. It’s weird and a little too complex when I just want to heat up my breakfast burrito. Also, you can’t cook and use the timer for something else at the same time. Also, the designers decided that it was crucial for the spinning plate to return to the original  position, and so you’re forced to watch helplessly as it slowly and uselessly spins back, wasting precious seconds I could have spent with my breakfast burrito."
3,"I had this for four years. It worked. I liked that you could turn the sound off by pressing down on the ""8"".Then last week the interior paint started falling off in slabs. The microwave still worked, but it was dropping paint in my food.I read online that you can repaint the inside with special microwave paint, but that didn't sound like my kind of project, so I hauled it out to the curb, put a note on it explaining problem and solution, and after an hour two guys came along in a pickup and loaded it in the back.Farewell, Comfee Microwave. You served me well, but I think I'll buy a different brand this time. Not sure how much microwave paint I ate."
3,Love it but when it gets too hot it makes these long beeps. Don't know how to stop it. But great for it's price
5,"Great size, works great. Good named product"
2,Just okay
1,Purchased this microwave May 2021 and it started on fire.  This item was only used to heat things up.
1,"This oven has a fatal flaw - it does not vent moisture from inside the oven. Consequently moisture condenses inside like rain and it collects in its base. If you don’t wipe it dry, eventually it will rot through the base. Voice of experience."
5,"I was very hesitant to buy this microwave bcuz of all the negative reviews, but I decided to take a chance bcuz there were also a few good ones and I figured there are going to be mixed reviews about every product out there so wth lol anyway, I am so glad I took the chance bcuz it works PERFECT!! It is small (but that is what I wanted) a small dinner plate fits in it but it heats up everything really quick. I am so happy with it!!"
1,This microwave worked for 5 weeks and then simply stopped heating. Couldn’t return because the return window was 4 weeks. Very bad product.
5,Delivered fast
3,measure 3 times order once...this thing is small...
1,"I thought I would really like the GE microwave, but the dark panel was hard to see without a flashlight.  I hated to send it back, but it just wasn't going to work for me.  If you have a bright kitchen, it shouldn't be a problem.  I only had it one day, so I can't give a full review."
4,"Microwave works well. Has a gentle, once-only notification sound, which, if undesired, can still be set to mute. Only problem I have encountered is a nearly month-long refusal by Alexa to obey the ""run"" command because Alexa was somehow convinced the microwave was already running. After repeated software reinstallations, unplugging as well as multiple contacts with Toshiba USA Microwave Tech Support, with unfulfilled promises by well-meaning but unable to help CSRs assuring me that a tech would be getting back to me within 48 hours, I inadvertently discovered how to fix the problem by manually running the microwave but not letting the timer finish out. In my case, the timer stopped at 13 seconds left. I told Alexa to ""Turn Microwave Off"". She did and it did. That seemed to do the trick. I was able to resume having Alexa ""Microwave for 3 minutes 30 seconds"" and have it go back to responding correctly.UPDATE After One year of usage:The microwave itself continues to work wonderfully with all of the aforementioned highlights but my only complaint is the periodic yet consistent (every couple of months) ""quitting"" of the Alexa Skills. Countless chats with both Amazon and Toshiba, the latter which advised me that I should be using the Toshiba iMicrowave skill, which I have been most of this last year until 1-19-2022, when it outright stopped with no recovery this time.After multiple router reboots, microwave unpluggings and reconnects with the companion MSmartLife phone app (which has worked flawlessly the entire time), I discovered that there was an MSmartLife skill way down the list, which after linking with, seems to be working well thus far. Will report back after giving it a chance to prove itself."
3,Nice little microwave however The lights are so dim it’s very hard to see if it’s not dark inside the room
4,It's a BEAST-even at 1050watt. I'm coming from an 1100watt-so not a big difference. Beautiful to look at. It's a perfect countertop size. Easy to clean. It heats your glass/ceramic containers THROUGH &THROUGH. POT HOLDERS ADVISED. And the reason for only 4 stars is what everyone has commented here. I guess I didn't want to believe it. The touch screen IS hard to read in dim light. I've basically memorized my go-to settings. It's pretty BAD. But NOT a deal breaker for how good this appliance works. Get your phone light out and cook your butt off! Buy it!
5,This product is wonderful.  I looked at a lot of microwaves and this one was the best.  Most of them the light goes out when you open the door.  This one the light stays on so you can see inside.
3,"It's very cool looking, but loud. It feels a little flimsy but only time will tell."
5,"We bought this Toshiba microwave as a ""used-acceptable"" with minor scratches.  My husband and I were hard put to find any scratches or dings.  This microwave came in the original box with manual and so far it is working just fine. It doesn't look nor act used at all and I doubt it was used. Thanks Amazon for a great deal on a supposed ""used"" microwave!"
1,"It was nice while it lasted, has a huge interior, now arguing to get it repaired/replaced with Panasonic (and not going well) Got an H98 error on it last night, which essentially means it's dead.  No local repair facility.  Panasonic wants me to send it to them at MY cost, and yes this is a huge drawback to ordering online.  At least with brick and mortar, you could bring it back in and not be out $50 for shipping it back.  Used in the home, sporadically, maybe less than 1x per day."
5,This was a gift for my mom she loves it no problem so far so that doesn’t create any problems for me never really had any problems with RCA products anyway
5,This microwave works wonderfully. I'm very pleased. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
1,"This microware is 2 years old and the paint is chipping off inside.  I have had microwaves for 20 years without this Happening.  GE, you need to a better job."
5,"I just had this delivered today. It came well packed. I will warn you though that it is heavy.So far, I have had no problem reading the buttons contrary to other reviews. Of course, that may be because I have track lighting in my kitchen with led bulbs. The clock was easy to set unlike other microwaves I have owned. I am not going to dread the time change next month.I did download the manual and got myself acquainted with the features before the arrival. .I printed the manual out and put it in a page protector for quick referenceI do miss that there is not a beverage button. However, I am sure that before long I will learn how to heat up beverages without a special button.My first adventure was air frying tater tots using the auto setting of af1. In spite of negative comments about the air fryer, my tater tots didn't take any longer than when I used a countertop air fryer. In fact, they took less time and came out crispier. I can't wait to try cooking food in the air fryer using manual settings for things like boneless chicken breasts.So far, I am very happy with my purchase.  I am especially happy at how quiet it is."
3,Smaller than I thought will have to replace for larger size
4,"I received this last night and am MOSTLY happy with it (so far...!)....HOWEVER, had I read the reviews, I likely would not have ordered this model, even though it had all the features I was looking for (microwave with programmable power levels, air fryer, convection & a broiler!) ~ who could ask for more??  The keypad was laid out well, BUT I didn't read the reviews about it NOT being back lit ~ it IS VERY dark..... I have a small flashlight attached to the side, but it would be durn near PERFECT if I could better read the buttons on the keypad.  Engineers @ GE need to address this issue for all us old folks!  I AM looking forward to using it for a variety of things ~ this all-in-one seems to fill the bill for me, with the one issue I mentioned....  Thank you & GOD BLESS AMERICA!!"
1,"After 19 months, the microwave now randomly starts and then stops on its own accord. It's rather unnerving. I have to unplug it between uses to prevent this. When I do use it, it's noisy and heats unevenly. Looks like I'll be shopping for a new microwave, but it won't be Farberware!"
4,"I've had this microwave a few years, but after about 1 year, I noticed signs of rust appearing between the back wall of the microwave and the sides.  Rust was coming through the paint. I have no other problems with this microwave, it's worked fine since day one and I use it all the time.  I keep my oven clean, if I boil anything in it I wipe down the steam and prop the door open, and still, rust appearing.  I'm afraid to scour it and possibly remove some of the remaining coating, so I'm just living with it.  It may be a small thing, but disappointing nevertheless."
1,Horrible don't waste your money microwave is Horrible doesn't work
1,When you use the 30 second button the food ends up in the way back. They didn’t calibrate it properly. Just annoying!
2,see my headline
4,"Would have given it a 5 star, if it had an option to turn off turntable. Microwave had one setting, when in use, the turntable couldn't be turned off. Ace"
5,"Due to memeory issues we destroyed our perfectly good microwave oven . It still worked but it had a smell that just wasn't fading  so we bought a new oven. I liked the price and it was the size to fit my space in my tiny kitchen. What I like about it is the handle to pull the door open . i really do not care for the push button to open the door system .i have found that the button wears out and has a slower reaction point to opening the door. It has all of the features that are common buttons  on most ovens out there . the light inside is kind of dim , I like brghter lights but I am getting used to the dimmer bulb . i am recomending this brand , its sturdy , good quality for a really good price ."
4,"Ehhh, it’s a micro...easy to use."
2,"As a microwave it's pretty good,  it microwaves things.But for one thing it's way deeper than expected, there's a big projection at the rear several inches behind the main shell.And the convection feature.. well, it works.  Like if you absolutely have to have one and only one kitchen heating appliance then I guess this thing can be used for both kinds of cooking.  But it's not a very good convection oven.Wouldn't buy it again.  I don't like abusing return policies or else I'd return this one actually.  Bleh."
5,This microwave is a good buy for me. It has exceeded my expectations and performs really well. I especially like how quiet it is and how roomy it is inside. It is powerful to handle anything I need to popping popcorn full size bag to defrosting 4 pound chicken.
1,The microwave 'died' after 6 months of light use. The product was used to heat coffee and to warm leftovers. During a reheating this week the microwave sounded like a fuse blew ( that was the type of sound). It ceased working with no power. All electrical connections and panel were checked and in working order. Poor product.
1,This unit gets very hot has no protection need a very large area to be able to use it.I do not recommend this unit this unit gets hit while using the micro settings and gets very hot using the air fryer setting I think this is a very unsafe unit and I would not recommend it to anybody. I have put mine in the garage on a shelf NOT USING IT UNSAFE
4,Black one is sharp looking
1,Another poor product that lasts only one year.
1,"Used it less than a week. Never would sync up with Alexa correctly. Never would stay connected to WiFi.Then, a week into use, it started up all by itself one day. Wondered if it finally had synced to Alexa and it caught a random phrase or what not.Went and hit the cancel button... nothing. Wasn’t connected to WiFi, the light for it was off. Opened the door AND IT STAYED RUNNING!!Slammed the door shut and unplugged it. Waited... then plugged it back in and it started running again.Unplugged it again and started looking, when I turned the microwave around, you could smell burning wires from the inside.So, not safe. Would not recommend. Danger Will Robinson! Danger!"
4,I took off one star because it is not as quiet as I hoped and I haven't used it long enough to determine if it will last as long as my old one - which was pretty noisy - which was 10 years old.  I only use time cook and power levels and the potato button so can't comment on the other functions. I do use the timer feature also. My hope is that it will last as long as my old one - if it does I might come back and bump it to 5 stars.
1,"Like the title says, I just got mine today and immediately noticed it's seconds count really fast. Noticed while cooking and also while setting the clock on it. I matched time with my oven and phone and 2 hours later it was 45 minutes ahead of the other 2. Reset it and it did it again. Also has to cook a lot longer because of this because time exists differently in this microwave somehow."
4,"We had the older version of this model and it lasted 10 years! Very easy controls. It's powerful; put the heat at lower settings for some foods.After it died, the last one we got was very similar to this which was not available. It didn't last even two years. I tapped the outside corner with a plate. The glass shattered, sending pieces as far as 15 feet away, hitting both myself and my dog. It took at least an hour to clean up and we still found tiny pieces for a week after. Fortunately, after some back and forth, Panasonic refunded our money. This model is the one to get if you want a 1200 watt, smaller countertop. it's still very powerful but doesn't take up as much counter space. Hopefully, it will last a long time!"
2,"Good size, worked as advertised for 14 months.  This unit was lightly used to reheat food (1-3 times a day, a few minutes at a time).  Then, without warning, the unit would not heat or stop when the door was closed.  Some buttons on the control panel responded to push, most did not. Toshiba said they couldn't help me because the unit was beyond the 1-year warranty (+2 months).  Repair costs will be nearly equal to purchase price of new unit.  Planned obsolescence??  The impact on the environment if I trash it makes me very uncomfortable, too.  Either way, I won't be buying another Toshiba appliance any time soon."
5,Extremely well made & good product.
2,very noisy and very hard to operate
2,"I have had this microwave for about four months now.  I started having some trouble with it after the first two months of use.  It works, but frequently needs to be unplugged and plugged back in, and to have the clock re-set.  Sporadically, it will click when activated, but won’t run – and the display goes blank, and the keypad becomes unresponsive for several seconds.  When it reactivates, the clock displays “00:00”.  On a couple of occasions, when turning on power, the power runs intermittently, even though a lower power setting was not selected.  The electronics seem to have some “bugs” in them.  Whether I just got a “lemon”, or whether this model has inherent flaws, I don’t know.  Too late to return it.  I do know that I will avoid Toshiba microwaves in the future."
1,"Frozen food did not heat up even slightly when heated for 4+ minutes on high, despite the outside of the microwave heating up. Consider purchasing a different model of microwave until quality control for this model improves."
5,"My first day I already loved it. Temperature seems to max out at 400F. A little lower then the setting says. However, this is normal for ovens. I love all the features. and Cooking modes. Still small enough to leave not's of counter top space. Nice build quality. Good for a small kitchen or studio apt."
1,"First of all if you follow the instructions on how to air fry cheese sticks you will have nothing but burnt messy globs of cheese. The sensor cook function option is a joke it never senses the food and start the cook time count down. The air fryer tray and the elevated trays are dangerous because they are way smaller then the glass plate with no covers on the feet to keep them steady when your trying to put food in or take out. It's noisy, the manual isn't correct, and I don't think it really air fries anything.  So I requested a replacement.  Wow! I got one that had clearly already been used . The front was scratched and it was repackaged with the local newspaper from that person's home town . So I plugged it in and BOOM! It operates the exact same way the first one does. Don't waste your money , buy something else. Sure wish my old one would have been repairable it was 100 times better then this one."
3,The condensation sucks in this microwave...and stays on the glass and under the glass plate. Size is excellent for small spaces but when you have to wipe down the interior after 1-2 mins of use...2.5⭐
1,Bought this in Aug. 2020 and today it blew up for no reason. It was a great small space microwave I will say but just started sparking and stopped.
5,For its price the quality is very good. The heating power is great and it looks nice.
4,We have had it for 1 1/2 years with no problems .
3,"Would be nice if it displayed a message when it's done microwaving like other microwaves. Aside from that, it's just a regular microwave."
5,"I bought this microwave after my other one stopped working. (Ok, the other one caught fire trying to microwave popcorn and it took me 2 weeks to finally commit to buying a new one.) This microwave works perfectly. It's not too big, and not too small.. you can fit popcorn in it, which is what we mainly use it for. I would recommend this if you're looking for a good price and small microwave."
4,"Purchased this for my child's dorm room.  So far so good.  We had another microwave that had too much wattage, but was otherwise perfect, was a little skeptical about this one, so we tested it ASAP,  We are not disappointed.  We understand that we might have to zap something twice, but as of right now, we have not had to do that and we are proud of the product.  It works and goes with he other appliances."
3,"My old microwave need replacing and I thought this combination  model would be great.  The microwave does work.  However, the lack of instructions on the remaining functions has me regretting  this purchase.  I downloaded and printed the booklet (not included) but find very little actual  usable information..  The so called ""presets""  are not for what I want to make.  No basic,simple recipes.  Complicated  sequence of pushing buttons (that you cannot see without a flashlight!)I have had many GE appliances and have to say this is the first I find lacking."
4,It is a little louder than expected.  Other than that it is a good unit for the counter.
1,I bought this microwave for my mom and it did not come with the original packaging. The box the came with was terrible with little to no protection. I noticed it was banged up on the top cover but the worst experience was when I opened the lid saw there were traces of food.Such a horrible experience buying this product. I never leave bad reviews but this happen right in front of my mom. So disappointing!!
5,Good product and good price
5,"I'm a big Panasonic fan, Great bang for the buck. Actually too many features not needed but for the price they come free."
4,"Like the Inverter Technology--operates for the selected time at the selected power level.  It doesn't cycle on and off at full power as microwaves have traditionally done.  If power level 4 is selected for 2 minutes, it operates at 40% power for 2 minutes.  Don't like the noise level.  It is significantly louder than other microwaves we have owned.  But we'll get accustomed to it.  Also like that the door has a full open detent that holds the door open so it won't start swing shut while inserting or removing items from the unit."
1,It worked just fine for 6 months then just completely died. The phone number for customer service provided to me by Amazon was for Toshiba Hard Disk Drives for computers not for Toshiba Appliances.  Apparently a real Microwave / Convection oven will run between several hundred to over a thousand dollars which I completely understand now after throwing money away to this Toshiba junk. I am going to look at a similar appliance to buy locally instead of click this to buy junk 40 LBS to box up  and ship back in original packaging who saves original packaging. Do not buy this dead end product.
5,Good little stove
4,Just what I expected.  Works very well and fits in a limited space.  Smaller on the inside than I'd hoped but not their fault.
4,"The ""buttons"" on this are very difficult to push.Sometimes you need to push on them 2 or 3 times to get it to start."
1,Takes FOREVER to heat anything up. Pasta should not take 5 minutes to be lukewarm. Definitely a good size for a small space but not worth it if I have to triple the time it would take in a different microwave.
5,"So, I'll start by saying Im happy because this is an upgrade for me and much better than my old unit of the same power and size. I wanted to replace it with black stainless to match my other new appliances in my recently renovated kitchen.First thing: Yes, it's lighter than my old Sharp Carousel but its not moving around on my counter during operation and the rubberized feet on the bottom keep it from sliding easily on my butcher block counters.Second: It made a little bit of noise upon using it the very first time...and then became silent. Like so quiet, you might have to look twice to see if it's still running if there are any ambient noises around. I'm sure other reviewers might have gotten a defective unit and that's gonna happen from time to time. But the one I got is very quiet.Three, I wanted a handle door because the button doors get crud in them that's hard to clean and that's gross. It opens easily enough and upon closing, as long as you don't SLAM IT, it is about as loud as my old one.Four, there is a nice little light on the side when opened or operating. See my photo of it during operation.Five, my LED was green but honestly, WHO CARES? You can see it either way so if you're OCD about the color of the LED, you might get green instead of blue.Six, I did want black stainless and my only issue is that its a bit lighter than the product photos. Its not bright nickel but not as dark as my black stainless dishwasher as shown in the collage image on bottom.  In a perfect world, it would be darker. But again, who cares? Its very pretty to me! And for my OCD purposes, I like that the interior is gray, not white, lol.Seven, there is a warning about the top getting hot. It does warm up but you shouldn't be putting things up there anyways.Eight, the five little beeps for end cycle are no louder than any other model I've owned.Nine, I haven't tried the grill out yet but Im intrigued so I'll update my review when I have something ti use it for.Ten, it took two tries to get it here as the first order got lost. But now i3ts here and  I'm happy! :-)"
4,Only negative is the turntable is quite noisy.
1,First off the unit smokes inside at times depending on what you put in it.  Then if you continue using the unit for over 20 minutes continually it will cut off I guess because bit overheats.  You have to press the buttons hard to initiate.  I do not recommend you buy this unit.  It makes the brand name a disgrace they usually make better products.  Stay away
4,"This item was useful, the price was excellent, I think the company has an excellent reputation.  Very useful, the delivery was made in a short period of time.  I truly appreciate it.  It looks modern in the kitchen !!  Again, I appreciate it."
5,"I wouldnt have even bought this unit, if my turnstyle on my old one didnt stop working. If I would have known this model and all the things it does, I would have bought it sooner! The air fryer makes reheating fried food taste just made ( use pot holders or oven grips because it gets HOT!). Im telling you, toss your microwave (new or old), and by this one , NOW! Its absolutely FANTASTIC!"
1,I purchased it and it only lasted 3 weeks and five days.
3,Es algo pequeño y no calienta mucho por el bajo watios
3,"The microwave works well, fits well on the counter, and is nice and quiet compared to my old model. There is one feature that REALLY annoys me, the keyboard is not illuminated at all, not even a small backlight. The keyboard is even hard to read in a lighted room -- the numbers are a grayish color on a black background and blend in together. The clock shines brightly. I often go into the kitchen when it is very dimly lit or dark to heat up an item and push the wrong buttons! It's very frustrating -- I end up opening the microwave and using the interior light to shed some light on the keyboard, or turn on the kitchen light which irritates me more each time I have to do it! It may seem like a minor inconvenience to some, but it feels like a major flaw to me. It's too much trouble to send it back, or I definitely would!  Disappointed!"
3,Inside dimensions do not really fit a dinner plate
3,Bought for a small space it’s perfect easy to use but glass tray on the inside keeps coming off every time I cook something or warm something up very frustrating! I am constantly having to stand there and watch it as I’m warming something up to refix the tray never had this issue before with a microwave.It stopped working completely! Piece of crap!
2,Purchased this in Jan and had to get it replaced. It takes twice as long to heat up food and the face of the microwave (where you press the buttons) is already destroyed. Wish I could get my money back because it is definitely not worth it.
2,not made very well and all of the touch pad is in Spanish not English as shown. would have sent it back if I would have time.
3,Very low wattage. Why can't the small microwaves have the same wattage as the bigger ones? I always have to guess on cooking times
2,Died after 9 months of minimized usage. My 40 dollar one this one replaced lasted 8 years.
4,"We haven't had this unit too long and haven't done much more with it besides heat up leftovers and cold coffee, but so far so good. Controls, so far, not difficult to figure out, but keep the manual handy until your learning curve is on the downhill side! :-) Big plus is that it is really quiet! My refrigerator makes more noise than this. Also, the light inside stays on when cooking so you can easily keep tabs on cooking progress and see if something is about to boil over. This is a big, 1000 watt microwave so not the smallest unit out there but probably comparable to other 1000 watt ovens. We got the red metallic finish, but just so you know, the red finish is only on the front. The top and sides are black. Eh, not a deal-breaker, but i was a bit disappointed by that as i didn't really see that in the photos. Overall, we're very pleased and glad we have it."
